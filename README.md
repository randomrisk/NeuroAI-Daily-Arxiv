<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's capabilities for energy efficient and parallel information processing, promising a solution to the increasing demand for faster and more efficient computational systems. Efficient training of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware requires the development of training algorithms that retain the sparsity of spike-based communication during training. Here, we report on the first implementation of event-based backpropagation on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic hardware platform. We use EventProp, an algorithm for event-based backpropagation in spiking neural networks (SNNs), to compute exact gradients using sparse communication of error signals between neurons. Our implementation computes multi-layer networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons using discretized versions of the differential equations and their adjoints, and uses event packets to transmit spikes and error signals between network layers. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of batch-parallelized, on-chip training of SNNs using the Yin Yang dataset, and provide an off-chip implementation for efficient prototyping, hyper-parameter search, and hybrid training methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing that centers around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks. Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that play significant roles in determining ESN performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) refers to the leakage or accumulation of blood within the skull, which occurs due to the rupture of blood vessels in or around the brain. If this condition is not diagnosed in a timely manner and appropriately treated, it can lead to serious complications such as decreased consciousness, permanent neurological disabilities, or even death.The primary aim of this study is to detect the occurrence or non-occurrence of ICH, followed by determining the type of subdural hemorrhage (SDH). These tasks are framed as two separate binary classification problems. By adding two layers to the co-scale convolutional attention (CCA) classifier architecture, we introduce a novel approach for ICH detection. In the first layer, after extracting features from different slices of computed tomography (CT) scan images, we combine these features and select the 50 components that capture the highest variance in the data, considering them as informative features. We then assess the discriminative power of these features using the bootstrap forest algorithm, discarding those that lack sufficient discriminative ability between different classes. This algorithm explicitly determines the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, assisting us in developing an explainable AI model. The features feed into a boosting neural network as a latent feature space. In the second layer, we introduce a novel uncertainty-based fuzzy integral operator to fuse information from different CT scan slices. This operator, by accounting for the dependencies between consecutive slices, significantly improves detection accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding alterations in structural disorders in tissue or cells or building blocks, such as DNA or chromatin in the human brain, at the nano to submicron level provides us with efficient biomarkers for Alzheimers detection. Here, we report a dual photonics technique to detect nano- to submicron-scale alterations in brain tissues or cells and DNA or chromatin due to the early to late progression of Alzheimers disease in humans. Using a recently developed mesoscopic light transport technique, fine-focused nano-sensitive partial wave spectroscopy (PWS), we measure the degree of structural disorder in tissues. Furthermore, the chemical-specific inverse participation ratio technique (IPR) was used to measure the DNA or chromatin structural alterations. The results of the PWS and IPR experiments showed a significant increase in the degree of structural disorder at the nano to submicron scale at different stages of AD relative to their controls for both the tissue or cell and DNA cellular levels. The increase in the structural disorder in cells or tissues and DNA or chromatin in the nuclei can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations in the tissue and DNA or chromatin damage in the nuclei caused by the rearrangements of macromolecules due to the deposition of the amyloid beta protein and damage in DNA or chromatin with the progress of AD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings demonstrate that STN motor streamlines consistently receive a significant portion of the allocated stimulation volume, suggesting that a consistent portion of the stimulation should ideally focus on the STN motor streamlines. At the example of a small cohort of Parkinson's disease patients, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing constraints is demonstrated. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CAE-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CAE-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The connectome describes the complete set of synaptic contacts through which neurons communicate. While the architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ connectome has been extensively characterized, much less is known about the organization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions between neurons. Understanding how effective communication pathways relate to or diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in neuroscience. Here, we analyze the modular architecture of the $\textit{C. elegans}$ signal propagation network, measured via calcium imaging and optogenetics, and compare it to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy. Compared to the connectome, we find that signaling modules are not aligned with the modular boundaries of the anatomical network, highlighting an instance where function deviates from structure. An exception to this is the pharynx which is delineated into a separate community in both anatomy and signaling. We analyze the cellular compositions of the signaling architecture and find that its modules are enriched for specific cell types and functions, suggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically relevant. Lastly, we identify a "rich club" of hub neurons in the signaling network. The membership of the signaling rich club differs from the rich club detected in the anatomical network, challenging the view that structural hubs occupy positions of influence in functional (signaling) networks. Our results provide new insight into the interplay between brain structure, in the form of a complete synaptic-level connectome, and brain function, in the form of a system-wide causal signal propagation atlas.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The emerging field of the Science of Cities has unveiled previously undiscovered facets of urban life. Contrary to the expectation of chaotic behaviour influenced solely by cultural and geographic factors, cities globally exhibit universal power-law trends in urban scaling. Leveraging recent advances in mathematical descriptions of urban dynamics, this study investigates the interplay among fundamental allometry, fractal dimension, and the number of close contacts within cities. Through a dynamic exploration of these factors, a causal relationship is established, shedding light on the intricate dynamics that shape urban environments. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that the Big Five personality traits play a pivotal role in determining the fractal aspects of urban life. This research contributes to the understanding of urban scaling and proposes a novel connection between human personality traits and the structural patterns observed in cities, opening avenues for further interdisciplinary exploration.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, researchers and industries are deploying gigantic models trained on billions of samples. While training these models consumes a huge amount of energy, human brains produce similar outputs (along with other capabilities) with massively lower data and energy requirements. For this reason, more researchers are increasingly considering alternatives. One of these alternatives is known as synthetic biological intelligence, which involves training \textit{in vitro} neurons for goal-directed tasks. This multidisciplinary field requires knowledge of tissue engineering, bio-materials, digital signal processing, computer programming, neuroscience, and even artificial intelligence. The multidisciplinary requirements make starting synthetic biological intelligence research highly non-trivial and time-consuming. Generally, most labs either specialize in the biological aspects or the computational ones. Here, we propose how a lab focusing on computational aspects, including machine learning and device interfacing, can start working on synthetic biological intelligence, including organoid intelligence. We will also discuss computational aspects, which can be helpful for labs that focus on biological research. To facilitate synthetic biological intelligence research, we will describe such a general process step by step, including risks and precautions that could lead to substantial delay or additional cost.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning methods is an ongoing challenge in medical imaging. Multiple lingering issues exist including domain-shift and applications in low-resource settings which brings a unique set of challenges including scarcity of data. As a step towards solving these specific problems, we propose Convolutional adapter-inspired Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) of MedNeXt architecture. To validate our idea, we show our method performs comparable to full fine-tuning with the added benefit of reduced training compute using BraTS-2021 as pre-training dataset and BraTS-Africa as the fine-tuning dataset. BraTS-Africa consists of a small dataset (60 train / 35 validation) from the Sub-Saharan African population with marked shift in the MRI quality compared to BraTS-2021 (1251 train samples). We first show that models trained on BraTS-2021 dataset do not generalize well to BraTS-Africa as shown by 20% reduction in mean dice on BraTS-Africa validation samples. Then, we show that PEFT can leverage both the BraTS-2021 and BraTS-Africa dataset to obtain mean dice of 0.8 compared to 0.72 when trained only on BraTS-Africa. Finally, We show that PEFT (0.80 mean dice) results in comparable performance to full fine-tuning (0.77 mean dice) which may show PEFT to be better on average but the boxplots show that full finetuning results is much lesser variance in performance. Nevertheless, on disaggregation of the dice metrics, we find that the model has tendency to oversegment as shown by high specificity (0.99) compared to relatively low sensitivity(0.75).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a new approach to the Epileptic Spasms (ESES) detection based on the EEG signals using Vision Transformers (ViT). Classic ESES detection approaches have usually been performed with manual processing or conventional algorithms, suffering from poor sample sizes, single-channel-based analyses, and low generalization abilities. In contrast, the proposed ViT model overcomes these limitations by using the attention mechanism to focus on the important features in multi-channel EEG data, which is contributing to both better accuracy and efficiency. The model processes frequency-domain representations of EEG signals, such as spectrograms, as image data to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns in the signal. The model demonstrates high performance with an accuracy of 97% without requiring intensive data preprocessing, thus rendering it suitable for real-time clinical applications on a large scale. The method represents a significant development in the advancement of neurological disorders such as ESES in detection and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from immersive, high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations enhances ecological validity and allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios based on individual cognitive states. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into inter-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. EEG data were collected from 52 non-pilot participants conducting flight tasks in an aircraft simulation, after which they reported cognitive workload using the NASA Task Load Index. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload using two feature sets extracted from the EEG data: 1) spectral features (Baseline model), and 2) a combination of spectral and connectivity features (Connectivity model), both within the alpha, beta, and theta band ranges. Results showed that the performance of the Connectivity model surpassed the Baseline model. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provided insights into the most influential workload-predicting features, highlighting the potential dominance of parietal-directed connectivity in managing cognitive workload during simulated flight. Further research on other connectivity metrics and alternative models (such as deep learning) in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the possibility of a real-time BCI for the prediction of workload under safety-critical operational conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transfer learning for bio-signals has recently become an important technique to improve prediction performance on downstream tasks with small bio-signal datasets. Recent works have shown that pre-training a neural network model on a large dataset (e.g. EEG) with a self-supervised task, replacing the self-supervised head with a linear classification head, and fine-tuning the model on different downstream bio-signal datasets (e.g., EMG or ECG) can dramatically improve the performance on those datasets. In this paper, we propose a new convolution-transformer hybrid model architecture with masked auto-encoding for low-data bio-signal transfer learning, introduce a frequency-based masked auto-encoding task, employ a more comprehensive evaluation framework, and evaluate how much and when (multimodal) pre-training improves fine-tuning performance. We also introduce a dramatically more performant method of aligning a downstream dataset with a different temporal length and sampling rate to the original pre-training dataset. Our findings indicate that the convolution-only part of our hybrid model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on some low-data downstream tasks. The performance is often improved even further with our full model. In the case of transformer-based models we find that pre-training especially improves performance on downstream datasets, multimodal pre-training often increases those gains further, and our frequency-based pre-training performs the best on average for the lowest and highest data regimes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a computer. It has been widely used in medical diagnosis, rehabilitation, education, entertainment, etc. Most research so far focuses on making BCIs more accurate and reliable, but much less attention has been paid to their privacy. Developing a commercial BCI system usually requires close collaborations among multiple organizations, e.g., hospitals, universities, and/or companies. Input data in BCIs, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG), contain rich privacy information, and the developed machine learning model is usually proprietary. Data and model transmission among different parties may incur significant privacy threats, and hence privacy protection in BCIs must be considered. Unfortunately, there does not exist any contemporary and comprehensive review on privacy-preserving BCIs. This paper fills this gap, by describing potential privacy threats and protection strategies in BCIs. It also points out several challenges and future research directions in developing privacy-preserving BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, EEG-based BCIs face at least three major challenges in real-world applications: data scarcity and individual differences, adversarial vulnerability, and data privacy. While previous studies have addressed one or two of these issues, simultaneous accommodation of all three challenges remains challenging and unexplored. This paper fills this gap, by proposing an Augmented Robustness Ensemble (ARE) algorithm and integrating it into three privacy protection scenarios (centralized source-free transfer, federated source-free transfer, and source data perturbation), achieving simultaneously accurate decoding, adversarial robustness, and privacy protection of EEG-based BCIs. Experiments on three public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed approach outperformed over 10 classic and state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and robustness in all three privacy-preserving scenarios, even outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. This is the first time that three major challenges in EEG-based BCIs can be addressed simultaneously, significantly improving the practicalness of EEG decoding in real-world BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we consider the problem of characterizing a robust global dependence between two brain regions where each region may contain several voxels or channels. This work is driven by experiments to investigate the dependence between two cortical regions and to identify differences in brain networks between brain states, e.g., alert and drowsy states. The most common approach to explore dependence between two groups of variables (or signals) is via canonical correlation analysis (CCA). However, it is limited to only capturing linear associations and is sensitive to outlier observations. These limitations are crucial because brain network connectivity is likely to be more complex than linear and that brain signals may exhibit heavy-tailed properties. To overcome these limitations, we develop a robust method, Kendall canonical coherence (KenCoh), for learning monotonic connectivity structure among neuronal signals filtered at given frequency bands. Furthermore, we propose the KenCoh-based permutation test to investigate the differences in brain network connectivity between two different states. Our simulation study demonstrates that KenCoh is competitive to the traditional variance-covariance estimator and outperforms the later when the underlying distributions are heavy-tailed. We apply our method to EEG recordings from a virtual-reality driving experiment. Our proposed method led to further insights on the differences of frontal-parietal cross-dependence network when the subject is alert and when the subject is drowsy and that left-parietal channel drives this dependence at the beta-band.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transfer learning (TL) has been widely used in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for reducing calibration efforts. However, backdoor attacks could be introduced through TL. In such attacks, an attacker embeds a backdoor with a specific pattern into the machine learning model. As a result, the model will misclassify a test sample with the backdoor trigger into a prespecified class while still maintaining good performance on benign samples. Accordingly, this study explores backdoor attacks in the TL of EEG-based BCIs, where source-domain data are poisoned by a backdoor trigger and then used in TL. We propose several active poisoning approaches to select source-domain samples, which are most effective in embedding the backdoor pattern, to improve the attack success rate and efficiency. Experiments on four EEG datasets and three deep learning models demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first study about backdoor attacks on TL models in EEG-based BCIs. It exposes a serious security risk in BCIs, which should be immediately addressed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from immersive, high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations enhances ecological validity and allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios based on individual cognitive states. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into inter-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. EEG data were collected from 52 non-pilot participants conducting flight tasks in an aircraft simulation, after which they reported cognitive workload using the NASA Task Load Index. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload using two feature sets extracted from the EEG data: 1) spectral features (Baseline model), and 2) a combination of spectral and connectivity features (Connectivity model), both within the alpha, beta, and theta band ranges. Results showed that the performance of the Connectivity model surpassed the Baseline model. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provided insights into the most influential workload-predicting features, highlighting the potential dominance of parietal-directed connectivity in managing cognitive workload during simulated flight. Further research on other connectivity metrics and alternative models (such as deep learning) in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the possibility of a real-time BCI for the prediction of workload under safety-critical operational conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a computer. It has been widely used in medical diagnosis, rehabilitation, education, entertainment, etc. Most research so far focuses on making BCIs more accurate and reliable, but much less attention has been paid to their privacy. Developing a commercial BCI system usually requires close collaborations among multiple organizations, e.g., hospitals, universities, and/or companies. Input data in BCIs, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG), contain rich privacy information, and the developed machine learning model is usually proprietary. Data and model transmission among different parties may incur significant privacy threats, and hence privacy protection in BCIs must be considered. Unfortunately, there does not exist any contemporary and comprehensive review on privacy-preserving BCIs. This paper fills this gap, by describing potential privacy threats and protection strategies in BCIs. It also points out several challenges and future research directions in developing privacy-preserving BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, EEG-based BCIs face at least three major challenges in real-world applications: data scarcity and individual differences, adversarial vulnerability, and data privacy. While previous studies have addressed one or two of these issues, simultaneous accommodation of all three challenges remains challenging and unexplored. This paper fills this gap, by proposing an Augmented Robustness Ensemble (ARE) algorithm and integrating it into three privacy protection scenarios (centralized source-free transfer, federated source-free transfer, and source data perturbation), achieving simultaneously accurate decoding, adversarial robustness, and privacy protection of EEG-based BCIs. Experiments on three public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed approach outperformed over 10 classic and state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and robustness in all three privacy-preserving scenarios, even outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. This is the first time that three major challenges in EEG-based BCIs can be addressed simultaneously, significantly improving the practicalness of EEG decoding in real-world BCIs.</td>

Specifically, we evaluated conventional machine learning techniques such as CSP-SVM and LDA-SVM classifiers alongside deep learning architectures such as EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet. Machine learning classifiers exhibited significantly lower precision and recall, indicating limited feature extraction capabilities and poor generalization between imagined speech and idle states. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly EEGNet, achieved the highest accuracy of 0.7080 and an F1 score of 0.6718, demonstrating their enhanced ability in automatic feature extraction and representation learning, essential for capturing complex neurophysiological patterns. These findings highlight the limitations of conventional machine learning approaches in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and advocate for adopting deep learning methodologies to achieve more precise and reliable classification of detecting imagined speech. This foundational research contributes to the development of imagined speech-based BCI systems.</td>

Dynamic windows enable the classification based on a test EEG trial shorter than those used in training, improving the decision speed; front-end replication fills a short test EEG trial to the length used in training, improving the classification accuracy. Within-subject and cross-subject online MI classification experiments on three public datasets, with three different classifiers and three different data augmentation approaches, demonstrated that FRDW can significantly increase the information transfer rate in MI decoding. Additionally, FR can also be used in training data augmentation. FRDW helped win national champion of the China BCI Competition in 2022.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the direct control of external devices through the imagined movements of various body parts. Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI decoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit triggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to first distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the MI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes a sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based asynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to screen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI classification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by self-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject and cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG datasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the highest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to provide transformative control in prosthetics, assistive technologies (wheelchairs), robotics, and human-computer interfaces. While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive approach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the requirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex algorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world settings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a sliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for real-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional and attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams, reducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data collection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source electroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot over three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical evidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with reduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the practicality and accessibility of BCI technology. This advancement makes BCI applications more feasible for real-world scenarios, particularly in controlling robotic systems.</td>

A synthetic overview of early and more recent linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM, that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed. Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models, the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and user-adaptive neurotechnology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing that centers around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks. Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that play significant roles in determining ESN performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity, measured through functional MRI (fMRI), into latent hierarchical representations. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using latent diffusion models (LDM) via a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Due to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential steps, the first one providing a rough visual approximation, the second on improving the stimulus prediction via LDM endowed by CLIP embeddings. This work proposes a non-linear deep network to improve fMRI latent space representation, optimizing the dimensionality alike. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset showed that the proposed architecture improved the structural similarity of the reconstructed image by about 2\% with respect to the state-of-the-art model, based on ridge linear transform. The reconstructed image's semantics improved by about 4\%, measured by perceptual similarity, with respect to the state-of-the-art. The noise sensitivity analysis of the LDM showed that the role of the first stage was fundamental to predict the stimulus featuring high structural similarity. Conversely, providing a large noise stimulus affected less the semantics of the predicted stimulus, while the structural similarity between the ground truth and predicted stimulus was very poor. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging non-linear relationships between BOLD signal and the latent representation and two-stage generative AI for optimizing the fidelity of reconstructed visual stimuli from noisy fMRI data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spontaneous neural activity observed in resting-state fMRI is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Different measures related to local and global brain connectivity and fluctuations in low-frequency amplitudes can quantify individual aspects of these neural dynamics. Even though such measures are derived from the same functional signals, they are often evaluated separately, neglecting their interrelations and potentially reducing the analysis sensitivity. In our study, we present a fusion searchlight (FuSL) framework to combine the complementary information contained in different resting-state fMRI metrics and demonstrate how this can improve the decoding of brain states. Moreover, we show how explainable AI allows us to reconstruct the differential impact of each metric on the decoding, which additionally increases spatial specificity of searchlight analysis. In general, this framework can be adapted to combine information derived from different imaging modalities or experimental conditions, offering a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.</td>

While previous studies have identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic network approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory to investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks during resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to fear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions would be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to fear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to emotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed participants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in positive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the resting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly decreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward instability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing. Additionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during fear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized network and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's remarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how network stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced triads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex mechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in response to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding emotional resilience and neurological disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The precise detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of significant importance in preventing the deterioration of patients in a timely manner. Although hypergraphs have enhanced performance by learning and analyzing brain networks, they often only depend on vector distances between features at a single scale to infer interactions. In this paper, we deal with a more arduous challenge, hypergraph modelling with synchronization between brain regions, and design a novel framework, i.e., A Multi-scale Hypergraph Network for MCI Detection via Synchronous and Attentive Fusion (MHSA), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach employs the Phase-Locking Value (PLV) to calculate the phase synchronization relationship in the spectrum domain of regions of interest (ROIs) and designs a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to integrate dynamic connectivity features of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from both the temporal and spectrum domains. To evaluate and optimize the direct contribution of each ROI to phase synchronization in the temporal domain, we structure the PLV coefficients dynamically adjust strategy, and the dynamic hypergraph is modelled based on a comprehensive temporal-spectrum fusion matrix. Experiments on the real-world dataset indicate the effectiveness of our strategy. The code is available at https://github.com/Jia-Weiming/MHSA.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain aging involves structural and functional changes and therefore serves as a key biomarker for brain health. Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to improve brain age estimation by leveraging complementary data. However, fMRI data, being noisier than sMRI, complicates multimodal fusion. Traditional fusion methods often introduce more noise than useful information, which can reduce accuracy compared to using sMRI alone. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework for biological brain age estimation, utilizing a sex-aware adversarial variational autoencoder (SA-AVAE). Our framework integrates adversarial and variational learning to effectively disentangle the latent features from both modalities. Specifically, we decompose the latent space into modality-specific codes and shared codes to represent complementary and common information across modalities, respectively. To enhance the disentanglement, we introduce cross-reconstruction and shared-distinct distance ratio loss as regularization terms. Importantly, we incorporate sex information into the learned latent code, enabling the model to capture sex-specific aging patterns for brain age estimation via an integrated regressor module. We evaluate our model using the publicly available OpenBHB dataset, a comprehensive multi-site dataset for brain age estimation. The results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches and shows significant robustness across various age groups, highlighting its potential for real-time clinical applications in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semantic representations are integral to natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence. Although often derived from internet text, recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of behavior-based (e.g., free associations) and brain-based (e.g., fMRI) representations, which promise improvements in our ability to measure and model human representations. We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the similarities and differences between semantic representations derived from text, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information that differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our psychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call representational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior representations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and socio-moral dimensions. We thus establish behavior as an important complement to text for capturing human representations and behavior. These results are broadly relevant to research aimed at learning human-aligned semantic representations, including work on evaluating and aligning large language models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Outlying observations are frequently encountered in a wide spectrum of scientific domains, posing significant challenges for the generalizability of statistical models and the reproducibility of downstream analysis. These observations can be identified through influential diagnosis, which refers to the detection of observations that are unduly influential on diverse facets of statistical inference. To date, methods for identifying observations influencing the choice of a stochastically selected submodel have been underdeveloped, especially in the high-dimensional setting where the number of predictors p exceeds the sample size n. Recently we proposed an improved diagnostic measure to handle this setting. However, its distributional properties and approximations have not yet been explored. To address this shortcoming, the notion of exchangeability is revived, and used to determine the exact finite- and large-sample distributions of our assessment metric. This forms the foundation for the introduction of both parametric and non-parametric approaches for its approximation and the establishment of thresholds for diagnosis. The resulting framework is extended to logistic regression models, followed by a simulation study conducted to assess the performance of various detection procedures. Finally the framework is applied to data from an fMRI study of thermal pain, with the goal of identifying outlying subjects that could distort the formulation of statistical models using functional brain activity in predicting physical pain ratings. Both linear and logistic regression models are used to demonstrate the benefits of detection and compare the performances of different detection procedures. In particular, two additional influential observations are identified, which are not discovered by previous studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder of the central nervous system, which occurs most frequently in childhood and is characterized by unusual and repetitive ritualistic behaviors. Currently, diagnostic methods primarily rely on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observation, which may lead to misdiagnoses due to the subjective evaluation and measurement used in these traditional methods. With the advancement in medical imaging, MR imaging-based diagnosis has become an alternative and more objective approach. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid neural Network model for ASD identification, termded ASD-HNet, to hierarchically extract features on the functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. This hierarchical method can better extract brain representations, improve the diagnostic accuracy, and help us better locate brain regions related to ASD. Specifically, features are extracted from three scales: local regions of interest (ROIs) scale, community-clustering scale, and the whole-communities scale. For the ROI scale, graph convolution is used to transfer features between ROIs. At the community cluster scale, functional gradients are introduced, the clustering algorithm K-Means is used to automatically cluster ROIs with similar functional gradients into several communities, and features of ROIs belonging to the same community are extracted to characterize these communities. At global information integration scale, we extract global features from community-scale brain networks to characterize the whole brain networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method using the public dataset of Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), and elucidate the interpretability of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASD-HNet can yield superior performance than compared methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\% to 54.88\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios.</td>

MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions.</td>

The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</td>

Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of manually labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, using MultiverSeg reduced the total number of scribble steps by 53% and clicks by 36% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks. We release code and model weights at https://multiverseg.csail.mit.edu</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Whole-body PET imaging is often hindered by respiratory motion during acquisition, causing significant degradation in the quality of reconstructed activity images. An additional challenge in PET/CT imaging arises from the respiratory phase mismatch between CT-based attenuation correction and PET acquisition, leading to attenuation artifacts. To address these issues, we propose two new, purely data-driven methods for the joint estimation of activity, attenuation, and motion in respiratory self-gated TOF PET. These methods enable the reconstruction of a single activity image free from motion and attenuation artifacts.   The proposed methods were evaluated using data from the anthropomorphic Wilhelm phantom acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system, as well as 3 clinical FDG PET/CT datasets acquired on a GE DMI PET/CT system. Image quality was assessed visually to identify motion and attenuation artifacts. Lesion uptake values were quantitatively compared across reconstructions without motion modeling, with motion modeling but static attenuation correction, and with our proposed methods.   For the Wilhelm phantom, the proposed methods delivered image quality closely matching the reference reconstruction from a static acquisition. The lesion-to-background contrast for a liver dome lesion improved from 2.0 (no motion correction) to 5.2 (proposed methods), matching the contrast from the static acquisition (5.2). In contrast, motion modeling with static attenuation correction yielded a lower contrast of 3.5. In patient datasets, the proposed methods successfully reduced motion artifacts in lung and liver lesions and mitigated attenuation artifacts, demonstrating superior lesion to background separation.   Our proposed methods enable the reconstruction of a single, high-quality activity image that is motion-corrected and free from attenuation artifacts, without the need for external hardware.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Longitudinal imaging allows for the study of structural changes over time. One approach to detecting such changes is by non-linear image registration. This study introduces Multi-Session Temporal Registration (MUSTER), a novel method that facilitates longitudinal analysis of changes in extended series of medical images. MUSTER improves upon conventional pairwise registration by incorporating more than two imaging sessions to recover longitudinal deformations. Longitudinal analysis at a voxel-level is challenging due to effects of a changing image contrast as well as instrumental and environmental sources of bias between sessions. We show that local normalized cross-correlation as an image similarity metric leads to biased results and propose a robust alternative. We test the performance of MUSTER on a synthetic multi-site, multi-session neuroimaging dataset and show that, in various scenarios, using MUSTER significantly enhances the estimated deformations relative to pairwise registration. Additionally, we apply MUSTER on a sample of older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The results show that MUSTER can effectively identify patterns of neuro-degeneration from T1-weighted images and that these changes correlate with changes in cognition, matching the performance of state of the art segmentation methods. By leveraging GPU acceleration, MUSTER efficiently handles large datasets, making it feasible also in situations with limited computational resources.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding alterations in structural disorders in tissue or cells or building blocks, such as DNA or chromatin in the human brain, at the nano to submicron level provides us with efficient biomarkers for Alzheimers detection. Here, we report a dual photonics technique to detect nano- to submicron-scale alterations in brain tissues or cells and DNA or chromatin due to the early to late progression of Alzheimers disease in humans. Using a recently developed mesoscopic light transport technique, fine-focused nano-sensitive partial wave spectroscopy (PWS), we measure the degree of structural disorder in tissues. Furthermore, the chemical-specific inverse participation ratio technique (IPR) was used to measure the DNA or chromatin structural alterations. The results of the PWS and IPR experiments showed a significant increase in the degree of structural disorder at the nano to submicron scale at different stages of AD relative to their controls for both the tissue or cell and DNA cellular levels. The increase in the structural disorder in cells or tissues and DNA or chromatin in the nuclei can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations in the tissue and DNA or chromatin damage in the nuclei caused by the rearrangements of macromolecules due to the deposition of the amyloid beta protein and damage in DNA or chromatin with the progress of AD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Small lesions play a critical role in early disease diagnosis and intervention of severe infections. Popular models often face challenges in segmenting small lesions, as it occupies only a minor portion of an image, while down\_sampling operations may inevitably lose focus on local features of small lesions. To tackle the challenges, we propose a {\bf S}mall-{\bf S}ize-{\bf S}ensitive {\bf Mamba} ({\bf S$^3$-Mamba}), which promotes the sensitivity to small lesions across three dimensions: channel, spatial, and training strategy. Specifically, an Enhanced Visual State Space block is designed to focus on small lesions through multiple residual connections to preserve local features, and selectively amplify important details while suppressing irrelevant ones through channel-wise attention. A Tensor-based Cross-feature Multi-scale Attention is designed to integrate input image features and intermediate-layer features with edge features and exploit the attentive support of features across multiple scales, thereby retaining spatial details of small lesions at various granularities. Finally, we introduce a novel regularized curriculum learning to automatically assess lesion size and sample difficulty, and gradually focus from easy samples to hard ones like small lesions. Extensive experiments on three medical image segmentation datasets show the superiority of our S$^3$-Mamba, especially in segmenting small lesions.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical report generation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and patient management, summarizing diagnoses and recommendations based on medical imaging. However, existing work often overlook the clinical pipeline involved in report writing, where physicians typically conduct an initial quick review followed by a detailed examination. Moreover, current alignment methods may lead to misaligned relationships. To address these issues, we propose DAMPER, a dual-stage framework for medical report generation that mimics the clinical pipeline of report writing in two stages. In the first stage, a MeSH-Guided Coarse-Grained Alignment (MCG) stage that aligns chest X-ray (CXR) image features with medical subject headings (MeSH) features to generate a rough keyphrase representation of the overall impression. In the second stage, a Hypergraph-Enhanced Fine-Grained Alignment (HFG) stage that constructs hypergraphs for image patches and report annotations, modeling high-order relationships within each modality and performing hypergraph matching to capture semantic correlations between image regions and textual phrases. Finally,the coarse-grained visual features, generated MeSH representations, and visual hypergraph features are fed into a report decoder to produce the final medical report. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAMPER in generating comprehensive and accurate medical reports, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generation with source attribution is important for enhancing the verifiability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing approaches in RAG primarily link generated content to document-level references, making it challenging for users to locate evidence among multiple content-rich retrieved documents. To address this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Visual Source Attribution (VISA), a novel approach that combines answer generation with visual source attribution. Leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs), VISA identifies the evidence and highlights the exact regions that support the generated answers with bounding boxes in the retrieved document screenshots. To evaluate its effectiveness, we curated two datasets: Wiki-VISA, based on crawled Wikipedia webpage screenshots, and Paper-VISA, derived from PubLayNet and tailored to the medical domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VISA for visual source attribution on documents' original look, as well as highlighting the challenges for improvement. Code, data, and model checkpoints will be released.</td>
