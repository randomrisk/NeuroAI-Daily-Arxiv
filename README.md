<td style='padding: 4px;'>Volumetric neuroimaging examinations like structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) are routinely applied to support the clinical diagnosis of dementia like Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Neuroradiologists examine 3D sMRI to detect and monitor abnormalities in brain morphology due to AD, like global and/or local brain atrophy and shape alteration of characteristic structures. There is a strong research interest in developing diagnostic systems based on Deep Learning (DL) models to analyse sMRI for AD. However, anatomical information extracted from an sMRI examination needs to be interpreted together with patient's age to distinguish AD patterns from the regular alteration due to a normal ageing process. In this context, part-prototype neural networks integrate the computational advantages of DL in an interpretable-by-design architecture and showed promising results in medical imaging applications. We present PIMPNet, the first interpretable multimodal model for 3D images and demographics applied to the binary classification of AD from 3D sMRI and patient's age. Despite age prototypes do not improve predictive performance compared to the single modality model, this lays the foundation for future work in the direction of the model's design and multimodal prototype training process</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a challenging task. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data provide in vivo insight into brain health, but the low prevalence of the condition and resultant data scarcity limit training set sizes for prediction models. Survival models are further hindered by the subtle and often highly localised profile of ALS-related neurodegeneration. Normative models present a solution as they increase statistical power by leveraging large healthy cohorts. Separately, diffusion models excel in capturing the semantics embedded within images including subtle signs of accelerated brain ageing, which may help predict survival in ALS. Here, we combine the benefits of generative and normative modelling by introducing the normative diffusion autoencoder framework. To our knowledge, this is the first use of normative modelling within a diffusion autoencoder, as well as the first application of normative modelling to ALS. Our approach outperforms generative and non-generative normative modelling benchmarks in ALS prognostication, demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy in the context of ALS survival prediction and normative modelling in general.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding neural activity and information representation is crucial for advancing knowledge of brain function and cognition. Neural activity, measured through techniques like electrophysiology and neuroimaging, reflects various aspects of information processing. Recent advances in deep neural networks offer new approaches to analyzing these signals using pre-trained models. However, challenges arise due to discrepancies between different neural signal modalities and the limited scale of high-quality neural data. To address these challenges, we present NeuroBind, a general representation that unifies multiple brain signal types, including EEG, fMRI, calcium imaging, and spiking data. To achieve this, we align neural signals in these image-paired neural datasets to pre-trained vision-language embeddings. Neurobind is the first model that studies different neural modalities interconnectedly and is able to leverage high-resource modality models for various neuroscience tasks. We also showed that by combining information from different neural signal modalities, NeuroBind enhances downstream performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different neural modalities. As a result, we can leverage multiple types of neural signals mapped to the same space to improve downstream tasks, and demonstrate the complementary strengths of different neural modalities. This approach holds significant potential for advancing neuroscience research, improving AI systems, and developing neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain metastasis segmentation poses a significant challenge in medical imaging due to the complex presentation and variability in size and location of metastases. In this study, we first investigate the impact of different imaging modalities on segmentation performance using a 3D U-Net. Through a comprehensive analysis, we determine that combining all available modalities does not necessarily enhance performance. Instead, the combination of T1-weighted with contrast enhancement (T1c), T1-weighted (T1), and FLAIR modalities yields superior results. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage detection and segmentation model specifically designed to accurately segment brain metastases. Our approach demonstrates that leveraging three key modalities (T1c, T1, and FLAIR) achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to single-pass deep learning models. This targeted combination allows for precise segmentation, capturing even small metastases that other models often miss. Our model sets a new benchmark in brain metastasis segmentation, highlighting the importance of strategic modality selection and multi-stage processing in medical imaging. Our implementation is freely accessible to the research community on \href{https://github.com/xmindflow/Met-Seg}{GitHub}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper focuses on the analysis of sequential image data, particularly brain imaging data such as MRI, fMRI, CT, with the motivation of understanding the brain aging process and neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve this goal, we investigate image generation in a time series context. Specifically, we formulate a min-max problem derived from the $f$-divergence between neighboring pairs to learn a time series generator in a nonparametric manner. The generator enables us to generate future images by transforming prior lag-k observations and a random vector from a reference distribution. With a deep neural network learned generator, we prove that the joint distribution of the generated sequence converges to the latent truth under a Markov and a conditional invariance condition. Furthermore, we extend our generation mechanism to a panel data scenario to accommodate multiple samples. The effectiveness of our mechanism is evaluated by generating real brain MRI sequences from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. These generated image sequences can be used as data augmentation to enhance the performance of further downstream tasks, such as Alzheimer's disease detection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper develops a novel Bayesian approach for nonlinear regression with symmetric matrix predictors, often used to encode connectivity of different nodes. Unlike methods that vectorize matrices as predictors that result in a large number of model parameters and unstable estimation, we propose a Bayesian multi-index regression method, resulting in a projection-pursuit-type estimator that leverages the structure of matrix-valued predictors. We establish the model identifiability conditions and impose a sparsity-inducing prior on the projection directions for sparse sampling to prevent overfitting and enhance interpretability of the parameter estimates. Posterior inference is conducted through Bayesian backfitting. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulation studies and a case study investigating the relationship between brain connectivity features and cognitive scores.</td>

We carry out the analysis of the unique solvability of the governing equations, and the existence proof relies on an auxiliary multi-valued parabolic problem. We propose a Lagrange multiplier-based mixed finite element method for its numerical approximation and show the well-posedness of both semi-and fully-discrete problems. Then, a priori error estimates for both the semi- and fully-discrete schemes are derived. A series of numerical experiments is presented to confirm the theoretical convergence rates, and we also employ the proposed monolithic scheme to simulate 2D physical phenomena in geophysical fluids and biomechanics of the brain function.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Diagnosing medical conditions from histopathology data requires a thorough analysis across the various resolutions of Whole Slide Images (WSI).

To tackle this, we propose Ultra-Resolution Cascaded Diffusion Models (URCDMs) which are capable of synthesising entire histopathology images at high resolutions whilst authentically capturing the details of both the underlying anatomy and pathology at all magnification levels. We evaluate our method on three separate datasets, consisting of brain, breast and kidney tissue, and surpass existing state-of-the-art multi-resolution models. Furthermore, an expert evaluation study was conducted, demonstrating that URCDMs consistently generate outputs across various resolutions that trained evaluators cannot distinguish from real images.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to interact with the external world using brain activity. Despite their potential in neuroscience and industry, BCI performance remains inconsistent in noninvasive applications, often prioritizing algorithms that achieve high classification accuracies while masking the neural mechanisms driving that performance. In this study, we investigated the interpretability of features derived from brain network lateralization, benchmarking against widely used techniques like power spectrum density (PSD), common spatial pattern (CSP), and Riemannian geometry. We focused on the spatial distribution of the functional connectivity within and between hemispheres during motor imagery tasks, introducing network-based metrics such as integration and segregation. Evaluating these metrics across multiple EEG-based BCI datasets, our findings reveal that network lateralization offers neurophysiological plausible insights, characterized by stronger lateralization in sensorimotor and frontal areas contralateral to imagined movements. While these lateralization features did not outperform CSP and Riemannian geometry in terms of classification accuracy, they demonstrated competitive performance against PSD alone and provided biologically relevant interpretation. This study underscores the potential of brain network lateralization as a new feature to be integrated in motor imagery-based BCIs for enhancing the interpretability of noninvasive applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in object recognition and have been found to share some similarities with brain visual processing. However, the substantial gap between DCNNs and human visual perception still exists. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a widely used technique in cognitive neuroscience can record neural activation in the human visual cortex during the process of visual perception. Can we teach DCNNs human fMRI signals to achieve a more brain-like model? To answer this question, this study proposed ReAlnet-fMRI, a model based on the SOTA vision model CORnet but optimized using human fMRI data through a multi-layer encoding-based alignment framework. This framework has been shown to effectively enable the model to learn human brain representations. The fMRI-optimized ReAlnet-fMRI exhibited higher similarity to the human brain than both CORnet and the control model in within-and across-subject as well as within- and across-modality model-brain (fMRI and EEG) alignment evaluations. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth analyses to investigate how the internal representations of ReAlnet-fMRI differ from CORnet in encoding various object dimensions. These findings provide the possibility of enhancing the brain-likeness of visual models by integrating human neural data, helping to bridge the gap between computer vision and visual neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition is the technology-driven process of identifying and categorizing human emotions from various data sources, such as facial expressions, voice patterns, body motion, and physiological signals, such as EEG. These physiological indicators, though rich in data, present challenges due to their complexity and variability, necessitating sophisticated feature selection and extraction methods. NGN, an unsupervised learning algorithm, effectively adapts to input spaces without predefined grid structures, improving feature extraction from physiological data. Furthermore, the incorporation of fuzzy logic enables the handling of fuzzy data by introducing reasoning that mimics human decision-making. The combination of PSO with XGBoost aids in optimizing model performance through efficient hyperparameter tuning and decision process optimization. This study explores the integration of Neural-Gas Network (NGN), XGBoost, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and fuzzy logic to enhance emotion recognition using physiological signals. Our research addresses three critical questions concerning the improvement of XGBoost with PSO and fuzzy logic, NGN's effectiveness in feature selection, and the performance comparison of the PSO-fuzzy XGBoost classifier with standard benchmarks. Acquired results indicate that our methodologies enhance the accuracy of emotion recognition systems and outperform other feature selection techniques using the majority of classifiers, offering significant implications for both theoretical advancement and practical application in emotion recognition technology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly impacts various key aspects of life, requiring accurate diagnostic methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used in diagnosing ADHD, but proper preprocessing is crucial to avoid noise and artifacts that could lead to unreliable results.   Method: This study utilized a public EEG dataset from children diagnosed with ADHD and typically developing (TD) children. Four preprocessing techniques were applied: no preprocessing (Raw), Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). EEG recordings were segmented, and features were extracted and selected based on statistical significance. Classification was performed using Machine Learning models, as XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors.   Results: The absence of preprocessing leads to artificially high classification accuracy due to noise. In contrast, ASR and ICA preprocessing techniques significantly improved the reliability of results. Segmenting EEG recordings revealed that later segments provided better classification accuracy, likely due to the manifestation of ADHD symptoms over time. The most relevant EEG channels were P3, P4, and C3. The top features for classification included Kurtosis, Katz fractal dimension, and power spectral density of Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands.   Conclusions: Effective preprocessing is essential in EEG-based ADHD diagnosis to prevent noise-induced biases. This study identifies crucial EEG channels and features, providing a foundation for further research and improving ADHD diagnostic accuracy. Future work should focus on expanding datasets, refining preprocessing methods, and enhancing feature interpretability to improve diagnostic accuracy and model robustness for clinical use.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding of video creativity and content often varies among individuals, with differences in focal points and cognitive levels across different ages, experiences, and genders. There is currently a lack of research in this area, and most existing benchmarks suffer from several drawbacks: 1) a limited number of modalities and answers with restrictive length; 2) the content and scenarios within the videos are excessively monotonous, transmitting allegories and emotions that are overly simplistic. To bridge the gap to real-world applications, we introduce a large-scale Subjective Response Indicators for Advertisement Videos dataset, namely SRI-ADV. Specifically, we collected real changes in Electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye-tracking regions from different demographics while they viewed identical video content. Utilizing this multi-modal dataset, we developed tasks and protocols to analyze and evaluate the extent of cognitive understanding of video content among different users. Along with the dataset, we designed a Hypergraph Multi-modal Large Language Model (HMLLM) to explore the associations among different demographics, video elements, EEG, and eye-tracking indicators. HMLLM could bridge semantic gaps across rich modalities and integrate information beyond different modalities to perform logical reasoning. Extensive experimental evaluations on SRI-ADV and other additional video-based generative performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A novel method for decomposing a nonstationary signal into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and discontinuous (jump) components is proposed. Current nonstationary signal decomposition methods are designed to either obtain constituent AM-FM oscillatory modes or the discontinuous and residual components from the data, separately. Yet, many real-world signals of interest simultaneously exhibit both behaviors i.e., jumps and oscillations. Currently, no available method can extract jumps and AM-FM oscillatory components directly from the data. In our novel approach, we design and solve a variational optimization problem to accomplish this task. The optimization formulation includes a regularization term to minimize the bandwidth of all signal modes for effective oscillation modeling, and a prior for extracting the jump component. Our method addresses the limitations of conventional AM-FM signal decomposition methods in extracting jumps, as well as the limitations of existing jump extraction methods in decomposing multiscale oscillations. By employing an optimization framework that accounts for both multiscale oscillatory components and discontinuities, our methods show superior performance compared to existing decomposition techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on synthetic, real-world, single-channel, and multivariate data, highlighting their utility in three specific applications: Earth's electric field signals, electrocardiograms (ECG), and electroencephalograms (EEG).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras. Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion. The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to interact with the external world using brain activity. Despite their potential in neuroscience and industry, BCI performance remains inconsistent in noninvasive applications, often prioritizing algorithms that achieve high classification accuracies while masking the neural mechanisms driving that performance. In this study, we investigated the interpretability of features derived from brain network lateralization, benchmarking against widely used techniques like power spectrum density (PSD), common spatial pattern (CSP), and Riemannian geometry. We focused on the spatial distribution of the functional connectivity within and between hemispheres during motor imagery tasks, introducing network-based metrics such as integration and segregation. Evaluating these metrics across multiple EEG-based BCI datasets, our findings reveal that network lateralization offers neurophysiological plausible insights, characterized by stronger lateralization in sensorimotor and frontal areas contralateral to imagined movements. While these lateralization features did not outperform CSP and Riemannian geometry in terms of classification accuracy, they demonstrated competitive performance against PSD alone and provided biologically relevant interpretation. This study underscores the potential of brain network lateralization as a new feature to be integrated in motor imagery-based BCIs for enhancing the interpretability of noninvasive applications.</td>

To explore the complexity, we introduce the MEEG dataset, a comprehensive multi-modal music-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset and the Attention-based Temporal Learner with Dynamic Graph Neural Network (AT-DGNN), a novel framework for EEG-based emotion recognition. The MEEG dataset captures a wide range of emotional responses to music, enabling an in-depth analysis of brainwave patterns in musical contexts. The AT-DGNN combines an attention-based temporal learner with a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) to accurately model the local and global graph dynamics of EEG data across varying brain network topology. Our evaluations show that AT-DGNN achieves superior performance, with an accuracy (ACC) of 83.06\% in arousal and 85.31\% in valence, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the MEEG dataset. Comparative analyses with traditional datasets like DEAP highlight the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the potential of music as a powerful medium for emotion induction. This study not only advances our understanding of the brain emotional processing, but also enhances the accuracy of emotion recognition technologies in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), leveraging both graph-based learning and the emotional impact of music.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCI) require a lengthy and monotonous training procedure to train both the system and the user. Considering many users struggle with effective control of MI-BCI systems, a more user-centered approach to training might help motivate users and facilitate learning, alleviating inefficiency of the BCI system. With the increase of BCI-controlled games, researchers have suggested using game principles for BCI training, as games are naturally centered on the player. This review identifies and evaluates the application of game design elements to MI-BCI training, a process known as gamification. Through a systematic literature search, we examined how MI-BCI training protocols have been gamified and how specific game elements impacted the training outcomes. We identified 86 studies that employed gamified MI-BCI protocols in the past decade. The prevalence and reported effects of individual game elements on user experience and performance were extracted and synthesized. Results reveal that MI-BCI training protocols are most often gamified by having users move an avatar in a virtual environment that provides visual feedback. Furthermore, in these virtual environments, users were provided with goals that guided their actions. Using gamification, the reviewed protocols allowed users to reach effective MI-BCI control, with studies reporting positive effects of four individual elements on user performance and experience, namely: feedback, avatars, assistance, and social interaction. Based on these elements, this review makes current and future recommendations for effective gamification, such as the use of virtual reality and adaptation of game difficulty to user skill level.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery electroencephalograph (MI-EEG) decoding plays a crucial role in developing motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs). However, decoding intentions from MI remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of EEG signals relative to the small-sample size. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Dual Prototype Network (EDPNet) to enable accurate and fast MI decoding. EDPNet employs a lightweight adaptive spatial-spectral fusion module, which promotes more efficient information fusion between multiple EEG electrodes. Subsequently, a parameter-free multi-scale variance pooling module extracts more comprehensive temporal features. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototypical learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the EDPNet outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy and kappa values (84.11% and 0.7881 for dataset BCI competition IV 2a, 86.65% and 0.7330 for dataset BCI competition IV 2b). Additionally, we use the BCI competition III IVa dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed EDPNet. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our EDPNet shows great potential for MI-BCI applications.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hybrid motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), which integrate both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, outperform those based solely on EEG. However, simultaneously recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules, the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spike sorting is essential for extracting neuronal information from neural signals and understanding brain function. With the advent of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs), the challenges and opportunities in multi-channel spike sorting have intensified. Real-time spike sorting is particularly crucial for closed-loop brain computer interface (BCI) applications, demanding efficient hardware implementations. This paper introduces L-Sort, an hardware design for real-time multi-channel spike sorting. Leveraging spike localization techniques, L-Sort achieves efficient spike detection and clustering without the need to store raw signals during detection. By incorporating median thresholding and geometric features, L-Sort demonstrates promising results in terms of accuracy and hardware efficiency. We assessed the detection and clustering accuracy of our design with publicly available datasets recorded using high-density neural probes (Neuropixel). We implemented our design on an FPGA and compared the results with state of the art. Results show that our designs consume less hardware resource comparing with other FPGA-based spike sorting hardware.</td>

Advances in Brain-Computer Interfaces offer a promising avenue for partially restoring compromised communicative abilities by decoding different types of hand movements from the sensorimotor cortex. In this study, we collected ECoG recordings from 8 epilepsy patients and compared the decodability of individual finger flexion and hand gestures with the resting state, as a proxy for a one-dimensional brain-click. The results show that all individual finger flexion and hand gestures are equally decodable across multiple models and subjects (>98.0\%). In particular, hand movements, involving index finger flexion, emerged as promising candidates for brain-clicks. When decoding among multiple hand movements, finger flexion appears to outperform hand gestures (96.2\% and 92.5\% respectively) and exhibit greater robustness against misclassification errors when all hand movements are included. These findings highlight that optimized classical machine learning models with feature engineering are viable decoder designs for communication-assistive systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding neural activity and information representation is crucial for advancing knowledge of brain function and cognition. Neural activity, measured through techniques like electrophysiology and neuroimaging, reflects various aspects of information processing. Recent advances in deep neural networks offer new approaches to analyzing these signals using pre-trained models. However, challenges arise due to discrepancies between different neural signal modalities and the limited scale of high-quality neural data. To address these challenges, we present NeuroBind, a general representation that unifies multiple brain signal types, including EEG, fMRI, calcium imaging, and spiking data. To achieve this, we align neural signals in these image-paired neural datasets to pre-trained vision-language embeddings. Neurobind is the first model that studies different neural modalities interconnectedly and is able to leverage high-resource modality models for various neuroscience tasks. We also showed that by combining information from different neural signal modalities, NeuroBind enhances downstream performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different neural modalities. As a result, we can leverage multiple types of neural signals mapped to the same space to improve downstream tasks, and demonstrate the complementary strengths of different neural modalities. This approach holds significant potential for advancing neuroscience research, improving AI systems, and developing neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces.</td>

To achieve this goal, we investigate image generation in a time series context. Specifically, we formulate a min-max problem derived from the $f$-divergence between neighboring pairs to learn a time series generator in a nonparametric manner. The generator enables us to generate future images by transforming prior lag-k observations and a random vector from a reference distribution. With a deep neural network learned generator, we prove that the joint distribution of the generated sequence converges to the latent truth under a Markov and a conditional invariance condition. Furthermore, we extend our generation mechanism to a panel data scenario to accommodate multiple samples. The effectiveness of our mechanism is evaluated by generating real brain MRI sequences from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. These generated image sequences can be used as data augmentation to enhance the performance of further downstream tasks, such as Alzheimer's disease detection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is well established that the brain spontaneously traverses through a very large number of states. Nevertheless, despite its relevance to understanding brain function, a formal description of this phenomenon is still lacking. To this end, we introduce a machine learning based method allowing for the determination of the probabilities of all possible states at a given coarse-graining, from which all the thermodynamics can be derived. This is a challenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of the statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear scaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first conjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which ordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes the existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range of brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we observe that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature. The presented approach is not only relevant to brain function but should be applicable for a wide variety of complex systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in object recognition and have been found to share some similarities with brain visual processing. However, the substantial gap between DCNNs and human visual perception still exists. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a widely used technique in cognitive neuroscience can record neural activation in the human visual cortex during the process of visual perception. Can we teach DCNNs human fMRI signals to achieve a more brain-like model? To answer this question, this study proposed ReAlnet-fMRI, a model based on the SOTA vision model CORnet but optimized using human fMRI data through a multi-layer encoding-based alignment framework. This framework has been shown to effectively enable the model to learn human brain representations. The fMRI-optimized ReAlnet-fMRI exhibited higher similarity to the human brain than both CORnet and the control model in within-and across-subject as well as within- and across-modality model-brain (fMRI and EEG) alignment evaluations. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth analyses to investigate how the internal representations of ReAlnet-fMRI differ from CORnet in encoding various object dimensions. These findings provide the possibility of enhancing the brain-likeness of visual models by integrating human neural data, helping to bridge the gap between computer vision and visual neuroscience.</td>

While large language model (LLM)-based fMRI encoding has shown promise, existing studies predominantly focus on healthy, young adults, overlooking older NCD populations and cognitive level correlations. This paper explores language-related functional changes in older NCD adults using LLM-based fMRI encoding and brain scores, addressing current limitations. We analyze the correlation between brain scores and cognitive scores at both whole-brain and language-related ROI levels. Our findings reveal that higher cognitive abilities correspond to better brain scores, with correlations peaking in the middle temporal gyrus. This study highlights the potential of fMRI encoding models and brain scores for detecting early functional changes in NCD patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding that classifies cognitive states using the functional fluctuations of the brain can provide insightful information for understanding the brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. Among the common procedures of decoding the brain cognitive states with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), extracting the time series of each brain region after brain parcellation traditionally averages across the voxels within a brain region. This neglects the spatial information among the voxels and the requirement of extracting information for the downstream tasks. In this study, we propose to use a fully connected neural network that is jointly trained with the brain decoder to perform an adaptively weighted average across the voxels within each brain region. We perform extensive evaluations by cognitive state decoding, manifold learning, and interpretability analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The performance comparison of the cognitive state decoding presents an accuracy increase of up to 5\% and stable accuracy improvement under different time window sizes, resampling sizes, and training data sizes. The results of manifold learning show that our method presents a considerable separability among cognitive states and basically excludes subject-specific information. The interpretability analysis shows that our method can identify reasonable brain regions corresponding to each cognitive state. Our study would aid the improvement of the basic pipeline of fMRI processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In response to the global need for efficient early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), this paper bridges the gap between traditional, time-consuming diagnostic methods and potential automated solutions. We propose a multi-atlas deep ensemble network, MADE-for-ASD, that integrates multiple atlases of the brain's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data through a weighted deep ensemble network. Our approach integrates demographic information into the prediction workflow, which enhances ASD diagnosis performance and offers a more holistic perspective on patient profiling. We experiment with the well-known publicly available ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) I dataset, consisting of resting state fMRI data from 17 different laboratories around the globe. Our proposed system achieves 75.20% accuracy on the entire dataset and 96.40% on a specific subset $-$ both surpassing reported ASD diagnosis accuracy in ABIDE I fMRI studies. Specifically, our model improves by 4.4 percentage points over prior works on the same amount of data. The model exhibits a sensitivity of 82.90% and a specificity of 69.70% on the entire dataset, and 91.00% and 99.50%, respectively, on the specific subset. We leverage the F-score to pinpoint the top 10 ROI in ASD diagnosis, such as \emph{precuneus} and anterior \emph{cingulate/ventromedial}. The proposed system can potentially pave the way for more cost-effective, efficient and scalable strategies in ASD diagnosis. Codes and evaluations are publicly available at TBA.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the transitions between different states of consciousness is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Thus, we investigate the underlying drivers of changes during the resting-state dynamics of the human brain, as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) across varying levels of consciousness (awake, light sedation, deep sedation, and recovery). We deploy a model-based approach relying on linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems under unknown inputs (UI). Our findings reveal distinct changes in the spectral profile of brain dynamics - particularly regarding the stability and frequency of the system's oscillatory modes during transitions between consciousness states. These models further enable us to identify external drivers influencing large-scale brain activity during naturalistic auditory stimulation. Our findings suggest that these identified inputs delineate how stimulus-induced co-activity propagation differs across consciousness states. Notably, our approach showcases the effectiveness of LTI models under UI in capturing large-scale brain dynamic changes and drivers in complex paradigms, such as naturalistic stimulation, which are not conducive to conventional general linear model analysis. Importantly, our findings shed light on how brain-wide dynamics and drivers evolve as the brain transitions towards conscious states, holding promise for developing more accurate biomarkers of consciousness recovery in disorders of consciousness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding cognitive states from functional magnetic resonance imaging is central to understanding the functional organization of the brain. Within-subject decoding avoids between-subject correspondence problems but requires large sample sizes to make accurate predictions; obtaining such large sample sizes is both challenging and expensive. Here, we investigate an ensemble approach to decoding that combines the classifiers trained on data from other subjects to decode cognitive states in a new subject. We compare it with the conventional decoding approach on five different datasets and cognitive tasks. We find that it outperforms the conventional approach by up to 20% in accuracy, especially for datasets with limited per-subject data. The ensemble approach is particularly advantageous when the classifier is trained in voxel space. Furthermore, a Multi-layer Perceptron turns out to be a good default choice as an ensemble method. These results show that the pre-training strategy reduces the need for large per-subject data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we have looked at various variants of the clockwork model and studied their impact on the neutrino masses. Some of the generalizations such as generalized CW and next-to-nearest neighbour interaction CW have already been explored by a few authors. In this study, we studied non-local CW for the fermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\left| q \right| > 1$ constraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Higher-order properties of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) induced connectivity have been shown to unravel many exclusive topological and dynamical insights beyond pairwise interactions. Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A novel paradigm of mobile edge generation (MEG)-enabled digital twin (DT) is proposed, which enables distributed on-device generation at mobile edge networks for real-time DT applications. First, an MEG-DT architecture is put forward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto edge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low latency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying and reconstructing what we see from brain activity gives us a special insight into investigating how the biological visual system represents the world. While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering language from brain activity is a crucial task in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric. This improvement demonstrates the advancement of our model towards real-world applications and underscores its potential in advancing BCI research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Within neuroimgaing studies it is a common practice to perform repetitions of trials in an experiment when working with a noisy class of data acquisition system, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). While this approach can be useful in some experimental designs, it presents significant limitations for certain types of analyses, such as identifying the category of an object observed by a subject. In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels. We do this using two datasets; the Kaneshiro et al. (2015) dataset and the Gifford et al. (2022) dataset. Our results raise doubts about the true generalizability of several published models and suggests that the reported performance of these models may be significantly inflated.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Growing interest and investment in the capabilities of foundation models has positioned such systems to impact a wide array of public services. Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the "foundation" layer, our framework proposes the "subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the "surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate "subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural environment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motivated by the increasing popularity of attention mechanisms, we observe that popular convolutional (conv.) attention models like Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) rely on expensive multi-layer perception (MLP) layers. These MLP layers significantly increase computational complexity, making such models less applicable to 3D image contexts, where data dimensionality and computational costs are higher. In 3D medical imaging, such as 3D pulmonary CT scans, efficient processing is crucial due to the large data volume. Traditional 2D attention generalized to 3D increases the computational load, creating demand for more efficient attention mechanisms for 3D tasks. We investigate the possibility of incorporating fully convolutional (conv.) attention in 3D context. We present two 3D fully conv. attention blocks, demonstrating their effectiveness in 3D context. Using pulmonary CT scans for 3D lung nodule detection, we present AttentNet, an automated lung nodule detection framework from CT images, performing detection as an ensemble of two stages, candidate proposal and false positive (FP) reduction. We compare the proposed 3D attention blocks to popular 2D conv. attention methods generalized to 3D modules and to self-attention units. For the FP reduction stage, we also use a joint analysis approach to aggregate spatial information from different contextual levels. We use LUNA-16 lung nodule detection dataset to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed fully conv. attention blocks compared to baseline popular lung nodule detection methods when no attention is used. Our work does not aim at achieving state-of-the-art results in the lung nodule detection task, rather to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating fully conv. attention within a 3D context.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data sharing in the medical image analysis field has potential yet remains underappreciated. The aim is often to share datasets efficiently with other sites to train models effectively. One possible solution is to avoid transferring the entire dataset while still achieving similar model performance. Recent progress in data distillation within computer science offers promising prospects for sharing medical data efficiently without significantly compromising model effectiveness. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods would be applicable to medical imaging, since medical and natural images are distinct fields. Moreover, it is intriguing to consider what level of performance could be achieved with these methods. To answer these questions, we conduct investigations on a variety of leading data distillation methods, in different contexts of medical imaging. We evaluate the feasibility of these methods with extensive experiments in two aspects: 1) Assess the impact of data distillation across multiple datasets characterized by minor or great variations. 2) Explore the indicator to predict the distillation performance. Our extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets reveal that data distillation can significantly reduce dataset size while maintaining comparable model performance to that achieved with the full dataset, suggesting that a small, representative sample of images can serve as a reliable indicator of distillation success. This study demonstrates that data distillation is a viable method for efficient and secure medical data sharing, with the potential to facilitate enhanced collaborative research and clinical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mammography is crucial for breast cancer surveillance and early diagnosis. However, analyzing mammography images is a demanding task for radiologists, who often review hundreds of mammograms daily, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to assist in this process, but their capabilities, particularly in lesion segmentation, remained limited. With the contemporary advances in deep learning their performance may be improved. Recently, vision-language diffusion models emerged, demonstrating outstanding performance in image generation and transferability to various downstream tasks. We aim to harness their capabilities for breast lesion segmentation in a panoptic setting, which encompasses both semantic and instance-level predictions. Specifically, we propose leveraging pretrained features from a Stable Diffusion model as inputs to a state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation architecture, resulting in accurate delineation of individual breast lesions. To bridge the gap between natural and medical imaging domains, we incorporated a mammography-specific MAM-E diffusion model and BiomedCLIP image and text encoders into this framework. We evaluated our approach on two recently published mammography datasets, CDD-CESM and VinDr-Mammo. For the instance segmentation task, we noted 40.25 AP0.1 and 46.82 AP0.05, as well as 25.44 PQ0.1 and 26.92 PQ0.05. For the semantic segmentation task, we achieved Dice scores of 38.86 and 40.92, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The field of bio-inspired soft grippers has emerged as a transformative area of research with profound implications for biomedical applications. This book chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, developments, challenges, and prospects of soft grippers that draw inspiration from biological systems. Bio-inspired soft grippers have gained prominence due to their unique characteristics, including compliance, adaptability, and biocompatibility. They have revolutionized the way we approach biomedical tasks, offering safer interactions with delicate tissues and enabling complex operations that were once inconceivable with rigid tools. The chapter delves into the fundamental importance of soft grippers in biomedical contexts. It outlines their significance in surgeries, diagnostics, tissue engineering, and various medical interventions. Soft grippers have the capacity to mimic the intricate movements of biological organisms, facilitating minimally invasive procedures and enhancing patient outcomes. A historical perspective traces the evolution of soft grippers in biomedical research, highlighting key milestones and breakthroughs. From early attempts to emulate the dexterity of octopus tentacles to the latest advancements in soft lithography and biomaterials, the journey has been marked by ingenuity and collaboration across multiple disciplines. Motivations for adopting soft grippers in biomedical applications are explored, emphasizing their ability to reduce invasiveness, increase precision, and provide adaptability to complex anatomical structures. The requirements and challenges in designing grippers fit for medical contexts are outlined, encompassing biocompatibility, sterilization, control, and integration.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Joint models have proven to be an effective approach for uncovering potentially hidden connections between various types of outcomes, mainly continuous, time-to-event, and binary. Typically, longitudinal continuous outcomes are characterized by linear mixed-effects models, survival outcomes are described by proportional hazards models, and the link between outcomes are captured by shared random effects. Other modeling variations include generalized linear mixed-effects models for longitudinal data and logistic regression when a binary outcome is present, rather than time until an event of interest. However, in a clinical research setting, one might be interested in modeling the physician's chosen treatment based on the patient's medical history in order to identify prognostic factors. In this situation, there are often multiple treatment options, requiring the use of a multiclass classification approach. Inspired by this context, we develop a Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and categorical data. In particular, our motivation comes from a multiple myeloma study, in which biomarkers display nonlinear trajectories that are well captured through bi-exponential submodels, where patient-level information is shared with the categorical submodel. We also present a variable importance strategy for ranking prognostic factors. We apply our proposal and a competing model to the multiple myeloma data, compare the variable importance and inferential results for both models, and illustrate patient-level interpretations using our joint model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Volumetric neuroimaging examinations like structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) are routinely applied to support the clinical diagnosis of dementia like Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Neuroradiologists examine 3D sMRI to detect and monitor abnormalities in brain morphology due to AD, like global and/or local brain atrophy and shape alteration of characteristic structures. There is a strong research interest in developing diagnostic systems based on Deep Learning (DL) models to analyse sMRI for AD. However, anatomical information extracted from an sMRI examination needs to be interpreted together with patient's age to distinguish AD patterns from the regular alteration due to a normal ageing process. In this context, part-prototype neural networks integrate the computational advantages of DL in an interpretable-by-design architecture and showed promising results in medical imaging applications. We present PIMPNet, the first interpretable multimodal model for 3D images and demographics applied to the binary classification of AD from 3D sMRI and patient's age. Despite age prototypes do not improve predictive performance compared to the single modality model, this lays the foundation for future work in the direction of the model's design and multimodal prototype training process</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of vision impairment. Digital imaging techniques, such as color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), provide quantitative and noninvasive methods for glaucoma diagnosis. Recently, in the field of computer-aided glaucoma diagnosis, multi-modality methods that integrate the CFP and OCT modalities have achieved greater diagnostic accuracy compared to single-modality methods. However, it remains challenging to extract reliable features due to the high similarity of medical images and the unbalanced multi-modal data distribution. Moreover, existing methods overlook the uncertainty estimation of different modalities, leading to unreliable predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, namely ETSCL, which consists of a contrastive feature extraction stage and a decision-level fusion stage. Specifically, the supervised contrastive loss is employed to enhance the discriminative power in the feature extraction process, resulting in more effective features. In addition, we utilize the Frangi vesselness algorithm as a preprocessing step to incorporate vessel information to assist in the prediction. In the decision-level fusion stage, an evidence theory-based multi-modality classifier is employed to combine multi-source information with uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/master-Shix/ETSCL}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Stroke is second-leading cause of disability and death among adults. Approximately 17 million people suffer from a stroke annually, with about 85% being ischemic strokes. Predicting mortality of ischemic stroke patients in intensive care unit (ICU) is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies, allocating resources, and improving survival rates. Methods: We acquired data on ICU ischemic stroke patients from MIMIC-IV database, including diagnoses, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, procedures, treatments, and clinical notes. Stroke patients were randomly divided into training (70%, n=2441), test (15%, n=523), and validation (15%, n=523) sets. To address data imbalances, we applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). We selected 30 features for model development, significantly reducing feature number from 1095 used in the best study. We developed a deep learning model to assess mortality risk and implemented several baseline machine learning models for comparison. Results: XGB-DL model, combining XGBoost for feature selection and deep learning, effectively minimized false positives. Model AUROC improved from 0.865 (95% CI: 0.821 - 0.905) on first day to 0.903 (95% CI: 0.868 - 0.936) by fourth day using data from 3,646 ICU mortality patients in the MIMIC-IV database with 0.945 AUROC (95% CI: 0.944 - 0.947) during training. Although other ML models also performed well in terms of AUROC, we chose Deep Learning for its higher specificity. Conclusions: Through enhanced feature selection and data cleaning, proposed model demonstrates a 13% AUROC improvement compared to existing models while reducing feature number from 1095 in previous studies to 30.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the realm of medical image fusion, integrating information from various modalities is crucial for improving diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in retinal health, where the important features exhibit differently in different imaging modalities. Existing deep learning-based approaches insufficiently focus on retinal image fusion, and thus fail to preserve enough anatomical structure and fine vessel details in retinal image fusion. To address this, we propose the Topology-Aware Graph Attention Network (TaGAT) for multi-modal retinal image fusion, leveraging a novel Topology-Aware Encoder (TAE) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to effectively enhance spatial features with retinal vasculature's graph topology across modalities. The TAE encodes the base and detail features, extracted via a Long-short Range (LSR) encoder from retinal images, into the graph extracted from the retinal vessel. Within the TAE, the GAT-based Graph Information Update (GIU) block dynamically refines and aggregates the node features to generate topology-aware graph features. The updated graph features with base and detail features are combined and decoded as a fused image. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Fluorescein Fundus Angiography (FFA) with Color Fundus (CF) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with confocal microscopy retinal image fusion.
