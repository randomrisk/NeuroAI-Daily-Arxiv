<td style='padding: 4px;'>Whole-slide multiplex imaging of brain tissue generates massive information-dense images that are challenging to analyze and require custom software. We present an alternative query-driven programming-free strategy using a multiplex visual search engine (mViSE) that learns the multifaceted brain tissue chemoarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and myeloarchitecture. Our divide-and-conquer strategy organizes the data into panels of related molecular markers and uses self-supervised learning to train a multiplex encoder for each panel with explicit visual confirmation of successful learning. Multiple panels can be combined to process visual queries for retrieving similar communities of individual cells or multicellular niches using information-theoretic methods. The retrievals can be used for diverse purposes including tissue exploration, delineating brain regions and cortical cell layers, profiling and comparing brain regions without computer programming. We validated mViSE's ability to retrieve single cells, proximal cell pairs, tissue patches, delineate cortical layers, brain regions and sub-regions. mViSE is provided as an open-source QuPath plug-in.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking neural networks (SNNs), regarded as the third generation of artificial neural networks, are expected to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. However, most mainstream SNN research directly adopts the rigid, chain-like hierarchical architecture of traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), ignoring key structural characteristics of the brain. Biological neurons are stochastically interconnected, forming complex neural pathways that exhibit Neuron-Expandability, Pathway-Reusability, and Dynamic-Configurability. In this paper, we introduce a new SNN paradigm, named Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN), by incorporating Random Graph Architecture (RGA). Furthermore, we address the issues of network degradation and dimensional mismatch in deep pathways by introducing an improved pure spiking residual mechanism alongside an adaptive pooling strategy. Then, we design a Key Pathway-based Learning without Forgetting (KP-LwF) approach, which selectively reuses critical neural pathways while retaining historical knowledge, enabling efficient multi-task transfer. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Growth Learning (DGL) algorithm that allows neurons and synapses to grow dynamically along the internal temporal dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogniSNN achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, current state-of-the-art SNNs on neuromorphic datasets and Tiny-ImageNet. The Pathway-Reusability enhances the network's continuous learning capability across different scenarios, while the dynamic growth algorithm improves robustness against interference and mitigates the fixed-timestep constraints during neuromorphic chip deployment. This work demonstrates the potential of SNNs with random graph structures in advancing brain-inspired intelligence and lays the foundation for their practical application on neuromorphic hardware.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal MRI offers complementary multi-scale information to characterize the brain structure. However, it remains challenging to effectively integrate multimodal MRI while achieving neuroscience interpretability. Here we propose to use Laplacian harmonics and spectral graph theory for multimodal alignment and multiscale integration. Based on the cortical mesh and connectome matrix that offer multi-scale representations, we devise Laplacian operators and spectral graph attentions to construct a shared latent space for model alignment. Next, we employ a disentangled learning combined with Graph Variational Autoencoder architectures to separate scale-specific and shared features. Lastly, we design a mutual information-informed bilevel regularizer to separate causal and non-causal factors based on the disentangled features, achieving robust model performance with enhanced interpretability. Our model outperforms baselines and other state-of-the-art models. The ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Our model promises to offer a robust and interpretable framework for multi-scale brain structure analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spatial transcriptomics technologies enable the measurement of gene expression with spatial context, providing opportunities to understand how gene regulatory networks vary across tissue regions. However, existing graphical models focus primarily on undirected graphs or directed acyclic graphs, limiting their ability to capture feedback loops that are prevalent in gene regulation. Moreover, ensuring the so-called stability condition of cyclic graphs, while allowing graph structures to vary continuously with spatial covariates, presents significant statistical and computational challenges. We propose BNP-DCGx, a Bayesian nonparametric approach for learning spatially varying gene regulatory networks via covariate-dependent directed cyclic graphical models. Our method introduces a covariate-dependent random partition as an intermediary layer in a hierarchical model, which discretizes the covariate space into clusters with cluster-specific stable directed cyclic graphs. Through partition averaging, we obtain smoothly varying graph structures over space while maintaining theoretical guarantees of stability. We develop an efficient parallel tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference and demonstrate through simulations that our method accurately recovers both piecewise constant and continuously varying graph structures. Application to spatial transcriptomics data from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reveals spatially varying regulatory networks with feedback loops, identifies potential cell subtypes within established cell types based on distinct regulatory mechanisms, and provides new insights into spatial organization of gene regulation in brain tissue.</td>

This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI. Code will be public at {https://github.com/m-dannecker/Gaussian-Primitives-for-Fast-SVR}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The development of foundation models for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series holds significant promise for predicting phenotypes related to disease and cognition. Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Introduction: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the central nervous system but prevents most neurotherapeutics from reaching effective concentrations in the brain. BBB-penetrating peptides (BBBPs) offer a promising strategy for brain drug delivery; however, the scarcity of positive samples and severe class imbalance hinder the reliable identification of BBBPs.   Objectives: Our goal is to alleviate class imbalance in BBBP prediction and to develop an accurate, interpretable classifier for BBBP prediction.   Methods: We propose DREAM-B3P, which couples a feedback diffusion model (FB-Diffusion) for data augmentation with a dual-stream Transformer for classification. FB-Diffusion learns the BBBP distribution via iterative denoising and uses an external analyzer to provide feedback, generating high-quality pseudo-BBBPs. The classifier contains a sequence stream that extracts structural features from peptide sequences and a physicochemical stream that captures physicochemical features such as hydrophobic surface area, molecular charge, number of rotatable bonds, and polarizability. Combining the two features leads to superior BBBP predictive performance.   Results: On a benchmark test set containing equal numbers of BBBPs and non-BBBPs, DREAM-B3P surpasses baseline methods (Deep-B3P, B3Pred, BBPpredict and Augur), improving AUC/ACC/MCC by 4.3\%/17.8\%/14.9\%, respectively, over the second-best method.   Conclusion: By integrating feedback diffusion with a dual-stream Transformer classifier, DREAM-B3P effectively mitigates data scarcity and imbalance and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MR experiments are essential for studying brain metabolism, yet preclinical 1H-MRSI remains underdeveloped, with significant limitations in SNR, acquisition speed, and automated data processing. Although recent advances-such as accelerated sequences, denoising strategies, and ultra-high-field systems-have begun to reduce these barriers, preclinical MRSI still lags far behind the human research field in accessibility and routine use. Based on our expertise, we have created this guide that outlines a complete workflow for acquiring and analyzing high-quality fast MRSI data in rodent brains at ultra-high fields (9.4T and 14.1T), enabling novice users to perform reliable experiments using optimized MRSI sequences (FID-MRSI, SE-MRSI, and PRESS-MRSI) and standardized processing pipelines, while also highlighting strategies to further improve acquisition speed, coverage, and reproducibility. Overall, this paper provides a strong foundation for future methodological advances that will expand metabolic imaging capabilities and deepen insights into brain function and disease.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While penetration testing plays a vital role in cybersecurity, achieving fully automated, hands-off-the-keyboard execution remains a significant research challenge. In this paper, we introduce the "Planner-Executor-Perceptor (PEP)" design paradigm and use it to systematically review existing work and identify the key challenges in this area. We also evaluate existing penetration testing systems, with a particular focus on the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task. The results show that the out-of-the-box Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5 exhibit superior penetration capabilities observed to date, substantially outperforming all prior systems. However, a detailed analysis of their testing processes reveals specific strengths and limitations; notably, LLM agents struggle with maintaining coherent long-horizon plans, performing complex reasoning, and effectively utilizing specialized tools. These limitations significantly constrain its overall capability, efficiency, and stability. To address these limitations, we propose CHECKMATE, a framework that integrates enhanced classical planning with LLM agents, providing an external, structured "brain" that mitigates the inherent weaknesses of LLM agents. Our evaluation shows that CHECKMATE outperforms the state-of-the-art system (Claude Code) in penetration capability, improving benchmark success rates by over 20%. In addition, it delivers substantially greater stability, cutting both time and monetary costs by more than 50%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We develop here a stochastic framework for modeling and segmenting transient spindle-like oscillatory bursts in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. At the modeling level, individual spindles are represented as path realizations of a two-dimensional Ornstein{Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a stable focus, providing a low-dimensional stochastic dynamical system whose trajectories reproduce key morphological features of spindles, including their characteristic rise{decay amplitude envelopes. On the signal processing side, we propose a segmentation procedure based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with the detection of a central extremum, which isolates single spindle events and yields a collection of oscillatory atoms. This construction enables a systematic statistical analysis of spindle features: we derive empirical laws for the distributions of amplitudes, inter-spindle intervals, and rise/decay durations, and show that these exhibit exponential tails consistent with the underlying OU dynamics. We further extend the model to a pair of weakly coupled OU processes with distinct natural frequencies, generating a stochastic mixture of slow, fast, and mixed spindles in random temporal order. The resulting framework provides a data-driven framework for the analysis of transient oscillations in EEG and, more generally, in nonstationary time series.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Most real-world networks exhibit a significant degree of modularity. Understanding the effects of such topology on dynamical processes is pivotal for advances in social and natural sciences. In this work we consider the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators on modular networks and propose a simple coarse-graining procedure where modules are replaced by effective single oscillators. The method is inspired by EEG measurements, where very large groups of neurons under each electrode are interpreted as single nodes in a correlation network. We expose the interplay between intra-module and inter-module coupling strengths in keeping the coarse-graining process meaningful and show that its accuracy depends on the degree of intra-module synchronization. We show that, when modules are well synchronized, the phase transition from asynchronous to synchronous motion in networks with 2 and 3 modules is very well described by their respective reduced systems, regardless of the network structure connecting the modules. Application of the method to real networks with small modularity coefficients, on the other hand, reveals that the approximation is not accurate, although it still allows for the computation of the critical coupling and the qualitative behavior of the order parameter if the inter-module coupling is large enough.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how driver mental states differ between active and autonomous driving is critical for designing safe human-vehicle interfaces. This paper presents the first EEG-based comparison of cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal across the two driving modes. Using data from 31 participants performing identical tasks in both scenarios of three different complexity levels, we analyze temporal patterns, task-complexity effects, and channel-wise activation differences. Our findings show that although both modes evoke similar trends across complexity levels, the intensity of mental states and the underlying neural activation differ substantially, indicating a clear distribution shift between active and autonomous driving. Transfer-learning experiments confirm that models trained on active driving data generalize poorly to autonomous driving and vice versa. We attribute this distribution shift primarily to differences in motor engagement and attentional demands between the two driving modes, which lead to distinct spatial and temporal EEG activation patterns. Although autonomous driving results in lower overall cortical activation, participants continue to exhibit measurable fluctuations in cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal associated with readiness to intervene, task-evoked emotional responses, and monotony-related passive fatigue. These results emphasize the need for scenario-specific data and models when developing next-generation driver monitoring systems for autonomous vehicles.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Real-time adjustments to task difficulty during flight training are crucial for optimizing performance and managing pilot workload. This study evaluated the functionality of a pre-trained brain-computer interface (BCI) that adapts training difficulty based on real-time estimations of workload from brain signals. Specifically, an EEG-based neuro-adaptive training system was developed and tested in Virtual Reality (VR) flight simulations with military student pilots. The neuro-adaptive system was compared to a fixed sequence that progressively increased in difficulty, in terms of self-reported user engagement, workload, and simulator sickness (subjective measures), as well as flight performance (objective metric). Additionally, we explored the relationships between subjective workload and flight performance in the VR simulator for each condition. The experiments concluded with semi-structured interviews to elicit the pilots' experience with the neuro-adaptive prototype. Results revealed no significant differences between the adaptive and fixed sequence conditions in subjective measures or flight performance. In both conditions, flight performance decreased as subjective workload increased. The semi-structured interviews indicated that, upon briefing, the pilots preferred the neuro-adaptive VR training system over the system with a fixed sequence, although individual differences were observed in the perception of difficulty and the order of changes in difficulty. Even though this study shows performance does not change, BCI-based flight training systems hold the potential to provide a more personalized and varied training experience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a novel graph-based learning of EEG representations with gradient alignment (GEEGA) that leverages multi-domain information to learn EEG representations for brain-computer interfaces. Our model leverages graph convolutional networks to fuse embeddings from frequency-based topographical maps and time-frequency spectrograms, capturing inter-domain relationships. GEEGA addresses the challenge of achieving high inter-class separability, which arises from the temporally dynamic and subject-sensitive nature of EEG signals by incorporating the center loss and pairwise difference loss. Additionally, GEEGA incorporates a gradient alignment strategy to resolve conflicts between gradients from different domains and the fused embeddings, ensuring that discrepancies, where gradients point in conflicting directions, are aligned toward a unified optimization direction. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on three publicly available EEG datasets: BCI-2a, CL-Drive and CLARE. Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the impact of various components of our model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Patients with motor dysfunction show low subjective engagement in rehabilitation training. Traditional SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems rely heavily on external visual stimulus equipment, limiting their practicality in real-world settings. This study proposes an augmented reality steady-state visually evoked potential (AR-SSVEP) system to address the lack of patient initiative and the high workload on therapists. Firstly, we design four HoloLens 2-based EEG classes and collect EEG data from seven healthy subjects for analysis. Secondly, we build upon the conventional CNN-BiLSTM architecture by integrating a multi-head attention mechanism (MACNN-BiLSTM). We extract ten temporal-spectral EEG features and feed them into a CNN to learn high-level representations. Then, we use BiLSTM to model sequential dependencies and apply a multi-head attention mechanism to highlight motor-intention-related patterns. Finally, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is applied to visualize EEG feature contributions to the neural network's decision-making process, enhancing the model's interpretability. These findings enhance real-time motor intention recognition and support recovery in patients with motor impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a novel approach to EEG decoding for non-invasive brain machine interfaces (BMIs), with a focus on motor-behavior classification. While conventional convolutional architectures such as EEGNet and DeepConvNet are effective in capturing local spatial patterns, they are markedly less suited for modeling long-range temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. To address this limitation, we integrate an Echo State Network (ESN), a prominent paradigm in reservoir computing into the decoding pipeline. ESNs construct a high-dimensional, sparsely connected recurrent reservoir that excels at tracking temporal dynamics, thereby complementing the spatial representational power of CNNs. Evaluated on a skateboard-trick EEG dataset preprocessed via the PREP pipeline and implemented in MNE-Python, our ESNNet achieves 83.2% within-subject and 51.3% LOSO accuracies, surpassing widely used CNN-based baselines.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding. Our code and scripts are available at https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/NeuroSketch.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Real-time adjustments to task difficulty during flight training are crucial for optimizing performance and managing pilot workload. This study evaluated the functionality of a pre-trained brain-computer interface (BCI) that adapts training difficulty based on real-time estimations of workload from brain signals. Specifically, an EEG-based neuro-adaptive training system was developed and tested in Virtual Reality (VR) flight simulations with military student pilots. The neuro-adaptive system was compared to a fixed sequence that progressively increased in difficulty, in terms of self-reported user engagement, workload, and simulator sickness (subjective measures), as well as flight performance (objective metric). Additionally, we explored the relationships between subjective workload and flight performance in the VR simulator for each condition. The experiments concluded with semi-structured interviews to elicit the pilots' experience with the neuro-adaptive prototype. Results revealed no significant differences between the adaptive and fixed sequence conditions in subjective measures or flight performance. In both conditions, flight performance decreased as subjective workload increased. The semi-structured interviews indicated that, upon briefing, the pilots preferred the neuro-adaptive VR training system over the system with a fixed sequence, although individual differences were observed in the perception of difficulty and the order of changes in difficulty. Even though this study shows performance does not change, BCI-based flight training systems hold the potential to provide a more personalized and varied training experience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Speech Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer promising solutions to people with severe paralysis unable to communicate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Robust decoding and classification of brain patterns measured with electroencephalography (EEG) remains a major challenge for real-world (i.e. outside scientific lab and medical facilities) brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to well documented inter- and intra-participant variability. Here, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluating over 340,000+ unique combinations of spatial and nonlinear EEG classification. Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets. Future work will require adaptive, multimodal, and possibly novel approaches to fully address neurophysiological variability in practical BCI applications where the system can automatically adapt to what makes each user unique.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Motor Execution (ME) and Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals offer a direct pathway for human-machine interaction. However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance. Evaluated on three public datasets of varying complexity (EEGmmidb-BCI2000, BCI-IV 2a, and M3CV), GCMCG achieves overall accuracies of 86.60%, 98.57%, and 99.61%, respectively, which demonstrates its superior effectiveness and strong generalization capability for practical BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motivated by the Cybathlon 2024 competition, we developed a modular, online EEG-based brain-computer interface to address these challenges, increasing accessibility for individuals with severe mobility impairments. Our system uses three mental and motor imagery classes to control up to five control signals. The pipeline consists of four modules: data acquisition, preprocessing, classification, and the transfer function to map classification output to control dimensions. We use three diagonalized structured state-space sequence layers as a deep learning classifier. We developed a training game for our pilot where the mental tasks control the game during quick-time events. We implemented a mobile web application for live user feedback. The components were designed with a human-centred approach in collaboration with the tetraplegic user. We achieve up to 84% classification accuracy in offline analysis using an S4D-layer-based model. In a competition setting, our pilot successfully completed one task; we attribute the reduced performance in this context primarily to factors such as stress and the challenging competition environment. Following the Cybathlon, we further validated our pipeline with the original pilot and an additional participant, achieving a success rate of 73% in real-time gameplay. We also compare our model to the EEGEncoder, which is slower in training but has a higher performance. The S4D model outperforms the reference machine learning models. We provide insights into developing a framework for portable BCIs, bridging the gap between the laboratory and daily life. Specifically, our framework integrates modular design, real-time data processing, user-centred feedback, and low-cost hardware to deliver an accessible and adaptable BCI solution, addressing critical gaps in current BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The development of foundation models for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series holds significant promise for predicting phenotypes related to disease and cognition. Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly under domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning models often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Medical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts, and in which brain regions these representations are encoded, remains a long-standing challenge. Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.</td>

This paper presents a novel framework integrating transformer-based architectures with multimodal inputs, including fMRI data and DICOM metadata. By employing attention mechanisms, the proposed method captures intricate spatial-temporal patterns and contextual relationships, enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. The potential of this framework spans applications in clinical diagnostics, cognitive neuroscience, and personalized medicine. Limitations, such as metadata variability and computational demands, are addressed, and future directions for optimizing scalability and generalizability are discussed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and acute ischemic stroke are life-threatening conditions involving complex interactions across cortical, brainstem, and autonomic systems. We present a unified geometric-stochastic multimodal deep learning framework that integrates EEG, ECG, respiration, SpO2, EMG, and fMRI signals to model SUDEP and stroke vulnerability. The approach combines Riemannian manifold embeddings, Lie-group invariant feature representations, fractional stochastic dynamics, Hamiltonian energy-flow modeling, and cross-modal attention mechanisms. Stroke propagation is modeled using fractional epidemic diffusion over structural brain graphs. Experiments on the MULTI-CLARID dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and interpretable biomarkers derived from manifold curvature, fractional memory indices, attention entropy, and diffusion centrality. The proposed framework provides a mathematically principled foundation for early detection, risk stratification, and interpretable multimodal modeling in neural-autonomic disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Regression analysis for responses taking values in general metric spaces has received increasing attention, particularly for settings with Euclidean predictors $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and non-Euclidean responses $Y$ in metric spaces. While additive regression is a powerful tool for enhancing interpretability and mitigating the curse of dimensionality in the presence of multivariate predictors, its direct extension is hindered by the absence of vector space operations in general metric spaces. We propose a novel framework for additive optimal transport regression, which incorporates additive structure through optimal geodesic transports. A key idea is to extend the notion of optimal transports in Wasserstein spaces to general geodesic metric spaces. This unified approach accommodates a wide range of responses, including probability distributions, symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices with various metrics and spherical data. The practical utility of the method is illustrated with correlation matrices derived from resting state fMRI brain imaging data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human visual system exhibits non-uniform spatial resolution across the visual field, which is characterized by the cortical magnification factor (CMF) that reflects its anatomical basis. However, current approaches for quantifying CMF using retinotopic maps derived from BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are limited by the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data and inaccuracies in the topological relationships of the retinotopic maps. In this study, we introduced a new pipeline to quantify planar CMF from retinotopic maps generated from the population receptive field (pRF) model. The pipeline projected the 3D pRF solutions onto a 2D planar disk, using optimal transport (OT) to preserve local cortical surface areas, and applied topological smoothing to ensure that the resulting retinotopic maps maintain their topology. We then estimated 2D CMF maps from the projected retinotopic maps on the planar disk using the 1-ring patch method. Applying this pipeline to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7T dataset, we revealed previously unobserved CMF patterns across the visual field and demonstrated individual differences among the 181 subjects. The pipeline was further validated on the New York University (NYU) 3T dataset, showing reliable and repeatable results. Our study provided new analytical methods and offered novel insights into visual processing.</td>

Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail.

We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional connectivity (FC) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data offers vital insights for understanding brain function and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Unsupervised clustering methods are desired to group individuals based on shared features, facilitating clinical diagnosis. In this study, a parsimonious clustering model is proposed, which integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and covariance regression framework, to cluster individuals based on FC captured by data covariance matrices in resting-state fMRI studies. The model assumes common linear projections across covariance matrices and a generalized linear model with covariates, allowing for flexible yet interpretable projection-specific clustering solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess clustering accuracy and robustness. The approach is applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Subgroups are identified based on brain coherence and simultaneously uncover the association with demographic factors and cognitive functions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Studying learning-related plasticity is central to understanding the acquisition of complex skills, for example learning to master a musical instrument. Over the past three decades, conventional group-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have advanced our understanding of how humans' neural representations change during skill acquisition. However, group-based fMRI studies average across heterogeneous learners and often rely on coarse pre- versus post-training comparisons, limiting the spatial and temporal precision with which neural changes can be estimated. Here, we outline an individual-specific precision approach that tracks neural changes within individuals by collecting high-quality neuroimaging data frequently over the course of training, mapping brain function in each person's own anatomical space, and gathering detailed behavioral measures of learning, allowing neural trajectories to be directly linked to individual learning progress. Complementing fMRI with mobile neuroimaging methods, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), will enable researchers to track plasticity during naturalistic practice and across extended time scales. This multi-modal approach will enhance sensitivity to individual learning trajectories and will offer more nuanced insights into how neural representations change with training. We also discuss how findings can be generalized beyond individuals, including through statistical methods based on replication in additional individuals. Together, this approach allows researchers to design highly informative longitudinal training studies that advance a mechanistic, personalized account of skill learning in the human brain.</td>

Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a Standard Model (SM) extension where neutrinos get masses through a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism. This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(μ\to e γ)\simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $μ\to eee$ and $μ$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach. Altogether, the radiative origin of neutrino masses links low-energy flavor observables to collider signatures, delineating discovery targets for MEG II, Mu2e/COMET, and the HL-LHC and distinguishing this framework from conventional inverse- and radiative-seesaw models. Moreover, the $Z_3$ guarantees a stable DM candidate, either scalar ($ρ$) or fermionic ($Ω$). Then, here we analyze and identify the viable parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic abundance for both situations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding imagined speech engages complex neural processes that are difficult to interpret due to uncertainty in timing and the limited availability of imagined-response datasets. In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We revisit the minimal type II seesaw mechanism generating the Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M^ν$, under the assumption that two entries of $M^ν$ vanish. Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^ν$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $μ\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $τ\to \barμee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^ν$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $τ$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces variational representational similarity analysis RSA (vRSA) for electromagnetic recordings of neural responses (e.g., EEG, MEG, ECoG or LFP). Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context, peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked example using openly available EEG data. Software functions implementing vRSA for the SPM software package accompany this paper, together with exemplar analysis scripts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Coordinate-based neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for representing continuous physical fields, yet they face two fundamental pathologies: spectral bias, which hinders the learning of high-frequency dynamics, and the curse of dimensionality, which causes parameter explosion in discrete feature grids. We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations. This work establishes a new paradigm for memory-efficient, spectrally accurate scientific machine learning. The code is available at https://github.com/VladimerKhasia/vecua.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Therapeutic decision-making in clinical medicine constitutes a high-stakes domain in which AI guidance interacts with complex interactions among patient characteristics, disease processes, and pharmacological agents. Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI. Code will be public at {https://github.com/m-dannecker/Gaussian-Primitives-for-Fast-SVR}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.</td>

To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.</td>

We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MR experiments are essential for studying brain metabolism, yet preclinical 1H-MRSI remains underdeveloped, with significant limitations in SNR, acquisition speed, and automated data processing. Although recent advances-such as accelerated sequences, denoising strategies, and ultra-high-field systems-have begun to reduce these barriers, preclinical MRSI still lags far behind the human research field in accessibility and routine use. Based on our expertise, we have created this guide that outlines a complete workflow for acquiring and analyzing high-quality fast MRSI data in rodent brains at ultra-high fields (9.4T and 14.1T), enabling novice users to perform reliable experiments using optimized MRSI sequences (FID-MRSI, SE-MRSI, and PRESS-MRSI) and standardized processing pipelines, while also highlighting strategies to further improve acquisition speed, coverage, and reproducibility. Overall, this paper provides a strong foundation for future methodological advances that will expand metabolic imaging capabilities and deepen insights into brain function and disease.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Integrating language models (LMs) in healthcare systems holds great promise for improving medical workflows and decision-making. However, a critical barrier to their real-world adoption is the lack of reliable evaluation of their trustworthiness, especially in multilingual healthcare settings. Existing LMs are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, making them ill-equipped to handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages, posing significant challenges for deploying them in global healthcare contexts where linguistic diversity is key. In this work, we present CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark to evaluate the trustworthiness of language models in healthcare. CLINIC systematically benchmarks LMs across five key dimensions of trustworthiness: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy, operationalized through 18 diverse tasks, spanning 15 languages (covering all the major continents), and encompassing a wide array of critical healthcare topics like disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Our extensive evaluation reveals that LMs struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By highlighting these shortcomings, CLINIC lays the foundation for enhancing the global reach and safety of LMs in healthcare across diverse languages.</td>
