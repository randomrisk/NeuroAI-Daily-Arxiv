<td style='padding: 4px;'>Perfusion MRI (pMRI) offers valuable insights into tumor vascularity and promises to predict tumor genotypes, thus benefiting prognosis for glioma patients, yet effective models tailored to 4D pMRI are still lacking. This study presents the first attempt to model 4D pMRI using a GNN-based spatiotemporal model PerfGAT, integrating spatial information and temporal kinetics to predict Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status in glioma patients. Specifically, we propose a graph structure learning approach based on edge attention and negative graphs to optimize temporal correlations modeling. Moreover, we design a dual-attention feature fusion module to integrate spatiotemporal features while addressing tumor-related brain regions. Further, we develop a class-balanced augmentation methods tailored to spatiotemporal data, which could mitigate the common label imbalance issue in clinical datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, promising to model pMRI effectively for patient characterization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Navigating through a physical environment to reach a desired location involves a complex interplay of cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. When navigating with others, experiencing a degree of behavioral and cognitive synchronization is both natural and ubiquitous. This synchronization facilitates a harmonious effort toward achieving a common goal, reflecting how individuals instinctively align their actions and thoughts in collaborative settings. Collaborative spatial tasks, which are crucial in daily and professional settings, require coordinated navigation and problem-solving skills. This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying such tasks by using hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG) technology to examine brain dynamics in dyadic route planning within a virtual reality setting. By analyzing intra- and inter-brain couplings across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma EEG bands using both functional and effective connectivity measures, we identified significant neural synchronization patterns associated with collaborative task performance in both leaders and followers. Functional intra-brain connectivity analyses revealed distinct neural engagement across EEG frequency bands, with increased delta couplings observed in both leaders and followers. Theta connectivity was particularly enhanced in followers, whereas the alpha band exhibited divergent patterns that indicate role-specific neural strategies. Inter-brain analysis revealed increased delta causality between interacting members but decreased theta and gamma couplings from followers to leaders. Additionally, inter-brain analysis indicated decreased couplings in faster-performing dyads, especially in theta bands. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms driving collaborative spatial navigation and demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperscanning in studying complex brain-to-brain interactions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted great research attention owing to their inherent bio-interpretability, event-triggered properties and powerful perception of spatiotemporal information, which is beneficial to handling event-based neuromorphic datasets. In contrast to conventional static image datasets, event-based neuromorphic datasets present heightened complexity in feature extraction due to their distinctive time series and sparsity characteristics, which influences their classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, a novel approach termed Neuromorphic Momentum Contrast Learning (NeuroMoCo) for SNNs is introduced in this paper by extending the benefits of self-supervised pre-training to SNNs to effectively stimulate their potential. This is the first time that self-supervised learning (SSL) based on momentum contrastive learning is realized in SNNs. In addition, we devise a novel loss function named MixInfoNCE tailored to their temporal characteristics to further increase the classification accuracy of neuromorphic datasets, which is verified through rigorous ablation experiments. Finally, experiments on DVS-CIFAR10, DVS128Gesture and N-Caltech101 have shown that NeuroMoCo of this paper establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks: 83.6% (Spikformer-2-256), 98.62% (Spikformer-2-256), and 84.4% (SEW-ResNet-18), respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spatial cognition empowers animals with remarkably efficient navigation abilities, largely depending on the scene-level understanding of spatial environments. Recently, it has been found that a neural population in the postrhinal cortex of rat brains is more strongly tuned to the spatial layout rather than objects in a scene. Inspired by the representations of spatial layout in local scenes to encode different regions separately, we proposed LOP-Field that realizes the Layout-Object-Position(LOP) association to model the hierarchical representations for robotic scene understanding. Powered by foundation models and implicit scene representation, a neural field is implemented as a scene memory for robots, storing a queryable representation of scenes with position-wise, object-wise, and layout-wise information. To validate the built LOP association, the model is tested to infer region information from 3D positions with quantitative metrics, achieving an average accuracy of more than 88\%. It is also shown that the proposed method using region information can achieve improved object and view localization results with text and RGB input compared to state-of-the-art localization methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain's complex functionality emerges from network interactions that go beyond dyadic connections, with higher-order interactions significantly contributing to this complexity. One method of capturing higher-order interactions is through traversing the brain network using random walks. The efficacy of these random walks depends on the defined mutual interactions between two brain entities. More precise capture of higher-order interactions enables a better reflection of the brain's intrinsic neurophysiological characteristics. One well-established neurophysiological concept is Homotopic Functional Connectivity (HoFC), which illustrates the synchronized spontaneous activity between corresponding regions in the brain's left and right hemispheres. We employ node2vec, a random walk node embedding approach, alongside resting-state fMRI from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to obtain higher-order feature vectors. We assess the efficacy of different functional connectivity parameterizations using HoFC. The results indicates that the quality of capturing higher-order interactions largely depends on the statistical dependency measure between brain regions. Higher-order interactions defined by partial correlation, better reflects HoFC compare to other statistical associations. In this case of first-order interactions, tangent space embedding more effectively demonstrates HoFC. The findings validate HoFC and underscore the importance of functional connectivity construction method in capturing intrinsic characteristics of the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Faced with complex problems, the human brain demonstrates a remarkable capacity to transcend sensory input and form latent understandings of perceived world patterns. However, this cognitive capacity is not explicitly considered or encoded in current large language models (LLMs). As a result, LLMs often struggle to capture latent structures and model uncertainty in complex compositional reasoning tasks. This work introduces a novel Bayesian prompting approach that facilitates training-free Bayesian inference with LLMs by using a verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). While traditional Bayesian approaches typically depend on extensive data and predetermined mathematical structures for learning latent factors and dependencies, our approach efficiently reasons latent variables and their probabilistic dependencies by prompting LLMs to adhere to Bayesian principles. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence elicitation and text generation quality, demonstrating its potential to improve AI language understanding systems, especially in modeling uncertainty.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The preclinical stage of many neurodegenerative diseases can span decades before symptoms become apparent. Understanding the sequence of preclinical biomarker changes provides a critical opportunity for early diagnosis and effective intervention prior to significant loss of patients' brain functions. The main challenge to early detection lies in the absence of direct observation of the disease state and the considerable variability in both biomarkers and disease dynamics among individuals. Recent research hypothesized the existence of subgroups with distinct biomarker patterns due to co-morbidities and degrees of brain resilience. Our ability to early diagnose and intervene during the preclinical stage of neurodegenerative diseases will be enhanced by further insights into heterogeneity in the biomarker-disease relationship. In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attempt to identify the systematic patterns within the heterogeneous AD biomarker-disease cascade. Specifically, we quantify the disease progression using a dynamic latent variable whose mixture distribution represents patient subgroups. Model estimation uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the number of clusters determined by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We report simulation studies that investigate the performance of the proposed model in finite sample settings that are similar to our motivating application. We apply the proposed model to the BIOCARD data, a longitudinal study that was conducted over two decades among individuals who were initially cognitively normal. Our application yields evidence consistent with the hypothetical model of biomarker dynamics presented in Jack et al. (2013). In addition, our analysis identified two subgroups with distinct disease-onset patterns. Finally, we develop a dynamic prediction approach to improve the precision of prognoses.</td>

This enables improved robustness and generalization versus deep neural networks, which typically process one modality and are vulnerable to perturbations. While defense methods exist, they do not generalize well across perturbations. We developed a fusion model combining background and foreground features from CNNs trained on Imagenet and Places365. We tested its robustness to human-perceivable perturbations on MS COCO. The fusion model improved robustness, especially for classes with greater context variability. Our proposed solution for integrating multiple modalities provides a new approach to enhance robustness and may be complementary to existing methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Signals from interacting brain regions display transient synchronization of phases and amplitudes in different frequencies. Commonly, the interaction between regions of the brain is quantitatively described by either analyzing the correlations of amplitudes of the measured signals or by calculating phase-synchronization measures. However, for a complete picture of the interactions it is important to analyze the dynamics of both the amplitude and the phase. In this work, we present a new method for finding the coupling between brain regions by reconstructing the phase-amplitude dynamics directly from the measured electrophysiological signals. For this purpose, we use the recent advances in the field of phase-amplitude reduction of oscillatory systems, which allow the representation of an uncoupled oscillatory system as a phase-amplitude oscillator in a unique form using transformations (parametrizations) related to the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. By combining the parametrization method and the Fourier-Laplace averaging method of finding the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, we developed a novel method of assessing the transformation functions from the signals of the interacting oscillatory systems. The resulting reconstructed dynamical system is a network of phase-amplitude oscillators with the interactions between them represented as coupling functions in phase and amplitude coordinates. Using synthetic signals generated from several models with known and unknown theoretical phase-amplitude reduced forms, we demonstrate that our method is capable of finding the proper unique dynamic form of these oscillatory systems in the reduced phase-amplitude space. Our method can be applied to describe any network of interacting oscillators as a dynamical system using signals of the network elements.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The study of effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various sensory inputs. Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to estimate local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data visualization via dimensionality reduction is an important tool in exploratory data analysis. However, when the data are noisy, many existing methods fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. The method called Empirical Intrinsic Geometry (EIG) was previously proposed for performing dimensionality reduction on high dimensional dynamical processes while theoretically eliminating all noise. However, implementing EIG in practice requires the construction of high-dimensional histograms, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose a new data visualization method called Functional Information Geometry (FIG) for dynamical processes that adapts the EIG framework while using approaches from functional data analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting method outperforms a variant of EIG designed for visualization in terms of capturing the true structure, hyperparameter robustness, and computational speed. We then use our method to visualize EEG brain measurements of sleep activity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generating continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals through advanced artificial neural networks presents a novel opportunity to enhance brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. This capability has the potential to significantly enhance applications ranging from simulating dynamic brain activity and data augmentation to improving real-time epilepsy detection and BCI inference. By harnessing generative transformer neural networks, specifically designed for EEG signal generation, we can revolutionize the interpretation and interaction with neural data. Generative AI has demonstrated significant success across various domains, from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to content creation in visual arts and music. It distinguishes itself by using large-scale datasets to construct context windows during pre-training, a technique that has proven particularly effective in NLP, where models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks after extensive foundational training. However, the application of generative AI in the field of BCIs, particularly through the development of continuous, context-rich neural signal generators, has been limited. To address this, we introduce the Generative EEG Transformer (GET), a model leveraging transformer architecture tailored for EEG data. The GET model is pre-trained on diverse EEG datasets, including motor imagery and alpha wave datasets, enabling it to produce high-fidelity neural signals that maintain contextual integrity. Our empirical findings indicate that GET not only faithfully reproduces the frequency spectrum of the training data and input prompts but also robustly generates continuous neural signals. By adopting the successful training strategies of the NLP domain for BCIs, the GET sets a new standard for the development and application of neural signal generation technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This manuscript presents a novel method for discovering effective connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network of time series. To accurately perform Granger causality analysis from the first node to the second node, it is essential to eliminate the influence of all other nodes within the network. The approach proposed is to create a low-dimensional representation of all other nodes in the network using frequency-domain-based dynamic principal component analysis (spectral DPCA). The resulting scores are subsequently removed from the first and second nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the high-dimensional network. To conduct hypothesis testing on Granger causality, we propose a permutation-based causality test. This test enhances the accuracy of our findings when the error structures are non-Gaussian. The approach has been validated in extensive simulation studies, which demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been demonstrated to be both expedient and viable on real datasets, with particular success observed on multichannel EEG networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective. Sleep is a critical physiological process that plays a vital role in maintaining physical and mental health. Accurate detection of arousals and sleep stages is essential for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, as frequent and excessive occurrences of arousals disrupt sleep stage patterns and lead to poor sleep quality, negatively impacting physical and mental health. Polysomnography is a traditional method for arousal and sleep stage detection that is time-consuming and prone to high variability among experts. Approach. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach for arousal and sleep stage detection using fully convolutional neural networks. Our model, FullSleepNet, accepts a full-night single-channel EEG signal as input and produces segmentation masks for arousal and sleep stage labels. FullSleepNet comprises four modules: a convolutional module to extract local features, a recurrent module to capture long-range dependencies, an attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the input, and a segmentation module to output final predictions. Main results. By unifying the two interrelated tasks as segmentation problems and employing a multi-task learning approach, FullSleepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for arousal detection with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.70 on Sleep Heart Health Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis datasets. For sleep stage classification, FullSleepNet obtains comparable performance on both datasets, achieving an accuracy of 0.88 on the former and an accuracy of 0.83 on the latter. Significance. Our results demonstrate that FullSleepNet offers improved practicality, efficiency, and accuracy for the detection of arousal and classification of sleep stages using raw EEG signals as input.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we introduce Conditional Gumbel-Softmax as a method to perform end-to-end learning of the optimal feature subset for a given task and deep neural network (DNN) model, while adhering to certain pairwise constraints between the features. We do this by conditioning the selection of each feature in the subset on another feature. We demonstrate how this approach can be used to select the task-optimal nodes composing a wireless sensor network (WSN) while ensuring that none of the nodes that require communication between one another have too large of a distance between them, limiting the required power spent on this communication. We validate this approach on an emulated Wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) Sensor Network (WESN) solving a motor execution task. We analyze how the performance of the WESN varies as the constraints are made more stringent and how well the Conditional Gumbel-Softmax performs in comparison with a heuristic, greedy selection method. While the application focus of this paper is on wearable brain-computer interfaces, the proposed methodology is generic and can readily be applied to node deployment in wireless sensor networks and constrained feature selection in other applications as well.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generating continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals through advanced artificial neural networks presents a novel opportunity to enhance brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. This capability has the potential to significantly enhance applications ranging from simulating dynamic brain activity and data augmentation to improving real-time epilepsy detection and BCI inference. By harnessing generative transformer neural networks, specifically designed for EEG signal generation, we can revolutionize the interpretation and interaction with neural data. Generative AI has demonstrated significant success across various domains, from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to content creation in visual arts and music. It distinguishes itself by using large-scale datasets to construct context windows during pre-training, a technique that has proven particularly effective in NLP, where models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks after extensive foundational training. However, the application of generative AI in the field of BCIs, particularly through the development of continuous, context-rich neural signal generators, has been limited. To address this, we introduce the Generative EEG Transformer (GET), a model leveraging transformer architecture tailored for EEG data. The GET model is pre-trained on diverse EEG datasets, including motor imagery and alpha wave datasets, enabling it to produce high-fidelity neural signals that maintain contextual integrity. Our empirical findings indicate that GET not only faithfully reproduces the frequency spectrum of the training data and input prompts but also robustly generates continuous neural signals. By adopting the successful training strategies of the NLP domain for BCIs, the GET sets a new standard for the development and application of neural signal generation technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The current electroencephalogram (EEG) based deep learning models are typically designed for specific datasets and applications in brain-computer interaction (BCI), limiting the scale of the models and thus diminishing their perceptual capabilities and generalizability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large EEG Models (LEMs). We hope that LEMs can break through the limitations of different task types of EEG datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training. Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. However, compared to text data, the volume of EEG datasets is generally small and the format varies widely. For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for EEG called Large Brain Model (LaBraM). LaBraM enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the EEG signals into EEG channel patches. Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes. We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches. The LaBraMs were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks. Experiments on abnormal detection, event type classification, emotion recognition, and gait prediction show that our LaBraM outperforms all compared SOTA methods in their respective fields. Our code is available at https://github.com/935963004/LaBraM.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers have reported high decoding accuracy (>95%) using non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding tasks like image decoding, emotion recognition, auditory spatial attention detection, etc. Since these EEG data were usually collected with well-designed paradigms in labs, the reliability and robustness of the corresponding decoding methods were doubted by some researchers, and they argued that such decoding accuracy was overestimated due to the inherent temporal autocorrelation of EEG signals. However, the coupling between the stimulus-driven neural responses and the EEG temporal autocorrelations makes it difficult to confirm whether this overestimation exists in truth. Furthermore, the underlying pitfalls behind overestimated decoding accuracy have not been fully explained due to a lack of appropriate formulation. In this work, we formulate the pitfall in various EEG decoding tasks in a unified framework. EEG data were recorded from watermelons to remove stimulus-driven neural responses. Labels were assigned to continuous EEG according to the experimental design for EEG recording of several typical datasets, and then the decoding methods were conducted. The results showed the label can be successfully decoded as long as continuous EEG data with the same label were split into training and test sets. Further analysis indicated that high accuracy of various BCI decoding tasks could be achieved by associating labels with EEG intrinsic temporal autocorrelation features. These results underscore the importance of choosing the right experimental designs and data splits in BCI decoding tasks to prevent inflated accuracies due to EEG temporal autocorrelation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer significant advantages for individuals with restricted limb mobility. However, challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution impede accurate feature extraction from EEG signals, thereby affecting the classification accuracy of different actions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end dual-branch network (EEG-DBNet) that decodes the temporal and spectral sequences of EEG signals in parallel through two distinct network branches. Each branch comprises a local convolutional block and a global convolutional block. The local convolutional block transforms the source signal from the temporal-spatial domain to the temporal-spectral domain. By varying the number of filters and convolution kernel sizes, the local convolutional blocks in different branches adjust the length of their respective dimension sequences. Different types of pooling layers are then employed to emphasize the features of various dimension sequences, setting the stage for subsequent global feature extraction. The global convolution block splits and reconstructs the feature of the signal sequence processed by the local convolution block in the same branch and further extracts features through the dilated causal convolutional neural networks. Finally, the outputs from the two branches are concatenated, and signal classification is completed via a fully connected layer. Our proposed method achieves classification accuracies of 85.84% and 91.60% on the BCI Competition 4-2a and BCI Competition 4-2b datasets, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models.

Euclidean Alignment (EA) and Data Augmentation (DA) are two promising techniques for improving DNN training by permitting the use of data from multiple subjects, increasing the data, and regularizing the available data. In this paper, we perform a detailed evaluation of the combined use of EA and DA with DNNs for EEG decoding. We trained individual models and shared models with data from multiple subjects and showed that combining EA and DA generates synergies that improve the accuracy of most models and datasets. Also, the shared models combined with fine-tuning benefited the most, with an overall increase of 8.41\% in classification accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) severely impairs patients' ability to communicate, often leading to a decline in their quality of life within a few years of diagnosis. The P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication method by interpreting a subject's EEG response to characters presented on a grid interface.   This paper addresses the common speed limitations encountered in training efficient P300-based multi-subject classifiers by introducing innovative "across-subject" classifiers. We leverage a combination of the second-generation Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2) and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize stimuli and suggest word completion choices based on typing history. Additionally, we employ a multi-layered smoothing technique to accommodate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.   Through extensive simulations involving random sampling of EEG data from subjects, we demonstrate significant speed enhancements in typing passages containing rare and OOV words. These optimizations result in approximately 10% improvement in character-level typing speed and up to 40% improvement in multi-word prediction. We demonstrate that augmenting standard row/column highlighting techniques with layered word prediction yields close-to-optimal performance.   Furthermore, we explore both "within-subject" and "across-subject" training techniques, showing that speed improvements are consistent across both approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Invasive brain-computer interfaces have garnered significant attention due to their high performance. The current intracranial stereoElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) foundation models typically build univariate representations based on a single channel. Some of them further use Transformer to model the relationship among channels. However, due to the locality and specificity of brain computation, their performance on more difficult tasks, e.g., speech decoding, which demands intricate processing in specific brain regions, is yet to be fully investigated. We hypothesize that building multi-variate representations within certain brain regions can better capture the specific neural processing. To explore this hypothesis, we collect a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset, targeting language-related brain networks, over 12 subjects. Leveraging this benchmark dataset, we developed the Du-IN model that can extract contextual embeddings from specific brain regions through discrete codebook-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves SOTA performance on the downstream 61-word classification task, surpassing all baseline models. Model comparison and ablation analysis reveal that our design choices, including (i) multi-variate representation by fusing channels in vSMC and STG regions and (ii) self-supervision by discrete codebook-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to these performances. Collectively, our approach, inspired by neuroscience findings, capitalizing on multi-variate neural representation from specific brain regions, is suitable for invasive brain modeling. It marks a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The distribution shift of electroencephalography (EEG) data causes poor generalization of braincomputer interfaces (BCIs) in unseen domains. Some methods try to tackle this challenge by collecting a portion of user data for calibration. However, it is time-consuming, mentally fatiguing, and user-unfriendly. To achieve zerocalibration BCIs, most studies employ domain generalization (DG) techniques to learn invariant features across different domains in the training set. However, they fail to fully explore invariant features within the same domain, leading to limited performance. In this paper, we present an novel method to learn domain-invariant features from both interdomain and intra-domain perspectives. For intra-domain invariant features, we propose a knowledge distillation framework to extract EEG phase-invariant features within one domain. As for inter-domain invariant features, correlation alignment is used to bridge distribution gaps across multiple domains. Experimental results on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing stateof-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first domain generalization study that exploit Fourier phase information as an intra-domain invariant feature to facilitate EEG generalization. More importantly, the zerocalibration BCI based on inter- and intra-domain invariant features has significant potential to advance the practical applications of BCIs in real world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain's complex functionality emerges from network interactions that go beyond dyadic connections, with higher-order interactions significantly contributing to this complexity. One method of capturing higher-order interactions is through traversing the brain network using random walks. The efficacy of these random walks depends on the defined mutual interactions between two brain entities. More precise capture of higher-order interactions enables a better reflection of the brain's intrinsic neurophysiological characteristics. One well-established neurophysiological concept is Homotopic Functional Connectivity (HoFC), which illustrates the synchronized spontaneous activity between corresponding regions in the brain's left and right hemispheres. We employ node2vec, a random walk node embedding approach, alongside resting-state fMRI from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to obtain higher-order feature vectors. We assess the efficacy of different functional connectivity parameterizations using HoFC. The results indicates that the quality of capturing higher-order interactions largely depends on the statistical dependency measure between brain regions. Higher-order interactions defined by partial correlation, better reflects HoFC compare to other statistical associations. In this case of first-order interactions, tangent space embedding more effectively demonstrates HoFC. The findings validate HoFC and underscore the importance of functional connectivity construction method in capturing intrinsic characteristics of the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>FMRI data are noisy, complicated to acquire, and typically go through many steps of processing before they are used in a study or clinical practice. Being able to visualize and understand the data from the start through the completion of processing, while being confident that each intermediate step was successful, is challenging. AFNI's "afni_proc.py" is a tool to create and run a processing pipeline for FMRI data. With its flexible features, "afni_proc.py" allows users to both control and evaluate their processing at a detailed level. It has been designed to keep users informed about all processing steps: it does not just process the data, but first outputs a fully commented processing script that the users can read, query, interpret and refer back to. Having this full provenance is important for being able to understand each step of processing; it also promotes transparency and reproducibility by keeping the record of individual-level processing and modeling specifics in a single, shareable place. Additionally, "afni_proc.py" creates pipelines that contain several automatic self-checks for potential problems during runtime. The output directory contains a dictionary of relevant quantities that can be programmatically queried for potential issues and a systematic, interactive quality control (QC) HTML. All of these features help users evaluate and understand their data and processing in detail. We describe these and other aspects of "afni_proc.py" here using a set of task-based and resting state FMRI example commands.</td>

We account for temporal correlation in the data by assuming that observations are characterized by an underlying and unobserved hidden discrete autoregressive process. We assume multivariate Gaussian emission distributions and capture spatial dependencies by modeling the state-specific precision matrices via graphical horseshoe priors. We characterize the mixing probabilities of the hidden process via a cumulative shrinkage prior that accommodates zero-inflated parameters for non-active components, and further incorporate a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior to estimate the effective number of states from the data. For posterior inference, we develop a sampling procedure that allows estimation of the number of discrete autoregressive lags and the number of states, and that cleverly avoids having to deal with the changing dimensions of the parameter space. We thoroughly investigate performance of our proposed methodology through several simulation studies. We further illustrate the use of our approach for the estimation of dynamic brain connectivity based on fMRI data collected on a subject performing a task-based experiment on latent learning</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans experience the world through constantly changing visual stimuli, where scenes can shift and move, change in appearance, and vary in distance. The dynamic nature of visual perception is a fundamental aspect of our daily lives, yet the large majority of research on object and scene processing, particularly using fMRI, has focused on static stimuli. While studies of static image perception are attractive due to their computational simplicity, they impose a strong non-naturalistic constraint on our investigation of human vision. In contrast, dynamic visual stimuli offer a more ecologically-valid approach but present new challenges due to the interplay between spatial and temporal information, making it difficult to disentangle the representations of stable image features and motion. To overcome this limitation -- given dynamic inputs, we explicitly decouple the modeling of static image representations and motion representations in the human brain. Three results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. First, we show that visual motion information as optical flow can be predicted (or decoded) from brain activity as measured by fMRI. Second, we show that this predicted motion can be used to realistically animate static images using a motion-conditioned video diffusion model (where the motion is driven by fMRI brain activity). Third, we show prediction in the reverse direction: existing video encoders can be fine-tuned to predict fMRI brain activity from video imagery, and can do so more effectively than image encoders. This foundational work offers a novel, extensible framework for interpreting how the human brain processes dynamic visual information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the fields of brain-computer interaction and cognitive neuroscience, effective decoding of auditory signals from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is key to understanding how the brain processes complex auditory information. Although existing methods have enhanced decoding capabilities, limitations remain in information utilization and model representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-task learning model, Physics-informed Embedding Network with Multi-Task Transformer (PEMT-Net), which enhances decoding performance through physics-informed embedding and deep learning techniques. PEMT-Net consists of two principal components: feature augmentation and classification. For feature augmentation, we propose a novel approach by creating neural embedding graphs via node embedding, utilizing random walks to simulate the physical diffusion of neural information. This method captures both local and non-local information overflow and proposes a position encoding based on relative physical coordinates. In the classification segment, we propose adaptive embedding fusion to maximally capture linear and non-linear characteristics. Furthermore, we propose an innovative parameter-sharing mechanism to optimize the retention and learning of extracted features. Experiments on a specific dataset demonstrate PEMT-Net's significant performance in multi-task auditory signal decoding, surpassing existing methods and offering new insights into the brain's mechanisms for processing complex auditory information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain. One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score". Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing. This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing. Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages. We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain. We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward. Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position. This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure. We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder that typically affects a person's mood, cognition, behavior, and physical health. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data are widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of MDD. While multi-site fMRI data can provide more data for training reliable diagnostic models, significant cross-site data heterogeneity would result in poor model generalizability. Many domain adaptation methods are designed to reduce the distributional differences between sites to some extent, but usually ignore overfitting problem of the model on the source domain. Intuitively, target data augmentation can alleviate the overfitting problem by forcing the model to learn more generalized features and reduce the dependence on source domain data. In this work, we propose a new augmentation-based unsupervised cross-domain fMRI adaptation (AUFA) framework for automatic diagnosis of MDD. The AUFA consists of 1) a graph representation learning module for extracting rs-fMRI features with spatial attention, 2) a domain adaptation module for feature alignment between source and target data, 3) an augmentation-based self-optimization module for alleviating model overfitting on the source domain, and 4) a classification module. Experimental results on 1,089 subjects suggest that AUFA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in MDD identification. Our approach not only reduces data heterogeneity between different sites, but also localizes disease-related functional connectivity abnormalities and provides interpretability for the model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering the human visual experience through brain activities captured by fMRI represents a compelling and cutting-edge challenge in the field of neuroscience research. Compared to merely predicting the viewed image itself, decoding brain activity into meaningful captions provides a higher-level interpretation and summarization of visual information, which naturally enhances the application flexibility in real-world situations. In this work, we introduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity. Our MindSemantix explores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain activity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model. To effectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose Brain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture. It integrates a pre-trained brain encoder with a frozen LLM to achieve multi-modal alignment of brain-vision-language and establish a robust brain-language correspondence. To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we pre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using self-supervised learning techniques. MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction. Conditioned by MindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating with advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in understanding brain visual perception. MindSemantix generates high-quality captions that are deeply rooted in the visual and semantic information derived from brain activity. This approach has demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements over prior art. Our code will be released.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human brain is a highly efficient processing unit, and understanding how it works can inspire new algorithms and architectures in machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named Brain Activation Network (BRACTIVE), a transformer-based approach to studying the human visual brain. The main objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with corresponding brain representations via fMRI signals. It allows us to identify the brain's Regions of Interest (ROI) of the subjects. Unlike previous brain research methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and are limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this identification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that BRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as face and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and indicating potential applicability to various object categories. More importantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep neural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks. It encourages the potential of BRACTIVE in both neuroscience and machine intelligence studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Drawing inspiration from the hierarchical processing of the human auditory system, which transforms sound from low-level acoustic features to high-level semantic understanding, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine audio reconstruction method. Leveraging non-invasive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, our approach mimics the inverse pathway of auditory processing. Initially, we utilize CLAP to decode fMRI data coarsely into a low-dimensional semantic space, followed by a fine-grained decoding into the high-dimensional AudioMAE latent space guided by semantic features. These fine-grained neural features serve as conditions for audio reconstruction through a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Validation on three public fMRI datasets-Brain2Sound, Brain2Music, and Brain2Speech-underscores the superiority of our coarse-to-fine decoding method over stand-alone fine-grained approaches, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in metrics like FD, FAD, and KL. Moreover, by employing semantic prompts during decoding, we enhance the quality of reconstructed audio when semantic features are suboptimal. The demonstrated versatility of our model across diverse stimuli highlights its potential as a universal brain-to-audio framework. This research contributes to the comprehension of the human auditory system, pushing boundaries in neural decoding and audio reconstruction methodologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering language from brain activity is a crucial task in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric. This improvement demonstrates the advancement of our model towards real-world applications and underscores its potential in advancing BCI research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Growing interest and investment in the capabilities of foundation models has positioned such systems to impact a wide array of public services. Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the "foundation" layer, our framework proposes the "subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the "surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate "subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural environment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Centred Kernel Alignment (CKA) has recently emerged as a popular metric to compare activations from biological and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to quantify the alignment between internal representations derived from stimuli sets (e.g. images, text, video) that are presented to both systems. In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment.</td>

In this paper, we formally define and study the problem of identifying such minimal evidence groups (MEGs) for claim verification. We show that MEG identification can be reduced from Set Cover problem, based on entailment inference of whether a given evidence group provides full/partial support to a claim. Our proposed approach achieves 18.4% and 34.8% absolute improvements on the WiCE and SciFact datasets over LLM prompting.

We retrospectively analysed data from 17,(46) healthy controls and 22,(24) individuals with TLE who underwent scalp EEG and (MEG) recordings as part of presurgical evaluation. Resting-state, eyes-closed recordings were source reconstructed using the standardized low-resolution brain electrographic tomography (sLORETA) method. We extracted low (slow) 6-9 Hz and high (fast) 10-11 Hz alpha relative band power and calculated the alpha power ratio by dividing low (slow) alpha by high (fast) alpha. This ratio was computed for all brain regions in all individuals.   Alpha oscillations were slower in individuals with TLE than controls (p<0.05). This effect was present in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, and across widespread brain regions.   Alpha slowing in TLE was found in both EEG and MEG recordings. We interpret greater low (slow)-alpha as greater deviation from health.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning techniques can be used to first training unsupervised models on large amounts of unlabelled data, before fine-tuning the models on specific tasks. This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation. All code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricsinaruto/MEG-transfer-decoding).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we have adopted the diffusion-based image reconstruction pipeline previously used for fMRI image reconstruction and applied it to Electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG encoding method is very simple, and forms a baseline from which more sophisticated EEG encoding methods can be compared. We have also evaluated the fidelity of the generated image using the same metrics used in the previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) works. Our results show that while the reconstruction from EEG recorded to rapidly presented images is not as good as reconstructions from fMRI to slower presented images, it holds a surprising amount of information that could be applied in specific use cases. Also, EEG-based image reconstruction works better in some categories-such as land animals and food-than others, shedding new light on previous findings of EEG's sensitivity to those categories and revealing potential for these methods to further understand EEG responses to human visual coding. More investigation should use longer-duration image stimulations to elucidate the later components that might be salient to the different image categories.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience has long been an essential driver of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper reviews predictive coding, from theoretical neuroscience, and variational autoencoders, from machine learning, identifying the common origin and mathematical framework underlying both areas. As each area is prominent within its respective field, more firmly connecting these areas could prove useful in the dialogue between neuroscience and machine learning. After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Over 85 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed annually in the US, of which approximately one quarter focus on the abdomen. Given the current radiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligence to alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Prior state-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leverage vision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generally limited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic health record (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we train using paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes (1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluate Merlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted (off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings), phenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval (image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include 5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3D semantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test set of 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two public CT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevant evaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures and training strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existing task-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assess training data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore, unlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we perform all training on a single GPU.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Equivariant neural networks have in recent years become an important technique for guiding architecture selection for neural networks with many applications in domains ranging from medical image analysis to quantum chemistry. In particular, as the most general linear equivariant layers with respect to the regular representation, group convolutions have been highly impactful in numerous applications. Although equivariant architectures have been studied extensively, much less is known about the training dynamics of equivariant neural networks. Concurrently, neural tangent kernels (NTKs) have emerged as a powerful tool to analytically understand the training dynamics of wide neural networks. In this work, we combine these two fields for the first time by giving explicit expressions for NTKs of group convolutional neural networks. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate superior performance for equivariant NTKs over non-equivariant NTKs on a classification task for medical images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in generative vision-language models (VLMs) have exciting potential implications for AI in radiology, yet VLMs are also known to produce hallucinations, nonsensical text, and other unwanted behaviors that can waste clinicians' time and cause patient harm. Drawing on recent work on direct preference optimization (DPO), we propose a simple method for modifying the behavior of pretrained VLMs performing radiology report generation by suppressing unwanted types of generations. We apply our method to the prevention of hallucinations of prior exams, addressing a long-established problem behavior in models performing chest X-ray report generation. Across our experiments, we find that DPO fine-tuning achieves a 3.2-4.8x reduction in lines hallucinating prior exams while maintaining model performance on clinical accuracy metrics. Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to apply DPO to medical VLMs, providing a data- and compute- efficient way to suppress problem behaviors while maintaining overall clinical accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In difficult decision-making scenarios, it is common to have conflicting opinions among expert human decision-makers as there may not be a single right answer. Such decisions may be guided by different attributes that can be used to characterize an individual's decision. We introduce a novel dataset for medical triage decision-making, labeled with a set of decision-maker attributes (DMAs). This dataset consists of 62 scenarios, covering six different DMAs, including ethical principles such as fairness and moral desert. We present a novel software framework for human-aligned decision-making by utilizing these DMAs, paving the way for trustworthy AI with better guardrails. Specifically, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can serve as ethical decision-makers, and how their decisions can be aligned to different DMAs using zero-shot prompting. Our experiments focus on different open-source models with varying sizes and training techniques, such as Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. Finally, we also introduce a new form of weighted self-consistency that improves the overall quantified performance. Our results provide new research directions in the use of LLMs as alignable decision-makers.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in multi-modal algorithms have driven and been driven by the increasing availability of large image-text datasets, leading to significant strides in various fields, including computational pathology. However, in most existing medical image-text datasets, the text typically provides high-level summaries that may not sufficiently describe sub-tile regions within a large pathology image. For example, an image might cover an extensive tissue area containing cancerous and healthy regions, but the accompanying text might only specify that this image is a cancer slide, lacking the nuanced details needed for in-depth analysis. In this study, we introduce STimage-1K4M, a novel dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing genomic features for sub-tile images. STimage-1K4M contains 1,149 images derived from spatial transcriptomics data, which captures gene expression information at the level of individual spatial spots within a pathology image. Specifically, each image in the dataset is broken down into smaller sub-image tiles, with each tile paired with 15,000-30,000 dimensional gene expressions. With 4,293,195 pairs of sub-tile images and gene expressions, STimage-1K4M offers unprecedented granularity, paving the way for a wide range of advanced research in multi-modal data analysis an innovative applications in computational pathology, and beyond.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Digital mammography is essential to breast cancer detection, and deep learning offers promising tools for faster and more accurate mammogram analysis. In radiology and other high-stakes environments, uninterpretable ("black box") deep learning models are unsuitable and there is a call in these fields to make interpretable models. Recent work in interpretable computer vision provides transparency to these formerly black boxes by utilizing prototypes for case-based explanations, achieving high accuracy in applications including mammography. However, these models struggle with precise feature localization, reasoning on large portions of an image when only a small part is relevant. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel multi-scale interpretable deep learning model for mammographic mass margin classification. Our contribution not only offers an interpretable model with reasoning aligned with radiologist practices, but also provides a general architecture for computer vision with user-configurable prototypes from coarse- to fine-grained prototypes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces MedExQA, a novel benchmark in medical question-answering, to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) understanding of medical knowledge through explanations. By constructing datasets across five distinct medical specialties that are underrepresented in current datasets and further incorporating multiple explanations for each question-answer pair, we address a major gap in current medical QA benchmarks which is the absence of comprehensive assessments of LLMs' ability to generate nuanced medical explanations. Our work highlights the importance of explainability in medical LLMs, proposes an effective methodology for evaluating models beyond classification accuracy, and sheds light on one specific domain, speech language pathology, where current LLMs including GPT4 lack good understanding. Our results show generation evaluation with multiple explanations aligns better with human assessment, highlighting an opportunity for a more robust automated comprehension assessment for LLMs. To diversify open-source medical LLMs (currently mostly based on Llama2), this work also proposes a new medical model, MedPhi-2, based on Phi-2 (2.7B). The model outperformed medical LLMs based on Llama2-70B in generating explanations, showing its effectiveness in the resource-constrained medical domain.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we are introducing a Quantum-Classical Bayesian Neural Network (QCBNN) that is capable to perform uncertainty-aware classification of classical medical dataset. This model is a symbiosis of a classical Convolutional NN that performs ultra-sound image processing and a quantum circuit that generates its stochastic weights, within a Bayesian learning framework. To test the utility of this idea for the possible future deployment in the medical sector we track multiple behavioral metrics that capture both predictive performance as well as model's uncertainty. It is our ambition to create a hybrid model that is capable to classify samples in a more uncertainty aware fashion, which will advance the trustworthiness of these models and thus bring us step closer to utilizing them in the industry. We test multiple setups for quantum circuit for this task, and our best architectures display bigger uncertainty gap between correctly and incorrectly identified samples than its classical benchmark at an expense of a slight drop in predictive performance. The innovation of this paper is two-fold: (1) combining of different approaches that allow the stochastic weights from the quantum circuit to be continues thus allowing the model to classify application-driven dataset; (2) studying architectural features of quantum circuit that make-or-break these models, which pave the way into further investigation of more informed architectural designs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Exoskeleton devices impose kinematic constraints on a user's motion and affect their stability due to added mass but also due to the simplified mechanical design. This paper investigates how these constraints resulting from simplified mechanical designs impact the gait kinematics and stability of users by wearing an ankle exoskeleton with changeable degree of freedom (DoF). The exoskeleton used in this paper allows one, two, or three DoF at the ankle, simulating different levels of mechanical complexity. This effect was evaluated in a pilot study consisting of six participants walking on a straight path. The results show that increasing the exoskeleton DoF results in an improvement of several metrics, including kinematics and gait parameters. The transition from 1 DoF to 2 DoF is shown to have a larger effect than the transition from 2 DoF to 3 DoF for an ankle exoskeleton. However, an exoskeleton with 3 DoF at the ankle featured the best results. Increasing the number of DoF resulted in stability values closer the values when walking without the exoskeleton, despite the added weight of the exoskeleton.</td>

However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/CARES.</td>
