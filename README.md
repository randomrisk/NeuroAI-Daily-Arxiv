<td style='padding: 4px;'>When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning.   In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-risking condition characterized by bleeding within the brain parenchyma. ICU readmission in ICH patients is a critical outcome, reflecting both clinical severity and resource utilization. Accurate prediction of ICU readmission risk is crucial for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing healthcare resources. This study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) databases, which contain comprehensive clinical and demographic data on ICU patients. Patients with ICH were identified from both databases. Various clinical, laboratory, and demographic features were extracted for analysis based on both overview literature and experts' opinions. Preprocessing methods like imputing and sampling were applied to improve the performance of our models. Machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost, and Random Forest, were employed to develop predictive models for ICU readmission risk. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The developed models demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for ICU readmission in ICH patients, with key predictors including demographic information, clinical parameters, and laboratory measurements. Our study provides a predictive framework for ICU readmission risk in ICH patients, which can aid in clinical decision-making and improve resource allocation in intensive care settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis. Cases of long-range dependencies are also presented to further illustrate the effectiveness of ALTER. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/yushuowiki/ALTER}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing the intricate local morphology of neurons and their long-range projecting axons can address many connectivity related questions in neuroscience. The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Representational analysis explores how input data of a neural system are encoded in high dimensional spaces of its distributed neural activations, and how we can compare different systems, for instance, artificial neural networks and brains, on those grounds. While existing methods offer important insights, they typically do not account for local intrinsic geometrical properties within the high-dimensional representation spaces. To go beyond these limitations, we explore Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Ricci flow as tools to study the alignment of representations between humans and artificial neural systems on a geometric level. As a proof-of-principle study, we compared the representations of face stimuli between VGG-Face, a human-aligned version of VGG-Face, and corresponding human similarity judgments from a large online study. Using this discrete geometric framework, we were able to identify local structural similarities and differences by examining the distributions of node and edge curvature and higher-level properties by detecting and comparing community structure in the representational graphs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>By retracing my scientific journey that began 20 years ago, I highlight in this thesis the need to consider the organization of the brain, which is certainly globally hierarchical, but also highly distributed and mixed in the neuronal response of its different areas (by focusing on the sensorimotor cortex-basal ganglia network). I also emphasize the importance of adopting behavioral paradigms that reflect as much as possible the characteristics of the scenarios encountered in the real life of animals. And finally, I mention the importance of "disintegrating" the way data analysis is traditionally carried out, and of taking into account the dynamic nature of behavior, for example by favoring the study of behavioral variables and so-called "latent" neuronal activities. I conclude this thesis by presenting the vision of my ideal laboratory in a perspective of 5 to 10 years from today. This laboratory would have two experimental devices, a first, classic, for carrying out tests in a constrained and therefore unnatural environment, the data of which would be compared to those from a second device called "naturalistic" in which the animals could potentially express their entire behavioral repertoire. The tasks tested would be characterized by strong ecological principles, such as in those simulating the properties of foraging, and the data would make it possible to test hypotheses based on the progressive addition of ecological components in these tasks, all this in order to maintain control over the interpretability of these data which are complex by nature.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain's parallel and energy-efficient processing, offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence. In this study, we fabricated optimized spin-transfer torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and investigated their dynamic behaviors using a hybrid excitation scheme combining AC laser illumination and DC bias currents. Laser-induced thermal gradients generate pulsed thermoelectric voltages ($V_{\text{AC}}$) via the Tunnel Magneto-Seebeck (TMS) effect, while the addition of bias currents enhances this response, producing both $V_{\text{AC}}$ and a DC component ($V_{\text{DC}}$). Magnetic field sweeps reveal distinct switching between parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetization states in both voltage components, supporting multistate memory applications. Millivolt-range thermovoltage signals in open-circuit conditions demonstrate CMOS compatibility, enabling simplified, scalable neuromorphic systems. Under biased conditions, enhanced thermovoltage outputs exhibit intriguing phenomena, including spikes correlated with Barkhausen jumps and double-switching behavior, offering insights into magnetization dynamics and vortex transitions. These features resemble neural spiking behavior, suggesting applications in spiking neural networks, reservoir computing, multistate logic, analog computing, and high-resolution sensing. By bridging spintronic phenomena with practical applications, this work provides a versatile platform for next-generation AI technologies and adaptive computing architectures.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) spellers are a promising communication tool for individuals with disabilities. This Brain-Computer Interface utilizes scalp potential data from (electroencephalography) EEG electrodes on a subject's head to decode specific letters or arbitrary targets the subject is looking at on a screen. However, deep neural networks for SSVEP spellers often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen subjects, largely due to the high variability in EEG data. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach combining data augmentation and language modeling to enhance the performance of SSVEP spellers. Using the Benchmark dataset from Tsinghua University, we explore various data augmentation techniques, including frequency masking, time masking, and noise injection, to improve the robustness of deep learning models. Additionally, we integrate a language model (CharRNN) with EEGNet to incorporate linguistic context, significantly enhancing word-level decoding accuracy. Our results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 2.9 percent over the baseline, with time masking and language modeling showing the most promise. This work paves the way for more accurate and generalizable SSVEP speller systems, offering improved communication solutions for individuals with disabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Meta-learning, i.e., "learning to learn", is a promising approach to enable efficient BCI classifier training with limited amounts of data. It can effectively use collections of in some way similar classification tasks, with rapid adaptation to new tasks where only minimal data are available. However, applying meta-learning to existing classifiers and BCI tasks requires significant effort. To address this issue, we propose EEG-Reptile, an automated library that leverages meta-learning to improve classification accuracy of neural networks in BCIs and other EEG-based applications. It utilizes the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to adapt neural network classifiers of EEG data to the inter-subject domain, allowing for more efficient fine-tuning for a new subject on a small amount of data. The proposed library incorporates an automated hyperparameter tuning module, a data management pipeline, and an implementation of the Reptile meta-learning algorithm. EEG-Reptile automation level allows using it without deep understanding of meta-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEG-Reptile on two benchmark datasets (BCI IV 2a, Lee2019 MI) and three neural network architectures (EEGNet, FBCNet, EEG-Inception). Our library achieved improvement in both zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios compared to traditional transfer learning approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Air-writing is a challenging task that combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, offering an intuitive and natural approach for human-computer interaction. However, current air-writing solutions face two primary challenges: (1) their dependency on complex sensors (e.g., Radar, EEGs and others) for capturing precise handwritten trajectories, and (2) the absence of a video-based air-writing dataset that covers a comprehensive vocabulary range. These limitations impede their practicality in various real-world scenarios, including the use on devices like iPhones and laptops. To tackle these challenges, we present the groundbreaking air-writing Chinese character video dataset (AWCV-100K-UCAS2024), serving as a pioneering benchmark for video-based air-writing. This dataset captures handwritten trajectories in various real-world scenarios using commonly accessible RGB cameras, eliminating the need for complex sensors. AWCV-100K-UCAS2024 includes 8.8 million video frames, encompassing the complete set of 3,755 characters from the GB2312-80 level-1 set (GB1). Furthermore, we introduce our baseline approach, the video-based character recognizer (VCRec). VCRec adeptly extracts fingertip features from sparse visual cues and employs a spatio-temporal sequence module for analysis. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of VCRec compared to existing models in recognizing air-written characters, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This breakthrough paves the way for enhanced human-computer interaction in real-world contexts. Moreover, our approach leverages affordable RGB cameras, enabling its applicability in a diverse range of scenarios. The code and data examples will be made public at https://github.com/wmeiqi/AWCV.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The prevailing educational methods predominantly rely on traditional classroom instruction or online delivery, often limiting the teachers' ability to engage effectively with all the students simultaneously. A more intrinsic method of evaluating student attentiveness during lectures can enable the educators to tailor the course materials and their teaching styles in order to better meet the students' needs. The aim of this paper is to enhance teaching quality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the classroom activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing machine learning algorithms, this study proposes a comprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables, enabling the effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based on specific parameters. However, the real-time impact of machine learning models necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level of students' comprehension with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface was introduced that accesses the values of the system's parameters to determine a student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the proposed system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by the students, consider the system's cost, and establish trust in its efficacy. This paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue through the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework for addressing key considerations for future research directions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>People exhibit unique emotional responses. In the same scenario, the emotional reactions of two individuals can be either similar or vastly different. For instance, consider one person's reaction to an invitation to smoke versus another person's response to a query about their sleep quality. The identification of these individual traits through the observation of common physical parameters opens the door to a wide range of applications, including psychological analysis, criminology, disease prediction, addiction control, and more. While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics, inertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a novel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected from 80 participants using a portable EEG headset. We also conduct a statistical analysis of the collected data utilizing box plots. Our analysis uncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach for identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques on EEG data. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we explore two deep-learning models to compare the performance of our solution. Consequently, we have developed an integrated, real-time trait identification solution using EEG data, based on the insights from our analysis. To validate our approach, we conducted a rigorous user evaluation with an additional 20 participants. The outcomes of this evaluation illustrate both high accuracy and favorable user ratings, emphasizing the robust potential of our proposed method to serve as a versatile solution for human trait identification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vection, the visual illusion of self-motion, provides a strong marker of the VR user experience and plays an important role in both presence and cybersickness. Traditional measurements have been conducted using questionnaires, which exhibit inherent limitations due to their subjective nature and preventing real-time adjustments. Detecting vection in real time would allow VR systems to adapt to users' needs, improving comfort and minimizing negative effects like motion sickness. This paper investigates the presence of vection markers in electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals using evoked potentials (brain responses to external stimulations).   We designed a VR experiment that induces vection using two conditions: (1) forward acceleration or (2) backward acceleration. We recorded both electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and gathered subjective reports on thirty (30) participants. We found an evoked potential of vection characterized by a positive peak around 600 ms (P600) after stimulus onset in the parietal region and a simultaneous negative peak in the frontal region. Our results also found participant variability in sensitivity to vection and cybersickness and EEG markers of acceleration across subjects. This result is promising for potential detection of vection using EEG and paves the way for future studies towards a better understanding of vection. It also provides insights into the functional role of the visual system and its integration with the vestibular system during motion-perception. It has the potential to help enhance VR user experience by qualifying users' perceived vection and adapting the VR environments accordingly.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an non-invasive method to record the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG signals are low bandwidth and recorded from multiple electrodes simultaneously in a time synchronized manner. Typical EEG signal processing involves extracting features from all the individual channels separately and then fusing these features for downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a signal transformation, using basic signal processing, to combine the individual channels of a low-bandwidth signal, like the EEG into a single-channel high-bandwidth signal, like audio. Further this signal transformation is bi-directional, namely the high-bandwidth single-channel can be transformed to generate the individual low-bandwidth signals without any loss of information. Such a transformation when applied to EEG signals overcomes the need to process multiple signals and allows for a single-channel processing. The advantage of this signal transformation is that it allows the use of pre-trained single-channel pre-trained models, for multi-channel signal processing and analysis. We further show the utility of the signal transformation on publicly available EEG dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding neural visual representations from electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain activity is crucial for advancing brain-machine interfaces (BMI) and has transformative potential for neural sensory rehabilitation. While multimodal contrastive representation learning (MCRL) has shown promise in neural decoding, existing methods often overlook semantic consistency and completeness within modalities and lack effective semantic alignment across modalities. This limits their ability to capture the complex representations of visual neural responses. We propose Neural-MCRL, a novel framework that achieves multimodal alignment through semantic bridging and cross-attention mechanisms, while ensuring completeness within modalities and consistency across modalities. Our framework also features the Neural Encoder with Spectral-Temporal Adaptation (NESTA), a EEG encoder that adaptively captures spectral patterns and learns subject-specific transformations. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in visual decoding accuracy and model generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods, advancing the field of EEG-based neural visual representation decoding in BMI.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Monitoring fatigue is essential for improving safety, particularly for people who work long shifts or in high-demand workplaces. The development of wearable technologies, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, has made it possible to continuously analyze physiological signals in real-time to determine a person level of exhaustion. This has allowed for timely insights into preventing hazards associated with fatigue. This review focuses on wearable technology and artificial intelligence (AI) integration for tiredness detection, adhering to the PRISMA principles. Studies that used signal processing methods to extract pertinent aspects from physiological data, such as ECG, EMG, and EEG, among others, were analyzed as part of the systematic review process. Then, to find patterns of weariness and indicators of impending fatigue, these features were examined using machine learning and deep learning models. It was demonstrated that wearable technology and cutting-edge AI methods could accurately identify weariness through multi-modal data analysis. By merging data from several sources, information fusion techniques enhanced the precision and dependability of fatigue evaluation. Significant developments in AI-driven signal analysis were noted in the assessment, which should improve real-time fatigue monitoring while requiring less interference. Wearable solutions powered by AI and multi-source data fusion present a strong option for real-time tiredness monitoring in the workplace and other crucial environments. These developments open the door for more improvements in this field and offer useful tools for enhancing safety and reducing fatigue-related hazards.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct interaction between the brain and external devices. To concurrently achieve high decoding accuracy and low energy consumption in invasive BCIs, we propose a novel spiking neural network (SNN) framework incorporating local synaptic stabilization (LSS) and channel-wise attention (CA), termed LSS-CA-SNN. LSS optimizes neuronal membrane potential dynamics, boosting classification performance, while CA refines neuronal activation, effectively reducing energy consumption. Furthermore, we introduce SpikeDrop, a data augmentation strategy designed to expand the training dataset thus enhancing model generalizability. Experiments on invasive spiking datasets recorded from two rhesus macaques demonstrated that LSS-CA-SNN surpassed state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) in both decoding accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving 0.80-3.87% performance gains and 14.78-43.86 times energy saving. This study highlights the potential of LSS-CA-SNN and SpikeDrop in advancing invasive BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) spellers are a promising communication tool for individuals with disabilities. This Brain-Computer Interface utilizes scalp potential data from (electroencephalography) EEG electrodes on a subject's head to decode specific letters or arbitrary targets the subject is looking at on a screen. However, deep neural networks for SSVEP spellers often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen subjects, largely due to the high variability in EEG data. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach combining data augmentation and language modeling to enhance the performance of SSVEP spellers. Using the Benchmark dataset from Tsinghua University, we explore various data augmentation techniques, including frequency masking, time masking, and noise injection, to improve the robustness of deep learning models. Additionally, we integrate a language model (CharRNN) with EEGNet to incorporate linguistic context, significantly enhancing word-level decoding accuracy. Our results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 2.9 percent over the baseline, with time masking and language modeling showing the most promise. This work paves the way for more accurate and generalizable SSVEP speller systems, offering improved communication solutions for individuals with disabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Meta-learning, i.e., "learning to learn", is a promising approach to enable efficient BCI classifier training with limited amounts of data. It can effectively use collections of in some way similar classification tasks, with rapid adaptation to new tasks where only minimal data are available. However, applying meta-learning to existing classifiers and BCI tasks requires significant effort. To address this issue, we propose EEG-Reptile, an automated library that leverages meta-learning to improve classification accuracy of neural networks in BCIs and other EEG-based applications. It utilizes the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to adapt neural network classifiers of EEG data to the inter-subject domain, allowing for more efficient fine-tuning for a new subject on a small amount of data. The proposed library incorporates an automated hyperparameter tuning module, a data management pipeline, and an implementation of the Reptile meta-learning algorithm. EEG-Reptile automation level allows using it without deep understanding of meta-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEG-Reptile on two benchmark datasets (BCI IV 2a, Lee2019 MI) and three neural network architectures (EEGNet, FBCNet, EEG-Inception). Our library achieved improvement in both zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios compared to traditional transfer learning approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) help people with severe speech and motor disabilities communicate and interact with their environment using neural activity. This work focuses on the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm of BCIs using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). The RSVP typing task is a recursive task with multiple sequences, where users see only a subset of symbols in each sequence. Extensive research has been conducted to improve classification in the RSVP typing task, achieving fast classification. However, these methods struggle to achieve high accuracy and do not consider the typing mechanism in the learning procedure. They apply binary target and non-target classification without including recursive training. To improve performance in the classification of symbols while controlling the classification speed, we incorporate the typing setup into training by proposing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the RSVP typing task as a POMDP for recursive classification. Experiments show that the proposed approach, MarkovType, results in a more accurate typing system compared to competitors. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that while there is a trade-off between accuracy and speed, MarkovType achieves the optimal balance between these factors compared to other methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent studies have demonstrated that the representations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can exhibit notable similarities to cortical representations when subjected to identical auditory sensory inputs. In these studies, the ability to predict cortical representations is probed by regressing from ANN representations to cortical representations. Building upon this concept, our approach reverses the direction of prediction: we utilize ANN representations as a supervisory signal to train recognition models using noisy brain recordings obtained through non-invasive measurements. Specifically, we focus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where electroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening serve as input. By training an EEG recognition model to predict ANN representations-representations associated with music identification-we observed a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach to developing recognition models for brain recordings in response to external auditory stimuli. It holds promise for advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCI), neural decoding techniques, and our understanding of music cognition. Furthermore, it provides new insights into the relationship between auditory brain activity and ANN representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from immersive, high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations enhances ecological validity and allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios based on individual cognitive states. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into inter-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. EEG data were collected from 52 non-pilot participants conducting flight tasks in an aircraft simulation, after which they reported cognitive workload using the NASA Task Load Index. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload using two feature sets extracted from the EEG data: 1) spectral features (Baseline model), and 2) a combination of spectral and connectivity features (Connectivity model), both within the alpha, beta, and theta band ranges. Results showed that the performance of the Connectivity model surpassed the Baseline model. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provided insights into the most influential workload-predicting features, highlighting the potential dominance of parietal-directed connectivity in managing cognitive workload during simulated flight. Further research on other connectivity metrics and alternative models (such as deep learning) in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the possibility of a real-time BCI for the prediction of workload under safety-critical operational conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a computer. It has been widely used in medical diagnosis, rehabilitation, education, entertainment, etc. Most research so far focuses on making BCIs more accurate and reliable, but much less attention has been paid to their privacy. Developing a commercial BCI system usually requires close collaborations among multiple organizations, e.g., hospitals, universities, and/or companies. Input data in BCIs, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG), contain rich privacy information, and the developed machine learning model is usually proprietary. Data and model transmission among different parties may incur significant privacy threats, and hence privacy protection in BCIs must be considered. Unfortunately, there does not exist any contemporary and comprehensive review on privacy-preserving BCIs. This paper fills this gap, by describing potential privacy threats and protection strategies in BCIs. It also points out several challenges and future research directions in developing privacy-preserving BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, EEG-based BCIs face at least three major challenges in real-world applications: data scarcity and individual differences, adversarial vulnerability, and data privacy. While previous studies have addressed one or two of these issues, simultaneous accommodation of all three challenges remains challenging and unexplored. This paper fills this gap, by proposing an Augmented Robustness Ensemble (ARE) algorithm and integrating it into three privacy protection scenarios (centralized source-free transfer, federated source-free transfer, and source data perturbation), achieving simultaneously accurate decoding, adversarial robustness, and privacy protection of EEG-based BCIs. Experiments on three public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed approach outperformed over 10 classic and state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and robustness in all three privacy-preserving scenarios, even outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. This is the first time that three major challenges in EEG-based BCIs can be addressed simultaneously, significantly improving the practicalness of EEG decoding in real-world BCIs.</td>

Specifically, we evaluated conventional machine learning techniques such as CSP-SVM and LDA-SVM classifiers alongside deep learning architectures such as EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet. Machine learning classifiers exhibited significantly lower precision and recall, indicating limited feature extraction capabilities and poor generalization between imagined speech and idle states. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly EEGNet, achieved the highest accuracy of 0.7080 and an F1 score of 0.6718, demonstrating their enhanced ability in automatic feature extraction and representation learning, essential for capturing complex neurophysiological patterns. These findings highlight the limitations of conventional machine learning approaches in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and advocate for adopting deep learning methodologies to achieve more precise and reliable classification of detecting imagined speech. This foundational research contributes to the development of imagined speech-based BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding aims to reconstruct original stimuli from fMRI signals, providing insights into interpreting mental content. Current approaches rely heavily on subject-specific models due to the complex brain processing mechanisms and the variations in fMRI signals across individuals. Therefore, these methods greatly limit the generalization of models and fail to capture cross-subject commonalities. To address this, we present UniBrain, a unified brain decoding model that requires no subject-specific parameters. Our approach includes a group-based extractor to handle variable fMRI signal lengths, a mutual assistance embedder to capture cross-subject commonalities, and a bilevel feature alignment scheme for extracting subject-invariant features. We validate our UniBrain on the brain decoding benchmark, achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art subject-specific models with extremely fewer parameters. We also propose a generalization benchmark to encourage the community to emphasize cross-subject commonalities for more general brain decoding.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This Dissertation is comprised of two main projects, addressing questions in neuroscience through applications of generative modeling.   Project #1 (Chapter 4) explores how neurons encode features of the external world. I combine Helmholtz's "Perception as Unconscious Inference" -- paralleled by modern generative models like variational autoencoders (VAE) -- with the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. This combination leads to the development of a hierarchical VAE model, which I test for its ability to mimic neurons from the primate visual cortex in response to motion stimuli. Results show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate brain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion inputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner. Collectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding.   Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using simultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates that the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with around half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities. Comparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from fMRI and Ca2+ signals.   The introduction (Chapter 1) is divided similarly to this abstract: sections 1.1 to 1.8 provide background information about Project #1, and sections 1.9 to 1.13 are related to Project #2.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) is commonly employed to study human brain activity, since it offers insight into the relationship between functional fluctuations and human behavior. To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders, with significant impacts on many daily activities and quality of life. It stands as one of the most common mental disorders globally and ranks as the second leading cause of disability. The current diagnostic approach for MDD primarily relies on clinical observations and patient-reported symptoms, overlooking the diverse underlying causes and pathophysiological factors contributing to depression. Therefore, scientific researchers and clinicians must gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MDD. There is growing evidence in neuroscience that depression is a brain network disorder, and the use of neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a significant role in identifying and treating MDD. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques used to study MDD. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to neuroimaging data to help with early mental health disorder detection. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in graph neural networks (GNNs), which are deep neural architectures specifically designed to handle graph-structured data like rs-fMRI. This research aimed to develop an ensemble-based GNN model capable of detecting discriminative features from rs-fMRI images for the purpose of diagnosing MDD. Specifically, we constructed an ensemble model by combining features from multiple brain region segmentation atlases to capture brain complexity and detect distinct features more accurately than single atlas-based models. Further, the effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by assessing its performance on a large multi-site MDD dataset. The best performing model among all folds achieved an accuracy of 75.80%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 61.84%, a precision of 71.29%, and an F1-score of 79.12%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing that centers around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks. Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that play significant roles in determining ESN performance.</td>

One application of fMRI is investigating potential neural features that distinguish people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from healthy controls. The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) facilitates this research through its extensive data-sharing initiative. While ABIDE offers data preprocessed with various atlases, independent component analysis (ICA) for dimensionality reduction remains underutilized. We address this gap by presenting ICA-based resting-state networks (RSNs) from preprocessed scans from ABIDE, now publicly available: https://github.com/SjirSchielen/groupICAonABIDE. These RSNs unveil neural activation clusters without atlas constraints, offering a perspective on ASD analyses that complements the predominantly atlas-based literature.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity, measured through functional MRI (fMRI), into latent hierarchical representations. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using latent diffusion models (LDM) via a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Due to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential steps, the first one providing a rough visual approximation, the second on improving the stimulus prediction via LDM endowed by CLIP embeddings. This work proposes a non-linear deep network to improve fMRI latent space representation, optimizing the dimensionality alike. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset showed that the proposed architecture improved the structural similarity of the reconstructed image by about 2\% with respect to the state-of-the-art model, based on ridge linear transform. The reconstructed image's semantics improved by about 4\%, measured by perceptual similarity, with respect to the state-of-the-art. The noise sensitivity analysis of the LDM showed that the role of the first stage was fundamental to predict the stimulus featuring high structural similarity. Conversely, providing a large noise stimulus affected less the semantics of the predicted stimulus, while the structural similarity between the ground truth and predicted stimulus was very poor. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging non-linear relationships between BOLD signal and the latent representation and two-stage generative AI for optimizing the fidelity of reconstructed visual stimuli from noisy fMRI data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\% to 54.88\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning has recently enabled the decoding of language from the neural activity of a few participants with electrodes implanted inside their brain. However, reliably decoding words from non-invasive recordings remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language.</td>

MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions.</td>

The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target.

No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

We integrate the advantages of the two latest SOTA models, MedNeXt and SwinUNETR, and use Swin Transformer as the encoder and ConvNeXt as the decoder to innovatively design the Swin-NeXt structure. Our model uses the lowest-level feature map of the encoder as Key and Value and uses patient features such as pathology and treatment information as Query to calculate the attention weights in a Cross Attention module. Moreover, we simplify some pre- and post-processing as well as data enhancement methods in 3D image segmentation based on the dynUnet and nnU-net frameworks.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Prostate cancer, a growing global health concern, necessitates precise diagnostic tools, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offering high-resolution soft tissue imaging that significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. Recent advancements in explainable AI and representation learning have significantly improved prostate cancer diagnosis by enabling automated and precise lesion classification. However, existing explainable AI methods, particularly those based on frameworks like generative adversarial networks (GANs), are predominantly developed for natural image generation, and their application to medical imaging often leads to suboptimal performance due to the unique characteristics and complexity of medical image. To address these challenges, our paper introduces three key contributions. First, we propose ProjectedEx, a generative framework that provides interpretable, multi-attribute explanations, effectively linking medical image features to classifier decisions. Second, we enhance the encoder module by incorporating feature pyramids, which enables multiscale feedback to refine the latent space and improves the quality of generated explanations. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both the generator and classifier, demonstrating the clinical relevance and effectiveness of ProjectedEx in enhancing interpretability and supporting the adoption of AI in medical settings.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) imaging is the gold standard for assessing myocardial fibrosis and scarring, with left ventricular (LV) LGE extent predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Despite its importance, routine LGE-based LV scar quantification is hindered by labor-intensive manual segmentation and inter-observer variability. Methods: We propose ScarNet, a hybrid model combining a transformer-based encoder from the Medical Segment Anything Model (MedSAM) with a convolution-based U-Net decoder, enhanced by tailored attention blocks. ScarNet was trained on 552 ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with expert segmentations of myocardial and scar boundaries and tested on 184 separate patients. Results: ScarNet achieved robust scar segmentation in 184 test patients, yielding a median Dice score of 0.912 (IQR: 0.863--0.944), significantly outperforming MedSAM (median Dice = 0.046, IQR: 0.043--0.047) and nnU-Net (median Dice = 0.638, IQR: 0.604--0.661). ScarNet demonstrated lower bias (-0.63%) and coefficient of variation (4.3%) compared to MedSAM (bias: -13.31%, CoV: 130.3%) and nnU-Net (bias: -2.46%, CoV: 20.3%). In Monte Carlo simulations with noise perturbations, ScarNet achieved significantly higher scar Dice (0.892 \pm 0.053, CoV = 5.9%) than MedSAM (0.048 \pm 0.112, CoV = 233.3%) and nnU-Net (0.615 \pm 0.537, CoV = 28.7%). Conclusion: ScarNet outperformed MedSAM and nnU-Net in accurately segmenting myocardial and scar boundaries in LGE images. The model exhibited robust performance across diverse image qualities and scar patterns.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extend angle increase the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.   Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on 7 [18F]-FDG and 7 [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.   Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18 F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Evaluating the performance of a prediction model is a common task in medical statistics. Standard accuracy metrics require the observation of the true outcomes. This is typically not possible in the setting with time-to-event outcomes due to censoring. Interval censoring, the presence of time-varying covariates, and competing risks present additional challenges in obtaining those accuracy metrics. In this study, we propose two methods to deal with interval censoring in a time-varying competing risk setting: a model-based approach and the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) approach, focusing on three key time-dependent metrics: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), Brier score, and expected predictive cross-entropy (EPCE). The evaluation is conducted over a medically relevant time interval of interest, $[t, \Delta t)$. The model-based approach includes all subjects in the risk set, using their predicted risks to contribute to the accuracy metrics. In contrast, the IPCW approach only considers the subset of subjects who are known to be event-free or experience the event within the interval of interest. we performed a simulation study to compare the performance of the two approaches with regard to the three metrics.</td>

Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder symptoms of which includes repetitive behaviour and lack of social and communication skills. Even though these symptoms can be seen very clearly in social but a large number of individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. In this paper, we worked on a methodology for the detection of ASD from a 3-dimensional walking video dataset, utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) classification algorithms and nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction from the dataset. The proposed methodology involves the classification of ASD using a supervised ML classification algorithm and extracting important and relevant features from the dataset using nature-inspired optimization algorithms. We also included the ranking coefficients to find the initial leading particle. This selection of particle significantly reduces the computation time and hence, improves the total efficiency and accuracy for ASD detection. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, we deployed various combinationsalgorithms of classification algorithm and nature-inspired algorithms resulting in an outstanding classification accuracy of $100\%$ using the random forest classification algorithm and gravitational search algorithm for feature selection. The application of the proposed methodology with different datasets would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methodology. Due to high accuracy and less total computation time, the proposed methodology will offer a significant contribution to the medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future research and advancements in ASD diagnosis.</td>
