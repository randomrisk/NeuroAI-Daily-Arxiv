<td style='padding: 4px;'>Future sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks will demand artificial intelligence (AI) agents that are not only autonomous and efficient, but also capable of real-time adaptation in dynamic environments and transparent in their decisionmaking. However, prevailing agentic AI approaches in networking, exhibit significant shortcomings in this regard. Conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based agents lack explainability and often suffer from brittle adaptation, including catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge under non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution for these challenges: Bayesian reasoning via Active Inference (BRAIN) agent. BRAIN harnesses a deep generative model of the network environment and minimizes variational free energy to unify perception and action in a single closed-loop paradigm. We implement BRAIN as O-RAN eXtended application (xApp) on GPU-accelerated testbed and demonstrate its advantages over standard DRL baselines. In our experiments, BRAIN exhibits (i) robust causal reasoning for dynamic radio resource allocation, maintaining slice-specific quality of service (QoS) targets (throughput, latency, reliability) under varying traffic loads, (ii) superior adaptability with up to 28.3% higher robustness to sudden traffic shifts versus benchmarks (achieved without any retraining), and (iii) real-time interpretability of its decisions through human-interpretable belief state diagnostics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic reasoning across multimodal domains. However, their integration with graph-based models of brain connectivity remains limited. In addition, most existing fMRI analysis methods rely on static Functional Connectivity (FC) representations, which obscure transient neural dynamics critical for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Recent state-space approaches, including Mamba, model temporal structure efficiently, but are typically used as standalone feature extractors without explicit high-level reasoning. We propose NeuroMambaLLM, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic latent graph learning and selective state-space temporal modelling with LLMs. The proposed method learns the functional connectivity dynamically from raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) time series, replacing fixed correlation graphs with adaptive latent connectivity while suppressing motion-related artifacts and capturing long-range temporal dependencies. The resulting dynamic brain representations are projected into the embedding space of an LLM model, where the base language model remains frozen and lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are trained for parameter-efficient alignment. This design enables the LLM to perform both diagnostic classification and language-based reasoning, allowing it to analyze dynamic fMRI patterns and generate clinically meaningful textual reports.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generative models have emerged as powerful tools in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as segmentation, anomaly detection, and high-quality synthetic data generation. These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Fine-tuning large pretrained language models (LLMs) is a cornerstone of modern NLP, yet its growing memory demands (driven by backpropagation and large optimizer States) limit deployment in resource-constrained settings. Zero-order (ZO) methods bypass backpropagation by estimating directional derivatives from forward evaluations, offering substantial memory savings. However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates. We develop a practical algorithm implementing this idea and provide a theoretical analysis, showing that learned sampling distributions improve the quality of gradient information and relax the explicit dependence on $d$ in convergence bounds. Empirically, we validate the approach on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, demonstrating substantially improved performance compared to standard ZO baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive direction sampling is a promising route to make ZO fine-tuning viable at scale. The source code is available at https://github.com/brain-lab-research/zo_ldsd</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $β$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $β$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation.</td>

The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroimaging has profoundly enhanced our understanding of the human brain by characterizing its structure, function, and connectivity through modalities like MRI, fMRI, EEG, and PET. These technologies have enabled major breakthroughs across the lifespan, from early brain development to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite these advances, the brain is a complex, multiscale system, and neuroimaging measurements are correspondingly high-dimensional. This creates major statistical challenges, including measurement noise, motion-related artifacts, substantial inter-subject and site/scanner variability, and the sheer scale of modern studies. This paper explores statistical opportunities and challenges in neuroimaging across four key areas: (i) brain development from birth to age 20, (ii) the adult and aging brain, (iii) neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders, and (iv) brain encoding and decoding. After a quick tutorial on major imaging technologies, we review cutting-edge studies, underscore data and modeling challenges, and highlight research opportunities for statisticians. We conclude by emphasizing that close collaboration among statisticians, neuroscientists, and clinicians is essential for translating neuroimaging advances into improved diagnostics, deeper mechanistic insight, and more personalized treatments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The detection of interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) is crucial for the diagnosis of epilepsy, but automated methods often lack interpretability. This study proposes IED-RAG, an explainable multimodal framework for joint IED detection and report generation. Our approach employs a dual-encoder to extract electrophysiological and semantic features, aligned via contrastive learning in a shared EEG-text embedding space. During inference, clinically relevant EEG-text pairs are retrieved from a vector database as explicit evidence to condition a large language model (LLM) for the generation of evidence-based reports. Evaluated on a private dataset from Wuhan Children's Hospital and the public TUH EEG Events Corpus (TUEV), the framework achieved balanced accuracies of 89.17\% and 71.38\%, with BLEU scores of 89.61\% and 64.14\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that retrieval of explicit evidence enhances both diagnostic performance and clinical interpretability compared to standard black-box methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Driving fatigue is a major contributor to traffic accidents and poses a serious threat to road safety. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measurement of neural activity, yet EEG-based fatigue recognition is hindered by strong non-stationarity and asymmetric neural dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose DeltaGateNet, a novel framework that explicitly captures Bidirectional temporal dynamics for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition. Our key idea is to introduce a Bidirectional Delta module that decomposes first-order temporal differences into positive and negative components, enabling explicit modeling of asymmetric neural activation and suppression patterns. Furthermore, we design a Gated Temporal Convolution module to capture long-term temporal dependencies for each EEG channel using depthwise temporal convolutions and residual learning, preserving channel-wise specificity while enhancing temporal representation robustness. Extensive experiments conducted under both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation settings on the public SEED-VIG and SADT driving fatigue datasets demonstrate that DeltaGateNet consistently outperforms existing methods. On SEED-VIG, DeltaGateNet achieves an intra-subject accuracy of 81.89% and an inter-subject accuracy of 55.55%. On the balanced SADT 2022 dataset, it attains intra-subject and inter-subject accuracies of 96.81% and 83.21%, respectively, while on the unbalanced SADT 2952 dataset, it achieves 96.84% intra-subject and 84.49% inter-subject accuracy. These results indicate that explicitly modeling Bidirectional temporal dynamics yields robust and generalizable performance under varying subject and class-distribution conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tasks ranging from sleep staging to clinical diagnosis traditionally rely on standard polysomnography (PSG) devices, bedside monitors and wearable devices, which capture diverse nocturnal biosignals (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG, SpO$_2$). However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \textit{Demography, Age, Site \& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Selective auditory attention decoding aims to identify the speaker of interest from listeners' neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), in the presence of multiple concurrent speakers. Most existing methods operate at the window level, facing a trade-off between temporal resolution and decoding accuracy. Recent work has shown that hidden Markov model (HMM)-based post-processing can smooth window-level decoder outputs to improve this trade-off. Instead of using a separate smoothing step, we propose to integrate the decoding and smoothing components into a single probabilistic framework using a Markov switching model (MSM). It directly models the relationship between the EEG and speech envelopes under each attention state while incorporating the temporal dynamics of attention. This formulation enables sample-level attention decoding, with model parameters and attention states jointly estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated MSM formulation achieves comparable decoding accuracy to HMM post-processing while providing faster attention switch detection. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/YYao-42/MSM.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Soft robotics has emerged as a versatile field with applications across various domains, from healthcare to industrial automation, and more recently, art and interactive installations. The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroimaging has profoundly enhanced our understanding of the human brain by characterizing its structure, function, and connectivity through modalities like MRI, fMRI, EEG, and PET. These technologies have enabled major breakthroughs across the lifespan, from early brain development to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite these advances, the brain is a complex, multiscale system, and neuroimaging measurements are correspondingly high-dimensional. This creates major statistical challenges, including measurement noise, motion-related artifacts, substantial inter-subject and site/scanner variability, and the sheer scale of modern studies. This paper explores statistical opportunities and challenges in neuroimaging across four key areas: (i) brain development from birth to age 20, (ii) the adult and aging brain, (iii) neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders, and (iv) brain encoding and decoding. After a quick tutorial on major imaging technologies, we review cutting-edge studies, underscore data and modeling challenges, and highlight research opportunities for statisticians. We conclude by emphasizing that close collaboration among statisticians, neuroscientists, and clinicians is essential for translating neuroimaging advances into improved diagnostics, deeper mechanistic insight, and more personalized treatments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG (iEEG) is essential for epilepsy surgery but is challenged by complex spatiotemporal seizure dynamics. We propose SpaTeoGL, a spatiotemporal graph learning framework for interpretable seizure network analysis. SpaTeoGL jointly learns window-level spatial graphs capturing interactions among iEEG electrodes and a temporal graph linking time windows based on similarity of their spatial structure. The method is formulated within a smooth graph signal processing framework and solved via an alternating block coordinate descent algorithm with convergence guarantees. Experiments on a multicenter iEEG dataset with successful surgical outcomes show that SpaTeoGL is competitive with a baseline based on horizontal visibility graphs and logistic regression, while improving non-SOZ identification and providing interpretable insights into seizure onset and propagation dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Unilateral limb motor imagery (MI) plays an important role in upper-limb motor rehabilitation and precise control of external devices, and places higher demands on spatial resolution. However, most existing public datasets focus on binary- or four-class left-right limb paradigms that mainly exploit coarse hemispheric lateralization, and there is still a lack of multimodal datasets that simultaneously record EEG and fNIRS for unilateral multi-directional MI. To address this gap, we constructed MIND, a public motor imagery fNIRS-EEG dataset based on a four-class directional MI paradigm of the right upper limb. The dataset includes 64-channel EEG recordings (1000 Hz) and 51-channel fNIRS recordings (47.62 Hz) from 30 participants (12 females, 18 males; aged 19.0-25.0 years). We analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG spectral power and hemodynamic responses, and validate the potential advantages of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCIs in terms of classification accuracy. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the evaluation and comparison of neuroimaging analysis and decoding methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) underpins neuroscience, clinical neurophysiology, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), yet pronounced inter- and intra-subject variability limits reliability, reproducibility, and translation. This systematic review studies that quantified or modeled EEG variability across resting-state, event-related potentials (ERPs), and task-related/BCI paradigms (including motor imagery and SSVEP) in healthy and clinical cohorts. Across paradigms, inter-subject differences are typically larger than within-subject fluctuations, but both affect inference and model generalization. Stability is feature-dependent: alpha-band measures and individual alpha peak frequency are often relatively reliable, whereas higher-frequency and many connectivity-derived metrics show more heterogeneous reliability; ERP reliability varies by component, with P300 measures frequently showing moderate-to-good stability. We summarize major sources of variability (biological, state-related, technical, and analytical), review common quantification and modeling approaches (e.g., ICC, CV, SNR, generalizability theory, and multivariate/learning-based methods), and provide recommendations for study design, reporting, and harmonization. Overall, EEG variability should be treated as both a practical constraint to manage and a meaningful signal to leverage for precision neuroscience and robust neurotechnology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurately monitoring cognitive load in real time is critical for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that adapt to user engagement and support personalized learning. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive, cost-effective modality for capturing neural activity, though traditional methods often struggle with cross-subject variability and task-specific preprocessing. We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression. These results position BFMs as efficient and interpretable tools for continuous cognitive load monitoring in real-world BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play important and complementary roles in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, compared to the low cost and portability of EEG, MEG is more expensive and less portable, which severely limits the practical application of MEG in BCI systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity recorded by implanted electrodes is a major challenge for invasive Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as decoders trained on data from one session often fail to generalize to subsequent sessions. This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.</td>

Through a 22-month longitudinal deployment with one participant, we used iterative co-design to develop a system for everyday at-home use and documented how it evolved to meet changing needs.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic reasoning across multimodal domains. However, their integration with graph-based models of brain connectivity remains limited. In addition, most existing fMRI analysis methods rely on static Functional Connectivity (FC) representations, which obscure transient neural dynamics critical for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Recent state-space approaches, including Mamba, model temporal structure efficiently, but are typically used as standalone feature extractors without explicit high-level reasoning. We propose NeuroMambaLLM, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic latent graph learning and selective state-space temporal modelling with LLMs. The proposed method learns the functional connectivity dynamically from raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) time series, replacing fixed correlation graphs with adaptive latent connectivity while suppressing motion-related artifacts and capturing long-range temporal dependencies. The resulting dynamic brain representations are projected into the embedding space of an LLM model, where the base language model remains frozen and lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are trained for parameter-efficient alignment. This design enables the LLM to perform both diagnostic classification and language-based reasoning, allowing it to analyze dynamic fMRI patterns and generate clinically meaningful textual reports.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) can provide a more complete view of brain function by merging high temporal and spatial resolutions. High-field ($\geq$3T) systems are standard, and require technical trade-offs, including artifacts in the EEG signal, reduced compatibility with metallic implants, high acoustic noise, and artifacts around high-susceptibility areas such as the optic nerve and nasal sinus. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 0.55T in a visual task. We characterize the gradient and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts inherent to this environment and observe reduced BCG magnitude consistent with the expected scaling of pulse-related artifacts with static magnetic field strength. This reduction shows promise for facilitating effective denoising while preserving the alpha rhythm and signal integrity. Furthermore, we tested a multimodal integration pipeline and demonstrated that the EEG power envelope corresponds with the hemodynamic BOLD response, supporting the potential to measure neurovascular coupling in this environment. We demonstrate that combined EEG-fMRI at 0.55T is feasible and represents a promising environment for multimodal neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To be practical for real-life applications, models for brain-computer interfaces must be easily and quickly deployable on new subjects, effective on affordable scanning hardware, and small enough to run locally on accessible computing resources. To directly address these current limitations, we introduce ENIGMA, a multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG)-to-Image decoding model that reconstructs seen images from EEG recordings and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the research-grade THINGS-EEG2 and consumer-grade AllJoined-1.6M benchmarks, while fine-tuning effectively on new subjects with as little as 15 minutes of data. ENIGMA boasts a simpler architecture and requires less than 1% of the trainable parameters necessary for previous approaches. Our approach integrates a subject-unified spatio-temporal backbone along with a set of multi-subject latent alignment layers and an MLP projector to map raw EEG signals to a rich visual latent space. We evaluate our approach using a broad suite of image reconstruction metrics that have been standardized in the adjacent field of fMRI-to-Image research, and we describe the first EEG-to-Image study to conduct extensive behavioral evaluations of our reconstructions using human raters. Our simple and robust architecture provides a significant performance boost across both research-grade and consumer-grade EEG hardware, and a substantial improvement in fine-tuning efficiency and inference cost. Finally, we provide extensive ablations to determine the architectural choices most responsible for our performance gains in both single and multi-subject cases across multiple benchmark datasets. Collectively, our work provides a substantial step towards the development of practical brain-computer interface applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive brain disorder classification by capturing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines. Our findings advocate for a shift toward end-to-end temporal modeling in fMRI analysis to better capture complex brain dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/DeCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how humans and artificial intelligence systems process complex narrative videos is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent work has shown that scaling large language models (LLMs) improves their alignment with human brain activity, yet it remains unclear what drives these gains and which representational properties are responsible. Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, with $\ell_α\ne\ell_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell_α\ell_β\big)\propto\big| η_{βα} \big|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard. Code, model weights, and instructions are available at https://github.com/neural-processing-lab/MEG-XL .</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play important and complementary roles in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, compared to the low cost and portability of EEG, MEG is more expensive and less portable, which severely limits the practical application of MEG in BCI systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.</td>

A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls.

While a number of existing datasets align brain data with speech and with speech transcripts, no datasets have annotated brain data with sentiment. To bridge this gap, we explore the use of pre-trained Text-to-Sentiment models to annotate non invasive brain recordings, acquired using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants listened to audiobooks. Having annotated the text, we employ force-alignment of the text and audio to align our sentiment labels with the brain recordings. It is straightforward then to train Brainto-Sentiment models on these data. Experimental results show an improvement in balanced accuracy for Brain-to-Sentiment compared to baseline, supporting the proposed approach as a proof-of-concept for leveraging existing MEG datasets and learning to decode sentiment directly from the brain.</td>

Three configurations were employed recording magnetocardiography (MCG) signals in various shielded and unshielded environments. The signals were averaged over a few hundreds up to several thousands of heart beats to detect the MCG traces. The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</td>

Existing neuroimaging techniques, including EEG, MEG, and fMRI, are limited by trade-offs in sensitivity and spatial or temporal resolution. Here we propose quantum sensing MRI (qsMRI), a noninvasive approach that enables direct detection of neuronal firing-induced magnetic fields using a clinical MRI system. qsMRI exploits endogenous proton (1H) nuclear spins in water molecules as intrinsic quantum sensors and decodes time-resolved phase information from free induction decay (FID) signals to infer neuronal magnetic fields. We validate qsMRI through simulations, phantom experiments, and human studies at rest and during motor tasks, and provide open experimental procedures to facilitate independent validation. We further present a case study demonstrating potential applications to neurological disorders. qsMRI represents a first-in-human application of quantum sensing on a clinical MRI platform, establishes a non-BOLD functional imaging modality, and enables interrogation of neuronal firing dynamics in both cortical and deep brain regions.</td>

MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals. These findings show that pretrained vision models applied to image-based MEG representations can effectively capture the structure of imagined speech in non-invasive neural signals.</td>

However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.</td>

Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</td>

A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) show promise for healthcare question answering, but clinical use is limited by weak verification, insufficient evidence grounding, and unreliable confidence signalling. We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI.</td>

This framework generalizes the recently introduced (crisp) aura topological spaces to the fuzzy setting. We define the fuzzy aura-closure operator and the fuzzy aura-interior operator, and prove that the closure is a fuzzy additive Čech closure operator whose transfinite iteration yields a fuzzy Kuratowski closure. Five classes of generalized fuzzy open sets are introduced, and a complete hierarchy among them is established with counterexamples separating all distinct classes. Fuzzy aura-continuity and its decompositions are studied. Separation axioms and fuzzy aura-regularity are introduced. Fuzzy aura-based lower and upper approximation operators are defined, generalizing both the crisp aura rough set model and the Dubois-Prade fuzzy rough set model. A novel FA-MCDM algorithm is proposed and applied to a medical diagnosis problem with comprehensive sensitivity analysis.</td>

A key challenge, however, is that AI reasoning frequently diverges from structured clinical frameworks, limiting trust, interpretability, and adoption.

Existing post hoc explanation methods provide limited transparency and lack formal guarantees. To address this, we leverage formal abductive explanations, which offer consistent, guaranteed reasoning over minimal sufficient feature sets. This enables a clear understanding of AI decision-making and allows alignment with clinical reasoning. Our approach preserves predictive accuracy while providing clinically actionable insights, establishing a robust framework for trustworthy AI in medical diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method.</td>

In this model, the ``direct contact'' paradigm of classical SIR models is replaced by a gauge-mediated interaction where the environment, represented by a pathogen field $\varphi$, plays a fundamental role in the epidemic dynamics. In this model, the non-local characteristics of epidemics appear naturally by integrating out the pathogen field. Utilizing the Doi-Peliti formalism, we derive the effective action of the system and the standard Feynman rules that can be used to compute perturbatively any observables. Using standard QED techniques, we show how to relate renormalized pathogen mass, Debye screening, to epidemiological concepts and we compute at first order the effective reproductive number,$R_{eff}$, and how the condition to have an epidemic is related to a phase transition in the pathogen mass. We show that the superspreading hosts can be included easily in this formalism.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generative models have emerged as powerful tools in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as segmentation, anomaly detection, and high-quality synthetic data generation. These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) is a sensitive tool for assessing small-fiber damage in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), yet the development of robust, automated deep learning-based diagnostic models is limited by scarce labelled data and fine-grained variability in corneal nerve morphology. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data. When used to train automated diagnostic models, the synthetic dataset improves downstream diagnostic accuracy by 2.1% and segmentation performance by 2.2%, validating the framework's potential to alleviate data bottlenecks in medical AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In safety-critical applications such as medical image segmentation, prediction systems must provide reliability guarantees that extend beyond conventional expected loss control. While risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) offer probabilistic guarantees on the expected risk, they fail to capture tail behavior and worst-case scenarios that are crucial in high-stakes settings. This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate. Experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across various risk measures and reliability configurations, while OCE-CRC fails to provide probabilistic guarantees.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks remain a critical challenge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis.</td>
