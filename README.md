<td style='padding: 4px;'>Harmonization of T1-weighted MR images across different scanners is crucial for ensuring consistency in neuroimaging studies. This study introduces a novel approach to direct image harmonization, moving beyond feature standardization to ensure that extracted features remain inherently reliable for downstream analysis. Our method enables image transfer in two ways: (1) mapping images to a scanner-free space for uniform appearance across all scanners, and (2) transforming images into the domain of a specific scanner used in model training, embedding its unique characteristics. Our approach presents strong generalization capability, even for unseen scanners not included in the training phase. We validated our method using MR images from diverse cohorts, including healthy controls, traveling subjects, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model's effectiveness is tested in multiple applications, such as brain age prediction (R2 = 0.60 \pm 0.05), biomarker extraction, AD classification (Test Accuracy = 0.86 \pm 0.03), and diagnosis prediction (AUC = 0.95). In all cases, our harmonization technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in both reliability and predictive accuracy. Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for extensive preprocessing steps, such as skull-stripping, which can introduce errors by misclassifying brain and non-brain structures. This makes our method particularly suitable for applications that require full-head analysis, including research on head trauma and cranial deformities. Additionally, our harmonization model does not require retraining for new datasets, allowing smooth integration into various neuroimaging workflows. By ensuring scanner-invariant image quality, our approach provides a robust and efficient solution for improving neuroimaging studies across diverse settings. The code is available at this link.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The dawn of embodied intelligence has ushered in an unprecedented imperative for resilient, cognition-enabled multi-agent collaboration across next-generation ecosystems, revolutionizing paradigms in autonomous manufacturing, adaptive service robotics, and cyber-physical production architectures. However, current robotic systems face significant limitations, such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1) Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular, plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills; and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow, RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory. Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios, demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments. Project website: https://github.com/FlagOpen/RoboOS</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Fractional anisotropy (FA) and directionally encoded colour (DEC) maps are essential for evaluating white matter integrity and structural connectivity in neuroimaging. However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and tractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive models. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency corrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is inserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to estimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is corrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are investigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the reconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the repetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency estimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation effectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six subjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust phase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for scanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo navigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent tSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove to be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision motion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS, provides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo times. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo navigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D fMRI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Brain tumor segmentation has a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Accurate brain tumor segmentation remains challenging due to their irregular shapes, vague boundaries, and high variability. Objective: We propose a brain tumor segmentation method that combines deep learning with prior knowledge derived from a region-growing algorithm. Methods: The proposed method utilizes a multi-scale feature fusion (MSFF) module and adaptive attention mechanisms (AAM) to extract multi-scale features and capture global contextual information. To enhance the model's robustness in low-confidence regions, the Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout) strategy is employed for uncertainty estimation. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art methods. On the BraTS2021 dataset, the test Dice scores are 89.18% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) segmentation, 93.67% for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation, and 91.23% for Tumor Core (TC) segmentation. On the BraTS2019 validation set, the validation Dice scores are 87.43%, 90.92%, and 90.40% for ET, WT, and TC segmentation, respectively. Ablation studies further confirmed the contribution of each module to segmentation accuracy, indicating that each component played a vital role in overall performance improvement. Conclusion: This study proposed a novel 3D brain tumor segmentation network based on the U-Net architecture. By incorporating the prior knowledge and employing the uncertainty estimation method, the robustness and performance were improved.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neurofeedback training (NFT) aims to teach self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback, but suffers from highly variable outcomes and poorly understood mechanisms, hampering its validation. To address these issues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using Active Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and learning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables us to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker validity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations show that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to prior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also reveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance. This approach provides a tool for assessing and predicting NFT variability, interpret empirical data, and potentially develop personalized training protocols.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential for studying brain development in utero. The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new task alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset. Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler characteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods, most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans. However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores, highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with high-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting reliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial role. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site, had smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically robust and generalizable AI tools.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern.Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying preictal states -- periods during which seizures are more likely to occur -- remains a central challenge in clinical computational neuroscience. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that embeds functional brain connectivity networks, derived from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work presents xEEGNet, a novel, compact, and explainable neural network for EEG data analysis. It is fully interpretable and reduces overfitting through major parameter reduction. As an applicative use case, we focused on classifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological conditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a simple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and gradually modified to move from a "black box" to a more transparent model, without compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined from a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants, including ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG representations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to quantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through training-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168 parameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability, resists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and reduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded EEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between test set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from training data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn band-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for performance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally effective in EEG pathology classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper explores silent speech decoding in active brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which offer more natural and flexible communication than traditional BCI applications. We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The random vector functional link (RVFL) neural network has shown significant potential in overcoming the constraints of traditional artificial neural networks, such as excessive computation time and suboptimal solutions. However, RVFL faces challenges when dealing with noise and outliers, as it assumes all data samples contribute equally. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust framework, R2VFL, RVFL with Huber weighting function and class probability, which enhances the model's robustness and adaptability by effectively mitigating the impact of noise and outliers in the training data. The Huber weighting function reduces the influence of outliers, while the class probability mechanism assigns less weight to noisy data points, resulting in a more resilient model. We explore two distinct approaches for calculating class centers within the R2VFL framework: the simple average of all data points in each class and the median of each feature, the later providing a robust alternative by minimizing the effect of extreme values. These approaches give rise to two novel variants of the model-R2VFL-A and R2VFL-M. We extensively evaluate the proposed models on 47 UCI datasets, encompassing both binary and multiclass datasets, and conduct rigorous statistical testing, which confirms the superiority of the proposed models. Notably, the models also demonstrate exceptional performance in classifying EEG signals, highlighting their practical applicability in real-world biomedical domain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Within-frequency coupling (WFC) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in brain networks reflect neural synchronization within the same frequency band and cross-band oscillatory interactions, respectively. Their synergy provides a comprehensive understanding of neural mechanisms underlying cognitive states such as emotion. However, existing multi-channel EEG studies often analyze WFC or CFC separately, failing to fully leverage their complementary properties. This study proposes a dual-branch graph neural network (DB-GNN) to jointly identify within- and cross-frequency coupled brain networks. Firstly, DBGNN leverages its unique dual-branch learning architecture to efficiently mine global collaborative information and local cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling information. Secondly, to more fully perceive the global information of cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling, the global perception branch of DB-GNN adopts a Transformer architecture. To prevent overfitting of the Transformer architecture, this study integrates prior within- and cross-frequency coupling information into the Transformer inference process, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of DB-GNN. Finally, a multi-scale graph contrastive learning regularization term is introduced to constrain the global and local perception branches of DB-GNN at both graph-level and node-level, enhancing its joint perception ability and further improving its generalization performance. Experimental validation on the emotion recognition dataset shows that DB-GNN achieves a testing accuracy of 97.88% and an F1- score of 97.87%, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has demonstrated the possibility of restoring brain-controlled walking in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the Riemannian minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier for all kinds of EEG-based brain--computer interfaces (BCIs). This classifier is simple, fully deterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to transfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation of a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior.

We present a neuroadaptive haptics system that adapts XR feedback through reinforcement learning (RL) from explicit user ratings and brain-decoded neural signals. In a user study, participants interacted with virtual objects in VR while Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. An RL agent adjusted haptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural decoder. Results show that the RL agent's performance was comparable across feedback sources, suggesting that implicit neural feedback can effectively guide personalization without requiring active user input.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the brain and external equipment through EEG, which is preferred for its superior temporal resolution. Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</td>

We present the Set-And-Forget EEG (SAFE) system, a custom-built amplifier and wireless transmitter meeting these criteria. This compact (12x12 mm), six-channel device offers 1024 Hz sampling and Bluetooth Low Energy data transmission. Validation using generated sinusoids and electrocorticography recordings of visual evoked potentials in sheep models demonstrated low noise recording. Future animal studies will assess sub-scalp EEG signal quality for BCI applications.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency corrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is inserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to estimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is corrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are investigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the reconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the repetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency estimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation effectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six subjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust phase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for scanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo navigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent tSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove to be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision motion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS, provides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo times. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo navigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D fMRI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.</td>

Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment. However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods. Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to 7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord neuroimaging group analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional insights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics. Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting disease states from functional brain connectivity is critical for the early diagnosis of severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals. However, recent neuroscience studies found that such node-based connectivity does not accurately capture ``functional connections" within the brain. This paper proposes a novel approach to brain network analysis that emphasizes edge functional connectivity (eFC), shifting the focus to inter-edge relationships. Additionally, we introduce a co-embedding technique to integrate edge functional connections effectively. Experimental results on the ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN methods in classifying functional brain networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying areas where the signal is prominent is an important task in image analysis, with particular applications in brain mapping. In this work, we develop confidence regions for spatial excursion sets above and below a given level. We achieve this by treating the confidence procedure as a testing problem at the given level, allowing control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project illustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics. Our code is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are increasingly used to investigate brain activity by leveraging the complementary high spatial and high temporal resolution of fMRI and EEG signals respectively. It remains unclear, however, to what degree these two imaging modalities capture shared information about neural activity. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to predict both task-evoked and spontaneous fMRI signals of motor brain networks from EEG time-varying spectral power using interpretable models trained for individual subjects with Sparse Group Lasso regularization. Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects. These results present great potential for translation to EEG neurofeedback applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency corrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is inserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to estimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is corrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are investigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the reconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the repetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency estimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation effectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six subjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust phase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for scanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo navigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent tSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove to be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision motion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS, provides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo times. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo navigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D fMRI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stent retriever (SR) and aspiration techniques are the standard methods for removing occluded emboli, with evolving technologies improving MT efficiency. However, procedural success remains uncertain. Frictional forces, specifically clot-vessel, clot-SR, and SR-vessel interactions, play a critical role in MT outcomes. This review examines frictional forces during MT and their impact on success, analyzing publications from 2015 to 2025. We focus on studies that calculated friction or retrieval forces using in vitro models. We have also included current trends, limitations, and future perspectives on studying and understanding frictional forces and their implementation into in silico models. Findings indicate that fibrin-rich clots are more difficult to retrieve than red blood cell (RBC)-rich clots due to their higher friction coefficient, three to four times greater, an observation supported by multiple studies. SR-vessel and SR-clot friction also influence MT effectiveness. SR-vessel interaction plays a crucial role in acutely curved vessels, as SR compression reduces its efficiency. In SR-clot interaction, RBC-rich clot fragmentation is linked to relative interaction forces. In summary, obtaining in vivo frictional values remains challenging, and inconsistencies persist in past in vitro studies. Further, a deeper understanding of frictional forces is essential for optimizing MT, improving current SRs, and developing next-generation thrombectomy technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) is widely used across various industries, including surface mount technology in semiconductor manufacturing. One of the key challenges in AOI is optimising inspection tolerances. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on the expertise and intuition of engineers, making it subjective and prone to inconsistency. To address this, we are developing an intelligent, data-driven approach to optimise inspection tolerances in a more objective and consistent manner. Most existing research in this area focuses primarily on minimising false calls, often at the risk of allowing actual defects to go undetected. This oversight can compromise product quality, especially in critical sectors such as medical, defence, and automotive industries. Our approach introduces the use of percentile rank, amongst other logical strategies, to ensure that genuine defects are not overlooked. With continued refinement, our method aims to reach a point where every flagged item is a true defect, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection. Our proof of concept achieved an 18% reduction in false calls at the 80th percentile rank, while maintaining a 100% recall rate. This makes the system both efficient and reliable, offering significant time and cost savings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) significantly degrade image quality and impair quantitative analysis. Conventional mitigation strategies, such as repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, are costly and workflow-intensive. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model tailored for MRI motion artifact correction. Methods: Res-MoCoDiff incorporates a novel residual error shifting mechanism in the forward diffusion process, aligning the noise distribution with motion-corrupted data and enabling an efficient four-step reverse diffusion. A U-net backbone enhanced with Swin-Transformer blocks conventional attention layers, improving adaptability across resolutions. Training employs a combined l1+l2 loss, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on synthetic dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and on an in-vivo dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and MT-DDPM using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Results: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across all motion severity levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dynamic computed tomography (CT) reconstruction faces significant challenges in addressing motion artifacts, particularly for nonperiodic rapid movements such as cardiac imaging with fast heart rates. Traditional methods struggle with the extreme limited-angle problems inherent in nonperiodic cases. Deep learning methods have improved performance but face generalization challenges. Recent implicit neural representation (INR) techniques show promise through self-supervised deep learning, but have critical limitations: computational inefficiency due to forward-warping modeling, difficulty balancing DVF complexity with anatomical plausibility, and challenges in preserving fine details without additional patient-specific pre-scans. This paper presents a novel INR-based framework, BIRD, for nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction. It addresses these challenges through four key contributions: (1) backward-warping deformation that enables direct computation of each dynamic voxel with significantly reduced computational cost, (2) diffeomorphism-based DVF regularization that ensures anatomically plausible deformations while maintaining representational capacity, (3) motion-compensated analytical reconstruction that enhances fine details without requiring additional pre-scans, and (4) dimensional-reduction design for efficient 4D coordinate encoding. Through various simulations and practical studies, including digital and physical phantoms and retrospective patient data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction with enhanced details and reduced motion artifacts. The proposed framework enables more accurate dynamic CT reconstruction with potential clinical applications, such as one-beat cardiac reconstruction, cinematic image sequences for functional imaging, and motion artifact reduction in conventional CT scans.</td>

Current healthcare monitoring systems for cardiac patients rely heavily on hospitalization, which can be impractical for continuous monitoring. This paper presents a novel IoT-based solution for remote, real-time tracking of critical cardiac metrics, addressing the pressing need for accessible and continuous healthcare, particularly for the aging population in Pakistan. The proposed IoT kit measures essential parameters such as body temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SPO2), and electrocardiography (ECG).   A key innovation of the system is its integration with a cloud-based application, enabling constant remote monitoring and incorporating an alarm mechanism to alert medical professionals for timely intervention, reducing the risk of catastrophic incidents. The system was tested in a clinical environment with 20 participants, demonstrating results closely aligned with those obtained using standard medical devices. The findings validate the system's potential for reliable remote monitoring, offering a significant step forward in proactive cardiac healthcare management. This novel approach combines IoT technology with cloud-based applications to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for reducing unexpected fatalities among cardiac patients.</td>

This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future directions for LLMs in medical settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.</td>
