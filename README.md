<td style='padding: 4px;'>Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks. (The GS-Net toolbox will be released soon.)</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate and generalisable segmentation of stroke lesions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for advancing clinical research, prognostic modelling, and personalised interventions. Although deep learning has improved automated lesion delineation, many existing models are optimised for narrow imaging contexts and generalise poorly to independent datasets, modalities, and stroke stages. Here, we systematically evaluated stroke lesion segmentation using the nnU-Net framework across multiple heterogeneous, publicly available MRI datasets spanning acute and chronic stroke. Models were trained and tested on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T1-weighted MRI, and evaluated on independent datasets. Across stroke stages, models showed robust generalisation, with segmentation accuracy approaching reported inter-rater reliability. Performance varied with imaging modality and training data characteristics. In acute stroke, DWI-trained models consistently outperformed FLAIR-based models, with only modest gains from multimodal combinations. In chronic stroke, increasing training set size improved performance, with diminishing returns beyond several hundred cases. Lesion volume was a key determinant of accuracy: smaller lesions were harder to segment, and models trained on restricted volume ranges generalised poorly. MRI image quality further constrained generalisability: models trained on lower-quality scans transferred poorly, whereas those trained on higher-quality data generalised well to noisier images. Discrepancies between predictions and reference masks were often attributable to limitations in manual annotations. Together, these findings show that automated lesion segmentation can approach human-level performance while identifying key factors governing generalisability and informing the development of lesion segmentation tools.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Geometric uncertainty can degrade treatment quality in radiation therapy. While margins and robust optimization mitigate these effects, they provide only implicit control over clinical goal fulfillment probability. We therefore develop a probabilistic planning framework using a percentile-based optimization function that targets a specified probability of clinical goal fulfillment.   Systematic and random uncertainties were explicitly modeled over full treatment courses. A scenario dose approximation method based on interpolation between a fixed set of doses was used, enabling efficient simulation of treatment courses during optimization. The framework was evaluated on a prostate case treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and a brain case treated with pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. Plans were compared to conventional margin-based and worst-case robust optimization using probabilistic evaluation.   For the prostate case, probabilistic optimization improved organ at risk (OAR) sparing while maintaining target coverage compared to margin-based planning, increasing average OAR goal fulfillment probability by 13.3 percentage points and reducing 90th percentile OAR doses by an average of 3.5~Gy. For the brain case, probabilistic optimization improved target minimum dose passing probabilities (e.g., 88\% vs.~22\% for $D_{95}$) and brainstem maximum dose passing probability (70\% vs.~30\%), while maintaining comparable or improved OAR sparing compared to worst-case optimization.   Probabilistic optimization enables explicit and interpretable control over goal fulfillment probabilities. Combining full treatment course modeling with efficient approximate dose calculation, the proposed framework improved the trade-off between target coverage and OAR sparing compared to conventional planning approaches in both photon and proton therapy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce a two-stage multitask learning framework for analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning. In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accumulation of amyloid beta proteins is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, and is usually accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology. Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the "two-hit vascular hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely utilized in mobile robot localization due to their affordability and ease of integration. However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Low-cost inertial navigation systems (INS) are prone to sensor biases and measurement noise, which lead to rapid degradation of navigation accuracy during global positioning system (GPS) outages. To address this challenge and improve positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GPS/INS fusion network (BGFN) based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). The BGFN architecture integrates a spiking Transformer with a spiking encoder to simultaneously extract spatial features from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and capture their temporal dynamics. By modeling the relationship between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments, the network leverages both current and historical IMU data to estimate vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through real-world field tests and experiments on public datasets. Compared to conventional deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate that BGFN achieves higher accuracy and enhanced reliability in navigation performance, particularly under prolonged GPS outages.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.   We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.   We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.</td>

Therefore, biomechanics and environmental context must be considered to dissect algorithms for behavioral control. This is enabled by leveraging neuromechanical digital twins: computational models that embed artificial neural controllers within realistic body models in simulated environments. Here we review advances in the creation and use of neuromechanical digital twins while also highlighting emerging opportunities for the future. First, we illustrate how neuromechanical models allow researchers to infer hidden biophysical variables that may be difficult to measure experimentally. Additionally, by perturbing these models, one can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses. Next, we explore how neuromechanical twins have been used to foster a deeper exchange between neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning. Finally, we show how neuromechanical twins can advance healthcare. We envision that coupling studies on animals with active probing of their neuromechanical twins will greatly accelerate neuroscientific discovery.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is challenged by pronounced inter-subject variability and the difficulty of learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition. The code has been released at https://github.com/Danielz-z/LGF-EEG-Emotion.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical time series data, such as EEG and ECG, are vital for diagnosing neurological and cardiovascular diseases. However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF. CoDAC offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical time series diagnosis, effectively mitigating data scarcity challenges.</td>

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the gold standard for quantifying mental workload; however, due to its complexity and non-portability, it can be constraining. ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations. Overall, this work is an initiation for building low-cost, explainable, and real-time cognitive monitoring systems for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on ageing and clinical populations.</td>

Common post hoc AI explainers, such as LIME, SHAP, HSIC, and SAGE, are model agnostic but are too restricted in one significant regard: they tend to misrank correlated features and require costly perturbations, which do not scale to high dimensional data. We introduce ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a theoretically grounded, simple, and reliable metric for explaining the contribution of input features to model outputs, which remains stable and consistent under noise and sampling variations. We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient. To this end, we further extend ExCIR with an information theoretic foundation that unifies the correlation ratio with Canonical Correlation Analysis under mutual information bounds, enabling multi output and class conditioned explainability at scale.</td>

Despite the physiological importance of these mechanisms, computational studies rarely synthesize these modalities or identify the neural regions most responsible for sustained focus. To address this gap, this work introduces Gamma2Patterns, a multimodal framework that characterizes deep cognitive attention by leveraging complementary Gamma and Alpha band EEG activity alongside Eye-tracking measurements. Using the SEED-IV dataset [1], we extract spectral power, burst-based temporal dynamics, and fixation-saccade-pupil signals across 62 channels or electrodes to analyze how neural activation differs between high-focus (Gamma-dominant) and low-focus (Alpha-dominant) states. Our findings reveal that frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions exhibit the strongest Gamma power and burst rates, indicating their dominant role in deep attentional engagement, while Eye-tracking signals confirm complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions. Furthermore, we show that Gamma power and burst duration provide more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone, demonstrating their value for attention decoding. Collectively, these results establish a multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing a neurophysiological foundation for future brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.</td>

This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current neural interfaces such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face several fundamental challenges, including frequent recalibration due to neuroplasticity and session-to-session variability, real-time processing latency, limited personalization and generalization across subjects, hardware constraints, surgical risks in invasive systems, and cognitive burden in patients with neurological impairments. These limitations significantly affect the accuracy, stability, and long-term usability of BCIs. This article introduces the concept of the Neural Digital Twin (NDT) as an advanced solution to overcome these barriers. NDT represents a dynamic, personalized computational model of the brain-BCI system that is continuously updated with real-time neural data, enabling prediction of brain states, optimization of control commands, and adaptive tuning of decoding algorithms. The design of NDT draws inspiration from the application of Digital Twin technology in advanced industries such as aerospace and autonomous vehicles, and leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience data acquisition technologies.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a data-driven framework to characterize large-scale brain dynamical states directly from correlation matrices at the single-subject level. By treating correlation thresholding as a percolation-like probe of connectivity, the approach tracks multiple cluster- and network-level observables and identifies a characteristic percolation threshold, rc, at which these signatures converge. We use $r_c$ as an operational and physically interpretable descriptor of large-scale brain dynamical state. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 996), the method yields stable, subject-specific estimates that covary systematically with established dynamical indicators such as temporal autocorrelations. Numerical simulations of a whole-brain model with a known critical regime further show that $r_c$ tracks changes in collective dynamics under controlled variations of excitability. By replacing arbitrary threshold selection with a criterion intrinsic to correlation structure, the r-spectra provides a physically grounded approach for comparing brain dynamical states across individuals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence.</td>

To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate fMRI analysis requires sensitivity to temporal structure across multiple scales, as BOLD signals encode cognitive processes that emerge from fast transient dynamics to slower, large-scale fluctuations. Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes. Experiments on clinical and non-clinical datasets demonstrate that NeuroSSM achieves competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art fMRI analysis methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an indirect measurement of neuronal activity via hemodynamic responses that vary across brain regions and individuals. Ignoring this hemodynamic variability can bias downstream connectivity estimates. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters themselves may serve as important imaging biomarkers. Estimating spatially varying hemodynamics from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is therefore an important but challenging blind inverse problem, since both the latent neural activity and the hemodynamic coupling are unknown. In this work, we propose a methodology for inferring hemodynamic coupling on the cortical surface from rsfMRI. Our approach avoids the highly unstable joint recovery of neural activity and hemodynamics by marginalizing out the latent neural signal and basing inference on the resulting marginal likelihood. To enable scalable, high-resolution estimation, we employ a deep neural network combined with conditional normalizing flows to accurately approximate this intractable marginal likelihood, while enforcing spatial coherence through priors defined on the cortical surface that admit sparse representations. The proposed approach is extensively validated using synthetic data and real fMRI datasets, demonstrating clear improvements over current methods for hemodynamic estimation and downstream connectivity analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We derive an estimator of the spectral density of a functional time series that is the output of a multilayer perceptron neural network. The estimator is motivated by difficulties with the computation of existing spectral density estimators for time series of functions defined on very large grids that arise, for example, in climate compute models and medical scans. Existing estimators use autocovariance kernels represented as large $G \times G$ matrices, where $G$ is the number of grid points on which the functions are evaluated. In many recent applications, functions are defined on 2D and 3D domains, and $G$ can be of the order $G \sim 10^5$, making the evaluation of the autocovariance kernels computationally intensive or even impossible. We use the theory of spectral functional principal components to derive our deep learning estimator and prove that it is a universal approximator to the spectral density under general assumptions. Our estimator can be trained without computing the autocovariance kernels and it can be parallelized to provide the estimates much faster than existing approaches. We validate its performance by simulations and an application to fMRI images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Blind source separation, particularly through independent component analysis (ICA), is widely utilized across various signal processing domains for disentangling underlying components from observed mixed signals, owing to its fully data-driven nature that minimizes reliance on prior assumptions. However, conventional ICA methods rely on an assumption of linear mixing, limiting their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships and to maintain robustness in noisy environments. In this work, we present deep deterministic nonlinear independent component analysis (DDICA), a novel deep neural network-based framework designed to address these limitations. DDICA leverages a matrix-based entropy function to directly optimize the independence criterion via stochastic gradient descent, bypassing the need for variational approximations or adversarial schemes. This results in a streamlined training process and improved resilience to noise. We validated the effectiveness and generalizability of DDICA across a range of applications, including simulated signal mixtures, hyperspectral image unmixing, modeling of primary visual receptive fields, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DDICA effectively separates independent components with high accuracy across a range of applications. These findings suggest that DDICA offers a robust and versatile solution for blind source separation in diverse signal processing tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) are rapidly evolving toward wearable, multimodal, and data-driven, AI-supported neuroimaging in the everyday world. However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a Standard Model (SM) extension where neutrinos get masses through a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism. This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(μ\to e γ)\simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $μ\to eee$ and $μ$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach. Altogether, the radiative origin of neutrino masses links low-energy flavor observables to collider signatures, delineating discovery targets for MEG II, Mu2e/COMET, and the HL-LHC and distinguishing this framework from conventional inverse- and radiative-seesaw models. Moreover, the $Z_3$ guarantees a stable DM candidate, either scalar ($ρ$) or fermionic ($Ω$). Then, here we analyze and identify the viable parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic abundance for both situations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain dynamics dominate every level of neural organization -- from single-neuron spiking to the macroscopic waves captured by fMRI, MEG, and EEG -- yet the mathematical tools used to interrogate those dynamics remain scattered across a patchwork of traditions. Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail. Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery.</td>

In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning, and recent advances have extended this paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep neural networks (DNNs), which support services such as driving assistants and medical diagnoses, undergo lengthy and expensive training procedures. Therefore, the training's outcome - the DNN weights - represents a significant intellectual property asset to protect. Side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently appeared as an effective approach to recover this confidential asset from DNN implementations. In response, researchers have proposed to defend DNN implementations through classic side-channel countermeasures, at the cost of higher energy consumption, inference time, and resource utilisation. Following a different approach, Ding et al. (HOST'25) introduced MACPRUNING, a novel SCA countermeasure based on pruning, a performance-oriented Approximate Computing technique: at inference time, the implementation randomly prunes (or skips) non-important weights (i.e., with low contribution to the DNN's accuracy) of the first layer, exponentially increasing the side-channel resilience of the protected DNN implementation. However, the original security analysis of MACPRUNING did not consider a control-flow dependency intrinsic to the countermeasure design. This dependency may allow an attacker to circumvent MACPRUNING and recover the weights important to the DNN's accuracy. This paper describes a preprocessing methodology to exploit the above-mentioned control-flow dependency. Through practical experiments on a Chipwhisperer-Lite running a MACPRUNING-protected Multi-Layer Perceptron, we target the first 8 weights of each neuron and recover 96% of the important weights, demonstrating the drastic reduction in security of the protected implementation. Moreover, we show how microarchitectural leakage improves the effectiveness of our methodology, even allowing for the recovery of up to 100% of the targeted non-important weights. Lastly, by adapting our methodology [continue in pdf].</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are the most lethal diseases of the aorta. The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The potential for drone delivery services to transform logistics systems and consumer behavior has gained increasing attention. However, comprehensive empirical evidence on consumer delivery choice behavior within the context of transportation and urban air logistics remains limited, particularly in Japan. This study addresses this gap by examining Japanese consumers' preferences and behavioral intentions toward drone delivery services. Using a stated preference (SP) survey and discrete choice modeling approaches, including multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (MMNL) models, the analysis evaluates how delivery cost, delivery time, drop-off location, product type, and social influence affect delivery mode choices across different demographic groups. The results indicate that although consumers express interest in drone delivery, perceived cost and concerns related to reliability continue to constrain adoption. Younger and male consumers exhibit higher preferences for drone delivery, while product type, particularly daily consumer goods and medical or healthcare items, plays a significant role in shaping preferences. Post-estimation willingness-to-pay and elasticity analyses further highlight consumers' sensitivity to delivery pricing and speed attributes. Overall, the findings provide actionable insights for logistics service providers and policymakers regarding pricing strategies, service targeting, and deployment approaches for integrating drone delivery into Japan's evolving logistics system.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Geometric uncertainty can degrade treatment quality in radiation therapy. While margins and robust optimization mitigate these effects, they provide only implicit control over clinical goal fulfillment probability. We therefore develop a probabilistic planning framework using a percentile-based optimization function that targets a specified probability of clinical goal fulfillment.   Systematic and random uncertainties were explicitly modeled over full treatment courses. A scenario dose approximation method based on interpolation between a fixed set of doses was used, enabling efficient simulation of treatment courses during optimization. The framework was evaluated on a prostate case treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and a brain case treated with pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. Plans were compared to conventional margin-based and worst-case robust optimization using probabilistic evaluation.   For the prostate case, probabilistic optimization improved organ at risk (OAR) sparing while maintaining target coverage compared to margin-based planning, increasing average OAR goal fulfillment probability by 13.3 percentage points and reducing 90th percentile OAR doses by an average of 3.5~Gy. For the brain case, probabilistic optimization improved target minimum dose passing probabilities (e.g., 88\% vs.~22\% for $D_{95}$) and brainstem maximum dose passing probability (70\% vs.~30\%), while maintaining comparable or improved OAR sparing compared to worst-case optimization.   Probabilistic optimization enables explicit and interpretable control over goal fulfillment probabilities. Combining full treatment course modeling with efficient approximate dose calculation, the proposed framework improved the trade-off between target coverage and OAR sparing compared to conventional planning approaches in both photon and proton therapy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Echocardiographic diagnosis is vital for cardiac screening yet remains challenging. Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available.</td>

Lightweight architectures typically suffer significant performance loss.

The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While reasoning-enhanced large language models perform strongly on English medical tasks, a persistent multilingual gap remains, with substantially weaker reasoning in local languages, limiting equitable global medical deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-CoReasoner, a language-informed co-reasoning framework that elicits parallel English and local-language reasoning, abstracts them into structured concepts, and integrates local clinical knowledge into an English logical scaffold via concept-level alignment and retrieval. This design combines the structural robustness of English reasoning with the practice-grounded expertise encoded in local languages. To evaluate multilingual medical reasoning beyond multiple-choice settings, we construct MultiMed-X, a benchmark covering seven languages with expert-annotated long-form question answering and natural language inference tasks, comprising 350 instances per language. Experiments across three benchmarks show that Med-CoReasoner improves multilingual reasoning performance by an average of 5%, with particularly substantial gains in low-resource languages. Moreover, model distillation and expert evaluation analysis further confirm that Med-CoReasoner produces clinically sound and culturally grounded reasoning traces.</td>
