<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite major advances in surgical brain-to-text (B2T), i.e. transcribing speech from invasive brain recordings, non-invasive alternatives have yet to surpass even chance on standard metrics. This remains a barrier to building a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines, raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size. Together, our results remove a major obstacle to realising practical non-invasive B2T systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Information theory is a powerful framework for quantifying complexity, uncertainty, and dynamical structure in time-series data, with widespread applicability across disciplines such as physics, finance, and neuroscience. However, the literature on these measures remains fragmented, with domain-specific terminologies, inconsistent mathematical notation, and disparate visualization conventions that hinder interdisciplinary integration. This work addresses these challenges by unifying key information-theoretic time-series measures through shared semantic definitions, standardized mathematical notation, and cohesive visual representations. We compare these measures in terms of their theoretical foundations, computational formulations, and practical interpretability -- mapping them onto a common conceptual space through an illustrative case study with functional magnetic resonance imaging time series in the brain. This case study exemplifies the complementary insights these measures offer in characterizing the dynamics of complex neural systems, such as signal complexity and information flow. By providing a structured synthesis, our work aims to enhance interdisciplinary dialogue and methodological adoption, which is particularly critical for reproducibility and interoperability in computational neuroscience. More broadly, our framework serves as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate and apply information-theoretic time-series measures to diverse complex systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain's intricate connectome, a blueprint for its function, presents immense complexity, yet it arises from a compact genetic code, hinting at underlying low-dimensional organizational principles. This work bridges connectomics and representation learning to uncover these principles. We propose a framework that combines subgraph extraction from the Drosophila connectome, FlyWire, with a generative model to derive interpretable low-dimensional representations of neural circuitry. Crucially, an explainability module links these latent dimensions to specific structural features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly, the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing bio-inspired artificial neural networks.</td>

We present a robust, generalisable defacing pipeline for high-resolution MRI that integrates atlas-based registration with brain masking. Our method was evaluated on 2,566 heterogeneous clinical scans for meningioma and achieved a 99.92 per cent success rate (2,564/2,566) upon visual inspection.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging modality for non-invasive brain stimulation and therapeutic intervention, offering millimeter-scale spatial precision and the ability to target deep brain structures. However, the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the human skull introduces significant distortions to the propagating ultrasound wavefront, which require time-consuming patient-specific planning and corrections using numerical solvers for accurate targeting. To enable data-driven approaches in this domain, we introduce TFUScapes, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of tFUS simulations through anatomically realistic human skulls derived from T1-weighted MRI images. We have developed a scalable simulation engine pipeline using the k-Wave pseudo-spectral solver, where each simulation returns a steady-state pressure field generated by a focused ultrasound transducer placed at realistic scalp locations. In addition to the dataset, we present DeepTFUS, a deep learning model that estimates normalized pressure fields directly from input 3D CT volumes and transducer position. The model extends a U-Net backbone with transducer-aware conditioning, incorporating Fourier-encoded position embeddings and MLP layers to create global transducer embeddings. These embeddings are fused with U-Net encoder features via feature-wise modulation, dynamic convolutions, and cross-attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of spatially weighted and gradient-sensitive loss functions, enabling it to approximate high-fidelity wavefields. The TFUScapes dataset is publicly released to accelerate research at the intersection of computational acoustics, neurotechnology, and deep learning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is essential for studying brain microstructure, but high-resolution imaging remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventional methods often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images. However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics. In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios. Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-inspired computing aims to mimic cognitive functions like associative memory, the ability to recall complete patterns from partial cues. Memristor technology offers promising hardware for such neuromorphic systems due to its potential for efficient in-memory analog computing. Hopfield Neural Networks (HNNs) are a classic model for associative memory, but implementations on conventional hardware suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, while prior memristor-based HNNs faced challenges with vulnerability to hardware defects due to offline training, limited storage capacity, and difficulty processing analog patterns. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate on integrated memristor hardware a new hardware-adaptive learning algorithm for associative memories that significantly improves defect tolerance and capacity, and naturally extends to scalable multilayer architectures capable of handling both binary and continuous patterns. Our approach achieves 3x effective capacity under 50% device faults compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, its extension to multilayer architectures enables superlinear capacity scaling (\(\propto N^{1.49}\ for binary patterns) and effective recalling of continuous patterns (\propto N^{1.74}\ scaling), as compared to linear capacity scaling for previous HNNs. It also provides flexibility to adjust capacity by tuning hidden neurons for the same-sized patterns. By leveraging the massive parallelism of the hardware enabled by synchronous updates, it reduces energy by 8.8x and latency by 99.7% for 64-dimensional patterns over asynchronous schemes, with greater improvements at scale. This promises the development of more reliable memristor-based associative memory systems and enables new applications research due to the significantly improved capacity, efficiency, and flexibility.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article addresses the challenge of modeling the amplitude of spatially indexed low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in resting state functional MRI as a function of cortical structural features and a multi-task coactivation network in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. It proposes a generative model that integrates effects of spatially-varying inputs and a network-valued input using deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear and spatial associations with the output. The method models spatial smoothness, accounts for subject heterogeneity and complex associations between network and spatial images at different scales, enables accurate inference of each images effect on the output image, and allows prediction with uncertainty quantification via Monte Carlo dropout, contributing to one of the first Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks for heterogeneous imaging data. The model is highly scalable to high-resolution data without the heavy pre-processing or summarization often required by Bayesian methods. Empirical results demonstrate its strong performance compared to existing statistical and deep learning methods. We applied the XAI model to the ABCD data which revealed associations between cortical features and ALFF throughout the entire brain. Our model performed comparably to existing methods in predictive accuracy but provided superior uncertainty quantification and faster computation, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale neuroimaging analysis. Open-source software in Python for XAI is available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning is significantly advancing the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data by effectively discovering highly nonlinear patterns within the signals. Data partitioning and cross-validation are crucial for assessing model performance and ensuring study comparability, as they can produce varied results and data leakage due to specific signal properties (e.g., biometric). Such variability leads to incomparable studies and, increasingly, overestimated performance claims, which are detrimental to the field. Nevertheless, no comprehensive guidelines for proper data partitioning and cross-validation exist in the domain, nor is there a quantitative evaluation of their impact on model accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. To assist researchers in identifying optimal experimental strategies, this paper thoroughly investigates the role of data partitioning and cross-validation in evaluating EEG deep learning models. Five cross-validation settings are compared across three supervised cross-subject classification tasks (BCI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease detection) and four established architectures of increasing complexity (ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and Temporal-based ResNet). The comparison of over 100,000 trained models underscores, first, the importance of using subject-based cross-validation strategies for evaluating EEG deep learning models, except when within-subject analyses are acceptable (e.g., BCI). Second, it highlights the greater reliability of nested approaches (N-LNSO) compared to non-nested counterparts, which are prone to data leakage and favor larger models overfitting to validation data. In conclusion, this work provides EEG deep learning researchers with an analysis of data partitioning and cross-validation and offers guidelines to avoid data leakage, currently undermining the domain with potentially overestimated performance claims.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution, existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings, surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded brain decoding in AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As a method to connect human brain and external devices, Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are receiving extensive research attention. Recently, the integration of communication theory with BCI has emerged as a popular trend, offering potential to enhance system performance and shape next-generation communications.   A key challenge in this field is modeling the brain wireless communication channel between intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) emitting neurons and extracranial electroencephalography (EEG) receiving electrodes. However, the complex physiology of brain challenges the application of traditional channel modeling methods, leaving relevant research in its infancy. To address this gap, we propose a frequency-division multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) estimation framework leveraging simultaneous macaque EEG and ECoG recordings, while employing neurophysiology-informed regularization to suppress noise interference. This approach reveals profound similarities between neural signal propagation and multi-antenna communication systems. Experimental results show improved estimation accuracy over conventional methods while highlighting a trade-off between frequency resolution and temporal stability determined by signal duration. This work establish a conceptual bridge between neural interfacing and communication theory, accelerating synergistic developments in both fields.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition through physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an essential aspect of affective computing and provides an objective way to capture human emotions. However, physiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels hinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain adaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues, especially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and unlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level self-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory buffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and pseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling generalization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for emotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for accurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast adaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and effective handling of evolving data streams. Experimental validation on two mainstream EEG tasks demonstrates the framework's ability to adapt to continuous data streams while maintaining strong generalization across subjects, outperforming existing approaches.</td>

We propose a multi-chip ensemble VQC framework that systematically overcomes these hurdles. By partitioning high-dimensional computations across ensembles of smaller, independently operating quantum chips and leveraging controlled inter-chip entanglement boundaries, our approach demonstrably mitigates barren plateaus, enhances generalization, and uniquely reduces both quantum error bias and variance simultaneously without additional mitigation overhead. This allows for robust processing of large-scale data, as validated on standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10) and a real-world PhysioNet EEG dataset, aligning with emerging modular quantum hardware and paving the way for more scalable QML.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) is a neurological condition that occurs in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is marked by suppressed signals just after the seizure before the brain gradually recovers. Recovery from PGES involves a mixed state of amplitude suppression and high-amplitude oscillations, exhibiting a bimodal exponential distribution in power, unlike the unimodal exponential distribution of PGES. In this study, using the subcritical Hopf model, we explain the nature of phase transitions that underlie PGES. Our results reveal that recovery from PGES involves a change from a fixed point state to a bistable state (mixed phase), effectively captured by the noisy fixed-point and bistable regimes of the model. Consistent patterns across patients suggest a universal dynamical signature in PGES recovery. Our findings offer a mechanistic understanding of seizure termination and postictal brain state transitions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite major advances in surgical brain-to-text (B2T), i.e. transcribing speech from invasive brain recordings, non-invasive alternatives have yet to surpass even chance on standard metrics. This remains a barrier to building a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines, raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning is significantly advancing the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data by effectively discovering highly nonlinear patterns within the signals. Data partitioning and cross-validation are crucial for assessing model performance and ensuring study comparability, as they can produce varied results and data leakage due to specific signal properties (e.g., biometric). Such variability leads to incomparable studies and, increasingly, overestimated performance claims, which are detrimental to the field. Nevertheless, no comprehensive guidelines for proper data partitioning and cross-validation exist in the domain, nor is there a quantitative evaluation of their impact on model accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. To assist researchers in identifying optimal experimental strategies, this paper thoroughly investigates the role of data partitioning and cross-validation in evaluating EEG deep learning models. Five cross-validation settings are compared across three supervised cross-subject classification tasks (BCI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease detection) and four established architectures of increasing complexity (ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and Temporal-based ResNet). The comparison of over 100,000 trained models underscores, first, the importance of using subject-based cross-validation strategies for evaluating EEG deep learning models, except when within-subject analyses are acceptable (e.g., BCI). Second, it highlights the greater reliability of nested approaches (N-LNSO) compared to non-nested counterparts, which are prone to data leakage and favor larger models overfitting to validation data. In conclusion, this work provides EEG deep learning researchers with an analysis of data partitioning and cross-validation and offers guidelines to avoid data leakage, currently undermining the domain with potentially overestimated performance claims.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As a method to connect human brain and external devices, Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are receiving extensive research attention. Recently, the integration of communication theory with BCI has emerged as a popular trend, offering potential to enhance system performance and shape next-generation communications.   A key challenge in this field is modeling the brain wireless communication channel between intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) emitting neurons and extracranial electroencephalography (EEG) receiving electrodes. However, the complex physiology of brain challenges the application of traditional channel modeling methods, leaving relevant research in its infancy. To address this gap, we propose a frequency-division multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) estimation framework leveraging simultaneous macaque EEG and ECoG recordings, while employing neurophysiology-informed regularization to suppress noise interference. This approach reveals profound similarities between neural signal propagation and multi-antenna communication systems. Experimental results show improved estimation accuracy over conventional methods while highlighting a trade-off between frequency resolution and temporal stability determined by signal duration. This work establish a conceptual bridge between neural interfacing and communication theory, accelerating synergistic developments in both fields.</td>

We benchmarked traditional classifiers based on engineered features, Long Short-Term Memory networks on raw time-series data, and Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Gramian Angular Field-transformed images. Ensemble models like Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting achieved accuracies above 97 percent, while the ResNet-based CNN reached 95.0 percent accuracy with a near-perfect AUC of 99.2 percent, outperforming both LSTM and EfficientNet architectures. A novel data augmentation strategy was employed to equalize trial durations while preserving physiological integrity. Feature importance analyses revealed that both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signals, particularly slope and RMS metrics, were key contributors to classification performance.

While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has demonstrated the possibility of restoring brain-controlled walking in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate classification of EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetic applications, yet many existing methods fail to account for the non-Euclidean, manifold structure of EEG data, resulting in suboptimal performance. Preserving this manifold information is essential to capture the true geometry of EEG signals, but traditional classification techniques largely overlook this need. To this end, we propose MPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based Classifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2) a clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity. Ensembling multiple clustering-based classifiers, MPEC achieves superior results, validated by significant improvements on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper explores silent speech decoding in active brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which offer more natural and flexible communication than traditional BCI applications. We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Our research advances silent speech decoding in active BCI systems, offering an innovative solution for EEG language model pretraining and a new dataset for fundamental research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How do different brains create unique visual experiences from identical sensory input? While neural representations vary across individuals, the fundamental architecture underlying these differences remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that individual visual experience emerges from a high-dimensional neural geometry across the visual cortical hierarchy. Using spectral decomposition of fMRI responses during naturalistic movie viewing, we find that idiosyncratic neural patterns persist across multiple orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. Remarkably, each dimensional range encodes qualitatively distinct aspects of individual processing, and this multidimensional neural geometry predicts subsequent behavioral differences in memory recall. These fine-grained patterns of inter-individual variability cannot be reduced to those detected by conventional intersubject correlation measures. Our findings demonstrate that subjective visual experience arises from information integrated across an expansive multidimensional manifold. This geometric framework offers a powerful new lens for understanding how diverse brains construct unique perceptual worlds from shared experiences.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The impressive linguistic abilities of large language models (LLMs) have recommended them as models of human sentence processing, with some conjecturing a positive 'quality-power' relationship (Wilcox et al., 2023), in which language models' (LMs') fit to psychometric data continues to improve as their ability to predict words in context increases. This is important because it suggests that elements of LLM architecture, such as veridical attention to context and a unique objective of predicting upcoming words, reflect the architecture of the human sentence processing faculty, and that any inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be attributed to insufficient model complexity, which recedes as larger models become available. Recent studies (Oh and Schuler, 2023) have shown this scaling inverts after a point, as LMs become excessively large and accurate, when word prediction probability (as information-theoretic surprisal) is used as a predictor. Other studies propose the use of entire vectors from differently sized LLMs, still showing positive scaling (Schrimpf et al., 2021), casting doubt on the value of surprisal as a predictor, but do not control for the larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LMs. This study evaluates LLM scaling using entire LLM vectors, while controlling for the larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LLMs. Results show that inverse scaling obtains, suggesting that inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be due to substantial misalignment between LLMs and human sentence processing, which worsens as larger models are used.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional functional connectivity based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can only capture pairwise interactions between brain regions. Hypergraphs, which reveal high-order relationships among multiple brain regions, have been widely used for disease analysis. However, existing methods often rely on predefined hypergraph structures, limiting their ability to model complex patterns. Moreover, temporal information, an essential component of brain high-order relationships, is frequently overlooked. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns informative and sparse high-order brain structures along with their temporal dynamics. Inspired by the information bottleneck principle, we introduce an objective that maximizes information and minimizes redundancy, aiming to retain disease-relevant high-order features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Our model comprises a multi-hyperedge binary mask module for hypergraph structure learning, a hypergraph self-attention aggregation module that captures spatial features through adaptive attention across nodes and hyperedges, and a spatio-temporal low-dimensional network for extracting discriminative spatio-temporal representations for disease classification. Experiments on benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and successfully identifies meaningful high-order brain interactions. These findings provide new insights into brain network modeling and the study of neuropsychiatric disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are prone to intense "burst" noise artifacts due to head movements and other sources. Such volumes can be considered as high-dimensional outliers that can be identified using statistical outlier detection techniques, which allows for controlling the false positive rate. Previous work has used dimension reduction and multivariate outlier detection techniques, including the use of robust minimum covariance determinant (MCD) distances. Under Gaussianity, the distribution of these robust distances can be approximated, and an upper quantile of that distribution can be used to identify outlying volumes. Unfortunately, the Gaussian assumption is unrealistic for fMRI data in this context. One way to address this is to transform the data to Normality. A limitation of existing robust methods for this purpose, such as robust Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations, is that they can deal with skew but not heavy or light tails. Here, we develop a novel robust method for transformation to central Normality based on the highly flexible sinh-arcsinh (SHASH) family of distributions. To avoid the influence of outliers, it is crucial to initialize the outlier labels with a high degree of sensitivity. For this purpose, we consider a commonplace robust z-score approach, and a modified isolation forest (iForest) approach, a popular technique for anomaly detection in machine learning. Through extensive simulation studies, we find that our proposed SHASH transformation initialized using iForest clearly outperforms benchmark methods in a variety of settings, including skewed and heavy tailed distributions, and light to heavy outlier contamination. We also apply the proposed techniques to several example datasets and find this combination to have consistently strong performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding thoughts from brain activity offers valuable insights into human cognition and enables promising applications in brain-computer interaction. While prior studies have explored language reconstruction from fMRI data, they are typically limited to single-modality inputs such as images or audio. In contrast, human thought is inherently multimodal. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified and flexible framework for reconstructing coherent language from brain recordings elicited by diverse input modalities-visual, auditory, and textual. Our approach leverages visual-language models (VLMs), using modality-specific experts to jointly interpret information across modalities. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems while remaining adaptable and extensible. This work advances toward more ecologically valid and generalizable mind decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency corrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is inserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to estimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is corrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are investigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the reconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the repetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency estimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation effectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six subjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust phase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for scanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo navigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent tSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove to be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision motion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS, provides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo times. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo navigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D fMRI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.</td>

The collection of upcoming experiments aim for sensitivity improvements up to $10^{4}$ with respect to previous searches. The MEG II experiment, searching for $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} \gamma$, is currently in its 4th year of physics data-taking with a published result from its first year of data. The Mu3e experiment is an upcoming experiment searching for $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+}$ with plans of physics data-taking as soon as 2025. The Mu2e and COMET experiments are upcoming searches for $\mu^{-} N \rightarrow e^{-} N$ with the goal of physics data-taking starting in 2027 and 2026 respectively. This proceeding summarizes the signal signature, expected background, resolutions, and timelines for the mentioned searches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The learnware paradigm offers a novel approach to machine learning by enabling users to reuse a set of well-trained models for tasks beyond the models' original purposes. It eliminates the need to build models from scratch, instead relying on specifications (representations of a model's capabilities) to identify and leverage the most suitable models for new tasks. While learnware has proven effective in many scenarios, its application to language models has remained largely unexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable universal question-answering abilities, yet they face challenges in specialized scenarios due to data scarcity, privacy concerns, and high computational costs, thus more and more specialized small language models (SLMs) are being trained for specific domains. To address these limitations systematically, the learnware paradigm provides a promising solution by enabling maximum utilization of specialized SLMs, and allowing users to identify and reuse them in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner.   This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply the learnware paradigm to language models. We simulated a learnware system comprising approximately 100 learnwares of specialized SLMs with 8B parameters, fine-tuned across finance, healthcare, and mathematics domains. Each learnware contains an SLM and a specification, which enables users to identify the most relevant models without exposing their own data. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance: by selecting one suitable learnware for each task-specific inference, the system outperforms the base SLMs on all benchmarks. Compared to LLMs, the system outperforms Qwen1.5-110B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct by at least 14% in finance domain tasks, and surpasses Flan-PaLM-540B (ranked 7th on the Open Medical LLM Leaderboard) in medical domain tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper uncovers a critical yet overlooked phenomenon in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs): detrimental concept drift within chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning during non-stationary reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where reasoning token distributions evolve unpredictably, thereby introducing significant biases in final predictions. To address this, we are pioneers in establishing the theoretical bridge between concept drift theory and RFT processes by formalizing CoT's autoregressive token streams as non-stationary distributions undergoing arbitrary temporal shifts. Leveraging this framework, we propose a novel counterfact-aware RFT that systematically decouples beneficial distribution adaptation from harmful concept drift through concept graph-empowered LLM experts generating counterfactual reasoning trajectories. Our solution, Counterfactual Preference Optimization (CPO), enables stable RFT in non-stationary environments, particularly within the medical domain, through custom-tuning of counterfactual-aware preference alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance of robustness, generalization and coordination within RFT. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset CXR-CounterFact (CCF), comprising 320,416 meticulously curated counterfactual reasoning trajectories derived from MIMIC-CXR.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designs have attracted growing research interests. However, they usually apply single receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept, Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields (ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper will be released soon.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To develop a fat-water separation approach that corrects bipolar readout gradient induced effects, without additional scans, that is compatible with any fat-water separation method. Theory and Methods: The proposed approach combines joint fat-water separation of the odd and even echoes of a bipolar multi-echo gradient echo acquisition with an inverse problem to find least-squares estimates for phase and amplitude corrections to eliminate bipolar-induced effects. Optimization of sequence parameter selection through the calculation of the number of signal averages (NSA) with Cram\'er-Rao Bound theory (CRB) is presented. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a graph cut optimization and further characterization of the accuracy was performed via Monte Carlo Simulations (MC). The proposed approach was tested in phantoms and in vivo. Proton density fat fraction maps (PDFF) were evaluated to quantify performance. Results: NSA calculations suggest short TE1 and {\Delta}TE=1.5 ms as optimal alternatives for fat-water separation. MC simulations demonstrated accurate estimation of fat and water complex signals, {\psi}, and R_2^* with mean relative error within 1%. In phantoms and in vivo, the proposed approach effectively eliminated effects induced by bipolar readout gradients, improving the outcome of the fat-water separation. Conclusion: We proposed an approach to correct bipolar readout-induced effects that are detrimental for fat-water separation. This approach can extend the use of existing fat-water separation techniques designed for data acquired using unipolar readout gradients to data collected with bipolar readout gradients.</td>

The relevance of the work is due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study, the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result, are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from 94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ pathologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models (LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario, dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Robotic endoscopic systems provide intuitive control and eliminate radiation exposure, making them a promising alternative to conventional methods. However, the lack of axial force measurement from the robot remains a major challenge, as it can lead to excessive colonic elongation, perforation, or ureteral complications. Although various methods have been proposed in previous studies, limitations such as model dependency, bulkiness, and environmental sensitivity remain challenges that should be addressed before clinical application. In this study, we propose EndoForce, a device designed for intuitive and accurate axial force measurement in endoscopic robotic systems. Inspired by the insertion motion performed by medical doctors during ureteroscopy and gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, EndoForce ensures precise force measuring while maintaining compatibility with clinical environments. The device features a streamlined design, allowing for the easy attachment and detachment of a sterile cover, and incorporates a commercial load cell to enhance cost-effectiveness and facilitate practical implementation in real medical applications. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed EndoForce, physical experiments were performed using a testbed that simulates the ureter. We show that the axial force generated during insertion was measured with high accuracy, regardless of whether the pathway was straight or curved, in a testbed simulating the human ureter.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Concerns regarding privacy and data security in conventional healthcare prompted alternative technologies. In smart healthcare, blockchain technology addresses existing concerns with security, privacy, and electronic healthcare transmission. Integration of Blockchain Technology with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows real-time monitoring of protected healthcare data. Utilizing edge devices with IoMT devices is very advantageous for addressing security, computing, and storage challenges. Encryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys is used to conceal sensitive information from unauthorized parties. SHA256 is an algorithm for one-way hashing. It is used to verify that the data has not been altered, since if it had, the hash value would have changed. This article offers a blockchain-based smart healthcare system using IoMT devices for continuous patient monitoring. In addition, it employs edge resources in addition to IoMT devices to have extra computing power and storage to hash and encrypt incoming data before sending it to the blockchain. Symmetric key is utilized to keep the data private even in the blockchain, allowing the patient to safely communicate the data through smart contracts while preventing unauthorized physicians from seeing the data. Through the use of a verification node and blockchain, an asymmetric key is used for the signing and validation of patient data in the healthcare provider system. In addition to other security measures, location-based authentication is recommended to guarantee that data originates from the patient area. Through the edge device, SHA256 is utilized to secure the data's integrity and a secret key is used to maintain its secrecy. The hChain architecture improves the computing power of IoMT environments, the security of EHR sharing through smart contracts, and the privacy and authentication procedures.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce SMURF, a scalable and unsupervised machine learning method for simultaneously segmenting vascular geometries and reconstructing velocity fields from 4D flow MRI data. SMURF models geometry and velocity fields using multilayer perceptron-based functions incorporating Fourier feature embeddings and random weight factorization to accelerate convergence. A measurement model connects these fields to the observed image magnitude and phase data. Maximum likelihood estimation and subsampling enable SMURF to process high-dimensional datasets efficiently. Evaluations on synthetic, in vitro, and in vivo datasets demonstrate SMURF's performance. On synthetic internal carotid artery aneurysm data derived from CFD, SMURF achieves a quarter-voxel segmentation accuracy across noise levels of up to 50%, outperforming the state-of-the-art segmentation method by up to double the accuracy. In an in vitro experiment on Poiseuille flow, SMURF reduces velocity reconstruction RMSE by approximately 34% compared to raw measurements. In in vivo internal carotid artery aneurysm data, SMURF attains nearly half-voxel segmentation accuracy relative to expert annotations and decreases median velocity divergence residuals by about 31%, with a 27% reduction in the interquartile range. These results indicate that SMURF is robust to noise, preserves flow structure, and identifies patient-specific morphological features. SMURF advances 4D flow MRI accuracy, potentially enhancing the diagnostic utility of 4D flow MRI in clinical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a top reason of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a novel approach by integrating patient-specific Multi-slice CT scans into CAD models and employing a one-dimensional numerical framework to assess varying degrees of stenosis. The computational analysis encompasses the entire arterial tree, with a particular focus on stenosed coronary arteries modelled using an analytical equation. One-dimensional characteristic equations, utilizing forward and backward characteristic variables, are used to derive essential parameters such as area and velocity. A model based on resistance with reflection coefficient set to zero and realistic pressure waveform input is applied at the outflow and inflow respectively. Boundary conditions generated from the 1D model, capturing global characteristics, are subsequently used to simulate a 2D axisymmetric model, which captures local characteristics. The numerical solvers are validated against literature results, ensuring grid independence. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) are calculated using various non-Newtonian models across different severities for higher order model. Additionally, the role of lesion length in stenosed coronary arteries is investigated. Numerical simulations are performed over one cardiac cycle, covering both systole and diastole phases. The results demonstrate that FFR and iFR decrease with increasing stenosis severity. This method provides a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating the functional severity of coronary artery stenosis in clinical settings, effectively capturing both global and local hemodynamic characteristics.</td>
