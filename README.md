<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spontaneous neural activity observed in resting-state fMRI is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Different measures related to local and global brain connectivity and fluctuations in low-frequency amplitudes can quantify individual aspects of these neural dynamics. Even though such measures are derived from the same functional signals, they are often evaluated separately, neglecting their interrelations and potentially reducing the analysis sensitivity. In our study, we present a fusion searchlight (FuSL) framework to combine the complementary information contained in different resting-state fMRI metrics and demonstrate how this can improve the decoding of brain states. Moreover, we show how explainable AI allows us to reconstruct the differential impact of each metric on the decoding, which additionally increases spatial specificity of searchlight analysis. In general, this framework can be adapted to combine information derived from different imaging modalities or experimental conditions, offering a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visual illusions in humans arise when interpreting out-of-distribution stimuli: if the observer is adapted to certain statistics, perception of outliers deviates from reality. Recent studies have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also be deceived by visual illusions. This revelation raises profound questions about the nature of visual information. Why are two independent systems, both human brains and ANNs, susceptible to the same illusions? Should any ANN be capable of perceiving visual illusions? Are these perceptions a feature or a flaw? In this work, we study how visual illusions are encoded in diffusion models. Remarkably, we show that they present human-like brightness/color shifts in their latent space. We use this fact to demonstrate that diffusion models can predict visual illusions. Furthermore, we also show how to generate new unseen visual illusions in realistic images using text-to-image diffusion models. We validate this ability through psychophysical experiments that show how our model-generated illusions also fool humans.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As software pervades more and more areas of our professional and personal lives, there is an ever-increasing need to maintain software, and for programmers to be able to efficiently write and understand program code. In the first study of its kind, we analyze fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to explore the online processing of program code patterns that are ambiguous to programmers, but not the computer (so-called atoms of confusion), and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms in an ecologically valid setting. Relative to unambiguous counterparts in program code, atoms of confusion elicit a late frontal positivity with a duration of about 400 to 700 ms after first looking at the atom of confusion. As the frontal positivity shows high resemblance with an event-related potential (ERP) component found during natural language processing that is elicited by unexpected but plausible words in sentence context, we take these data to suggest that the brain engages similar neurocognitive mechanisms in response to unexpected and informative inputs in program code and in natural language. In both domains, these inputs lead to an update of a comprehender's situation model that is essential for information extraction from a quickly unfolding input.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transfer learning (TL) has been widely used in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for reducing calibration efforts. However, backdoor attacks could be introduced through TL. In such attacks, an attacker embeds a backdoor with a specific pattern into the machine learning model. As a result, the model will misclassify a test sample with the backdoor trigger into a prespecified class while still maintaining good performance on benign samples. Accordingly, this study explores backdoor attacks in the TL of EEG-based BCIs, where source-domain data are poisoned by a backdoor trigger and then used in TL. We propose several active poisoning approaches to select source-domain samples, which are most effective in embedding the backdoor pattern, to improve the attack success rate and efficiency. Experiments on four EEG datasets and three deep learning models demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first study about backdoor attacks on TL models in EEG-based BCIs. It exposes a serious security risk in BCIs, which should be immediately addressed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Graph neural networks (GNNs) with unsupervised learning can solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with efficient time complexity, making them versatile for various applications. However, since this method maps the combinatorial optimization problem to the training process of a graph neural network, and the current mainstream backpropagation-based training algorithms are prone to fall into local minima, the optimization performance is still inferior to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) COP methods. To address this issue, inspired by possibly chaotic dynamics of real brain learning, we introduce a chaotic training algorithm, i.e. chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP), which introduces a local loss function in GNN that makes the training process not only chaotic but also highly efficient. Different from existing methods, we show that the global ergodicity and pseudo-randomness of such chaotic dynamics enable CGBP to learn each optimal GNN effectively and globally, thus solving the COP efficiently. We have applied CGBP to solve various COPs, such as the maximum independent set, maximum cut, and graph coloring. Results on several large-scale benchmark datasets showcase that CGBP can outperform not only existing GNN algorithms but also SOTA methods. In addition to solving large-scale COPs, CGBP as a universal learning algorithm for GNNs, i.e. as a plug-in unit, can be easily integrated into any existing method for improving the performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most popular input signal in BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. Most research on EEG-based BCIs focuses on the accurate decoding of EEG signals; however, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, and so on, which should be protected. This paper first exposes a serious privacy problem in EEG-based BCIs, i.e., the user identity in EEG data can be easily learned so that different sessions of EEG data from the same user can be associated together to more reliably mine private information. To address this issue, we further propose two approaches to convert the original EEG data into identity-unlearnable EEG data, i.e., removing the user identity information while maintaining the good performance on the primary BCI task. Experiments on seven EEG datasets from five different BCI paradigms showed that on average the generated identity-unlearnable EEG data can reduce the user identification accuracy from 70.01\% to at most 21.36\%, greatly facilitating user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding emotional processing in the human brain requires examining the complex interactions between different brain regions. While previous studies have identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic network approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory to investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks during resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to fear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions would be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to fear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to emotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed participants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in positive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the resting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly decreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward instability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing. Additionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during fear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized network and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's remarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how network stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced triads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex mechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in response to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding emotional resilience and neurological disorders.</td>

We focus on spatially embedded network models and datasets where links are physical objects or physically transfer some quantity, which can be disrupted at any point along its trajectory. To simulate physical damage, we tile the networks with boxes of equal size and sequentially damage them. By introducing an intersection graph to keep track of the links passing through tiles, we systematically analyze the connectivity of the network and explore how the physical layout and the topology of the network jointly affect its percolation threshold. We show that random layouts make networks extremely vulnerable to physical damage, driven by the presence of very elongated links, and that higher-dimensional embeddings further increase their vulnerability. We compare this picture against targeted physical damages, showing that it accelerates network dismantling and yields non-trivial geometric patterns. Finally, we apply our framework to several empirical networks, from airline networks to vascular systems and the brain, showing qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Understanding multiple sclerosis progression and identifying the implicated brain structures is crucial for personalized treatment decisions. Deformation-based morphometry utilizes anatomical magnetic resonance imaging to quantitatively assess volumetric brain changes at the voxel level, providing insight into how each brain region contributes to clinical progression with regards to neurodegeneration. Utilizing such voxel-level data from a relapsing multiple sclerosis clinical trial, we extend a model-agnostic feature importance metric to identify a robust and predictive feature set that corresponds to clinical progression. These features correspond to brain regions that are clinically meaningful in MS disease research, demonstrating their scientific relevance. When used to predict progression using classical survival models and 3D convolutional neural networks, the identified regions led to the best-performing models, demonstrating their prognostic strength. We also find that these features generalize well to other definitions of clinical progression and can compensate for the omission of highly prognostic clinical features, underscoring the predictive power and clinical relevance of deformation-based morphometry as a regional identification tool.</td>

A unification method combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the interpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded 87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score.

We propose an algorithm for real-time identification of alterations in the transition matrices of high-dimensional vector autoregressive models. The algorithm estimates transition matrices and error term variances using regularization techniques applied to training data, then computes a specific test statistic to detect changes in transition matrices as new data batches arrive. We establish the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under the scenario of no change points, subject to mild conditions. An alarm is raised when the calculated test statistic exceeds a predefined quantile of the standard normal distribution. We demonstrate that, as the size of the change (jump size) increases, the test power approaches one. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated empirically across various simulation scenarios. Finally, we present two applications of the proposed methodology: analyzing shocks in S&P 500 data and detecting the timing of seizures in EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Time-series foundation models have the ability to run inference, mainly forecasting, on any type of time series data, thanks to the informative representations comprising waveform features. Wearable sensing data, on the other hand, contain more variability in both patterns and frequency bands of interest and generally emphasize more on the ability to infer healthcare-related outcomes. The main challenge of crafting a foundation model for wearable sensing physiological signals is to learn generalizable representations that support efficient adaptation across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. In this work, we propose NormWear, a step toward such a foundation model, aiming to extract generalized and informative wearable sensing representations. NormWear has been pretrained on a large set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public resources. For a holistic assessment, we perform downstream evaluation on 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in the areas of mental health, body state inference, biomarker estimations, and disease risk evaluations. We demonstrate that NormWear achieves a better performance improvement over competitive baselines in general time series foundation modeling. In addition, leveraging a novel representation-alignment-match-based method, we align physiological signals embeddings with text embeddings. This alignment enables our proposed foundation model to perform zero-shot inference, allowing it to generalize to previously unseen wearable signal-based health applications. Finally, we perform nonlinear dynamic analysis on the waveform features extracted by the model at each intermediate layer. This analysis quantifies the model's internal processes, offering clear insights into its behavior and fostering greater trust in its inferences among end users.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the direct control of external devices through the imagined movements of various body parts. Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI decoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit triggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to first distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the MI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes a sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based asynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to screen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI classification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by self-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject and cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG datasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the highest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to provide transformative control in prosthetics, assistive technologies (wheelchairs), robotics, and human-computer interfaces. While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive approach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the requirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex algorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world settings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a sliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for real-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional and attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams, reducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data collection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source electroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot over three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical evidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with reduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the practicality and accessibility of BCI technology. This advancement makes BCI applications more feasible for real-world scenarios, particularly in controlling robotic systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A common concern in the field of functional data analysis is the challenge of temporal misalignment, which is typically addressed using curve registration methods. Currently, most of these methods assume the data is governed by a single common shape or a finite mixture of population level shapes. We introduce more flexibility using mixed membership models. Individual observations are assumed to partially belong to different clusters, allowing variation across multiple functional features. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the underlying shapes, as well as the individual time-transformation functions and levels of membership. Motivating this work is data from EEG signals in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our method agrees with the neuroimaging literature, recovering the 1/f pink noise feature distinctly from the peak in the alpha band. Furthermore, the introduction of a regression component in the estimation of time-transformation functions quantifies the effect of age and clinical designation on the location of the peak alpha frequency (PAF).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The classification of harmful brain activities, such as seizures and periodic discharges, play a vital role in neurocritical care, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method for monitoring brain activity, but the manual interpretation of EEG signals are time-consuming and rely heavily on expert judgment. This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and EEGNet, applied to the classification of harmful brain activities using both raw EEG data and time-frequency representations generated through Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). We evaluate the performance of these models use multimodal data representations, including high-resolution spectrograms and waveform data, and introduce a multi-stage training strategy to improve model robustness. Our results show that training strategies, data preprocessing, and augmentation techniques are as critical to model success as architecture choice, with multi-stage TinyViT and EfficientNet demonstrating superior performance. The findings underscore the importance of robust training regimes in achieving accurate and efficient EEG classification, providing valuable insights for deploying AI models in clinical practice.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transfer learning (TL) has been widely used in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for reducing calibration efforts. However, backdoor attacks could be introduced through TL. In such attacks, an attacker embeds a backdoor with a specific pattern into the machine learning model. As a result, the model will misclassify a test sample with the backdoor trigger into a prespecified class while still maintaining good performance on benign samples. Accordingly, this study explores backdoor attacks in the TL of EEG-based BCIs, where source-domain data are poisoned by a backdoor trigger and then used in TL. We propose several active poisoning approaches to select source-domain samples, which are most effective in embedding the backdoor pattern, to improve the attack success rate and efficiency. Experiments on four EEG datasets and three deep learning models demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first study about backdoor attacks on TL models in EEG-based BCIs. It exposes a serious security risk in BCIs, which should be immediately addressed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most popular input signal in BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. Most research on EEG-based BCIs focuses on the accurate decoding of EEG signals; however, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, and so on, which should be protected. This paper first exposes a serious privacy problem in EEG-based BCIs, i.e., the user identity in EEG data can be easily learned so that different sessions of EEG data from the same user can be associated together to more reliably mine private information. To address this issue, we further propose two approaches to convert the original EEG data into identity-unlearnable EEG data, i.e., removing the user identity information while maintaining the good performance on the primary BCI task. Experiments on seven EEG datasets from five different BCI paradigms showed that on average the generated identity-unlearnable EEG data can reduce the user identification accuracy from 70.01\% to at most 21.36\%, greatly facilitating user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery (MI) is a classical paradigm in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Online accurate and fast decoding is very important to its successful applications. This paper proposes a simple yet effective front-end replication dynamic window (FRDW) algorithm for this purpose. Dynamic windows enable the classification based on a test EEG trial shorter than those used in training, improving the decision speed; front-end replication fills a short test EEG trial to the length used in training, improving the classification accuracy. Within-subject and cross-subject online MI classification experiments on three public datasets, with three different classifiers and three different data augmentation approaches, demonstrated that FRDW can significantly increase the information transfer rate in MI decoding. Additionally, FR can also be used in training data augmentation. FRDW helped win national champion of the China BCI Competition in 2022.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the direct control of external devices through the imagined movements of various body parts. Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI decoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit triggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to first distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the MI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes a sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based asynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to screen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI classification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by self-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject and cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG datasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the highest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to provide transformative control in prosthetics, assistive technologies (wheelchairs), robotics, and human-computer interfaces. While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive approach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the requirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex algorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world settings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a sliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for real-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional and attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams, reducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data collection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source electroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot over three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical evidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with reduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the practicality and accessibility of BCI technology. This advancement makes BCI applications more feasible for real-world scenarios, particularly in controlling robotic systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This perspective article aims at providing an outline of the state of the art and future developments towards the integration of cutting-edge predictive language models with BCI. A synthetic overview of early and more recent linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM, that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed. Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models, the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and user-adaptive neurotechnology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the human brain and a computer. Due to individual differences and non-stationarity of EEG signals, such BCIs usually require a subject-specific calibration session before each use, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly. Transfer learning (TL) has been proposed to shorten or eliminate this calibration, but existing TL approaches mainly consider offline settings, where all unlabeled EEG trials from the new user are available. Methods: This paper proposes Test-Time Information Maximization Ensemble (T-TIME) to accommodate the most challenging online TL scenario, where unlabeled EEG data from the new user arrive in a stream, and immediate classification is performed. T-TIME initializes multiple classifiers from the aligned source data. When an unlabeled test EEG trial arrives, T-TIME first predicts its labels using ensemble learning, and then updates each classifier by conditional entropy minimization and adaptive marginal distribution regularization. Our code is publicized. Results: Extensive experiments on three public motor imagery based BCI datasets demonstrated that T-TIME outperformed about 20 classical and state-of-the-art TL approaches. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first work on test time adaptation for calibration-free EEG-based BCIs, making plug-and-play BCIs possible.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A multitude of individuals across the globe grapple with motor disabilities. Neural prosthetics utilizing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology exhibit promise for improving motor rehabilitation outcomes. The intricate nature of EEG data poses a significant hurdle for current BCI systems. Recently, a qualitative repository of EEG signals tied to both upper and lower limb execution of motor and motor imagery tasks has been unveiled. Despite this, the productivity of the Machine Learning (ML) Models that were trained on this dataset was alarmingly deficient, and the evaluation framework seemed insufficient. To enhance outcomes, robust feature engineering (signal processing) methodologies are implemented. A collection of time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet-derived features was obtained from 16-channel EEG signals, and the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) approach was employed to identify the four most significant features. For classification K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB) models were implemented with these selected features, evaluating their effectiveness through metrics such as testing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. By leveraging SVM with a Gaussian Kernel, a remarkable maximum testing accuracy of 92.50% for motor activities and 95.48% for imagery activities is achieved. These results are notably more dependable and gratifying compared to the previous study, where the peak accuracy was recorded at 74.36%. This research work provides an in-depth analysis of the MI Limb EEG dataset and it will help in designing and developing simple, cost-effective and reliable BCI systems for neuro-rehabilitation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spontaneous neural activity observed in resting-state fMRI is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Different measures related to local and global brain connectivity and fluctuations in low-frequency amplitudes can quantify individual aspects of these neural dynamics. Even though such measures are derived from the same functional signals, they are often evaluated separately, neglecting their interrelations and potentially reducing the analysis sensitivity. In our study, we present a fusion searchlight (FuSL) framework to combine the complementary information contained in different resting-state fMRI metrics and demonstrate how this can improve the decoding of brain states. Moreover, we show how explainable AI allows us to reconstruct the differential impact of each metric on the decoding, which additionally increases spatial specificity of searchlight analysis. In general, this framework can be adapted to combine information derived from different imaging modalities or experimental conditions, offering a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding emotional processing in the human brain requires examining the complex interactions between different brain regions. While previous studies have identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic network approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory to investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks during resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to fear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions would be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to fear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to emotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed participants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in positive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the resting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly decreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward instability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing. Additionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during fear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized network and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's remarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how network stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced triads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex mechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in response to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding emotional resilience and neurological disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain aging involves structural and functional changes and therefore serves as a key biomarker for brain health. Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to improve brain age estimation by leveraging complementary data. However, fMRI data, being noisier than sMRI, complicates multimodal fusion. Traditional fusion methods often introduce more noise than useful information, which can reduce accuracy compared to using sMRI alone. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework for biological brain age estimation, utilizing a sex-aware adversarial variational autoencoder (SA-AVAE). Our framework integrates adversarial and variational learning to effectively disentangle the latent features from both modalities. Specifically, we decompose the latent space into modality-specific codes and shared codes to represent complementary and common information across modalities, respectively. To enhance the disentanglement, we introduce cross-reconstruction and shared-distinct distance ratio loss as regularization terms. Importantly, we incorporate sex information into the learned latent code, enabling the model to capture sex-specific aging patterns for brain age estimation via an integrated regressor module. We evaluate our model using the publicly available OpenBHB dataset, a comprehensive multi-site dataset for brain age estimation. The results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches and shows significant robustness across various age groups, highlighting its potential for real-time clinical applications in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semantic representations are integral to natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence. Although often derived from internet text, recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of behavior-based (e.g., free associations) and brain-based (e.g., fMRI) representations, which promise improvements in our ability to measure and model human representations. We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the similarities and differences between semantic representations derived from text, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information that differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our psychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call representational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior representations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and socio-moral dimensions. We thus establish behavior as an important complement to text for capturing human representations and behavior. These results are broadly relevant to research aimed at learning human-aligned semantic representations, including work on evaluating and aligning large language models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Outlying observations are frequently encountered in a wide spectrum of scientific domains, posing significant challenges for the generalizability of statistical models and the reproducibility of downstream analysis. These observations can be identified through influential diagnosis, which refers to the detection of observations that are unduly influential on diverse facets of statistical inference. To date, methods for identifying observations influencing the choice of a stochastically selected submodel have been underdeveloped, especially in the high-dimensional setting where the number of predictors p exceeds the sample size n. Recently we proposed an improved diagnostic measure to handle this setting. However, its distributional properties and approximations have not yet been explored. To address this shortcoming, the notion of exchangeability is revived, and used to determine the exact finite- and large-sample distributions of our assessment metric. This forms the foundation for the introduction of both parametric and non-parametric approaches for its approximation and the establishment of thresholds for diagnosis. The resulting framework is extended to logistic regression models, followed by a simulation study conducted to assess the performance of various detection procedures. Finally the framework is applied to data from an fMRI study of thermal pain, with the goal of identifying outlying subjects that could distort the formulation of statistical models using functional brain activity in predicting physical pain ratings. Both linear and logistic regression models are used to demonstrate the benefits of detection and compare the performances of different detection procedures. In particular, two additional influential observations are identified, which are not discovered by previous studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder of the central nervous system, which occurs most frequently in childhood and is characterized by unusual and repetitive ritualistic behaviors. Currently, diagnostic methods primarily rely on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observation, which may lead to misdiagnoses due to the subjective evaluation and measurement used in these traditional methods. With the advancement in medical imaging, MR imaging-based diagnosis has become an alternative and more objective approach. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid neural Network model for ASD identification, termded ASD-HNet, to hierarchically extract features on the functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. This hierarchical method can better extract brain representations, improve the diagnostic accuracy, and help us better locate brain regions related to ASD. Specifically, features are extracted from three scales: local regions of interest (ROIs) scale, community-clustering scale, and the whole-communities scale. For the ROI scale, graph convolution is used to transfer features between ROIs. At the community cluster scale, functional gradients are introduced, the clustering algorithm K-Means is used to automatically cluster ROIs with similar functional gradients into several communities, and features of ROIs belonging to the same community are extracted to characterize these communities. At global information integration scale, we extract global features from community-scale brain networks to characterize the whole brain networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method using the public dataset of Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), and elucidate the interpretability of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASD-HNet can yield superior performance than compared methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study investigated the dynamic connectivity patterns between EEG and fMRI modalities, contributing to our understanding of brain network interactions. By employing a comprehensive approach that integrated static and dynamic analyses of EEG-fMRI data, we were able to uncover distinct connectivity states and characterize their temporal fluctuations. The results revealed modular organization within the intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) of the brain, highlighting the significant roles of sensory systems and the default mode network. The use of a sliding window technique allowed us to assess how functional connectivity varies over time, further elucidating the transient nature of brain connectivity. Additionally, our findings align with previous literature, reinforcing the notion that cognitive states can be effectively identified through short-duration data, specifically within the 30-60 second timeframe. The established relationships between connectivity strength and cognitive processes, particularly during different visual states, underscore the relevance of our approach for future research into brain dynamics. Overall, this study not only enhances our understanding of the interplay between EEG and fMRI signals but also paves the way for further exploration into the neural correlates of cognitive functions and their implications in clinical settings. Future research should focus on refining these methodologies and exploring their applications in various cognitive and clinical contexts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is extensively used in clinical and preclinical settings to study brain function, however, fMRI data is inherently noisy due to physiological processes, hardware, and external noise. Denoising is one of the main preprocessing steps in any fMRI analysis pipeline. This process is challenging in preclinical data in comparison to clinical data due to variations in brain geometry, image resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserved algorithm based on a 3D Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a 3D dense U-net based discriminator called, 3D U-WGAN. We apply a 4D data configuration to effectively denoise temporal and spatial information in analyzing preclinical fMRI data. GAN-based denoising methods often utilize a discriminator to identify significant differences between denoised and noise-free images, focusing on global or local features. To refine the fMRI denoising model, our method employs a 3D dense U-Net discriminator to learn both global and local distinctions. To tackle potential over-smoothing, we introduce an adversarial loss and enhance perceptual similarity by measuring feature space distances. Experiments illustrate that 3D U-WGAN significantly improves image quality in resting-state and task preclinical fMRI data, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio without introducing excessive structural changes in existing methods. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to simulated and real data in a fMRI analysis pipeline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) aims to extract visual information perceived by humans from brain activity recorded through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Despite notable advancements in recent years, existing studies in VBU continue to face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose knowledge from prior subjects as they adapt to new ones. Addressing continual learning in this field is, therefore, essential. This paper introduces a novel framework called Continual Learning for Vision-Brain (COBRA) to address continual learning in VBU. Our approach includes three novel modules: a Subject Commonality (SC) module, a Prompt-based Subject Specific (PSS) module, and a transformer-based module for fMRI, denoted as MRIFormer module. The SC module captures shared vision-brain patterns across subjects, preserving this knowledge as the model encounters new subjects, thereby reducing the impact of catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, the PSS module learns unique vision-brain patterns specific to each subject. Finally, the MRIFormer module contains a transformer encoder and decoder that learns the fMRI features for VBU from common and specific patterns. In a continual learning setup, COBRA is trained in new PSS and MRIFormer modules for new subjects, leaving the modules of previous subjects unaffected. As a result, COBRA effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both continual learning and vision-brain reconstruction tasks, surpassing previous methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\% to 54.88\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios.</td>

Measuring goal-directedness is important, as it is a critical element of many concerns about harm from AI. It is also of philosophical interest, as goal-directedness is a key aspect of agency. MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The observation of a resonance structure in the opening angle of the electron-positron pairs in the $^{7}$Li(p,\ee) $^{8}$Be reaction was claimed and interpreted as the production and subsequent decay of a hypothetical particle (X17). Similar excesses, consistent with this particle, were later observed in processes involving $^{4}$He and $^{12}$C nuclei with the same experimental technique. The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target. The $\gamma$ and the e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair emerging from the $^8\mathrm{Be}^*$ transitions were studied with calorimeters and a spectrometer, featuring a broader angular acceptance than previous experiments. We present in this paper the analysis of a four-week data-taking in 2023 with a beam energy of 1080 keV, resulting in the excitation of two different resonances with Q-value \SI{17.6}{\mega\electronvolt} and \SI{18.1}{\mega\electronvolt}. No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</td>

Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained via contrastive learning have achieved notable success in natural image tasks. However, their application in the medical domain remains limited due to the scarcity of openly accessible, large-scale medical image-text datasets. Existing medical VLMs either train on closed-source proprietary or relatively small open-source datasets that do not generalize well. Similarly, most models remain specific to a single or limited number of medical imaging domains, again restricting their applicability to other modalities. To address this gap, we introduce UniMed, a large-scale, open-source multi-modal medical dataset comprising over 5.3 million image-text pairs across six diverse imaging modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Pathology, and Fundus. UniMed is developed using a data-collection framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform modality-specific classification datasets into image-text formats while incorporating existing image-text data from the medical domain, facilitating scalable VLM pretraining. Using UniMed, we trained UniMed-CLIP, a unified VLM for six modalities that significantly outperforms existing generalist VLMs and matches modality-specific medical VLMs, achieving notable gains in zero-shot evaluations. For instance, UniMed-CLIP improves over BiomedCLIP (trained on proprietary data) by an absolute gain of +12.61, averaged over 21 datasets, while using 3x less training data. To facilitate future research, we release UniMed dataset, training codes, and models at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A myriad of measures to illustrate performance of predictive artificial intelligence (AI) models have been proposed in the literature. Selecting appropriate performance measures is essential for predictive AI models that are developed to be used in medical practice, because poorly performing models may harm patients and lead to increased costs. We aim to assess the merits of classic and contemporary performance measures when validating predictive AI models for use in medical practice. We focus on models with a binary outcome. We discuss 32 performance measures covering five performance domains (discrimination, calibration, overall, classification, and clinical utility) along with accompanying graphical assessments. The first four domains cover statistical performance, the fifth domain covers decision-analytic performance. We explain why two key characteristics are important when selecting which performance measures to assess: (1) whether the measure's expected value is optimized when it is calculated using the correct probabilities (i.e., a "proper" measure), and (2) whether they reflect either purely statistical performance or decision-analytic performance by properly considering misclassification costs. Seventeen measures exhibit both characteristics, fourteen measures exhibited one characteristic, and one measure possessed neither characteristic (the F1 measure). All classification measures (such as classification accuracy and F1) are improper for clinically relevant decision thresholds other than 0.5 or the prevalence. We recommend the following measures and plots as essential to report: AUROC, calibration plot, a clinical utility measure such as net benefit with decision curve analysis, and a plot with probability distributions per outcome category.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is an emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize radiology and medical diagnostics. In comparison to traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRF enables the rapid, simultaneous, non-invasive acquisition and reconstruction of multiple tissue parameters, paving the way for novel diagnostic techniques. In the original matching approach, reconstruction is based on the search for the best matches between in vivo acquired signals and a dictionary of high-dimensional simulated signals (fingerprints) with known tissue properties. A critical and limiting challenge is that the size of the simulated dictionary increases exponentially with the number of parameters, leading to an extremely costly subsequent matching. In this work, we propose to address this scalability issue by considering probabilistic mixtures of high-dimensional elliptical distributions, to learn more efficient dictionary representations. Mixture components are modelled as flexible ellipitic shapes in low dimensional subspaces. They are exploited to cluster similar signals and reduce their dimension locally cluster-wise to limit information loss. To estimate such a mixture model, we provide a new incremental algorithm capable of handling large numbers of signals, allowing us to go far beyond the hardware limitations encountered by standard implementations. We demonstrate, on simulated and real data, that our method effectively manages large volumes of MRF data with maintained accuracy. It offers a more efficient solution for accurate tissue characterization and significantly reduces the computational burden, making the clinical application of MRF more practical and accessible.</td>

Parallelly, research in different mathematical areas concerning discrete inverse problems has led to the development of new sophisticated numerical solvers that can be applied in the context of CT.

However, since its inception, the tools' features and codebase have had over a twenty-fold increase, and are now including greater geometric flexibility, a variety of modern algorithms for image reconstruction, high-performance computing features and support for other CT modalities, like proton CT. The purpose of this work is two-fold: first, it provides a structured overview of the current version of the TIGRE toolbox, providing appropriate descriptions and references, and serving as a comprehensive and peer-reviewed guide for the user; second, it is an opportunity to illustrate the performance of several of the available solvers showcasing real CT acquisitions, which are typically not be openly available to algorithm developers.</td>

Current clinical detection techniques face limitations in accuracy and efficiency, necessitating improved automated diagnostic solutions. This study introduces a novel Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) module, specifically designed to enhance multi-scale feature representation while optimizing computational efficiency. By integrating CAGA with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a score of 0.98% on the MCSI dataset, while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. This reduction in computational complexity maintains diagnostic accuracy while enabling broader deployment across resource-constrained healthcare settings. Extensive validation across two other benchmark datasets, including MSID and MSLD, demonstrate the model's robustness, consistently outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that CAGA's efficient feature extraction mechanism could be adapted for other medical imaging tasks requiring fine-grained visual discrimination.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Uplift modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) estimation aim at predicting the causal effect of an action, such as a medical treatment or a marketing campaign on a specific individual. In this paper, we focus on data from Randomized Controlled Experiments which guarantee causal interpretation of the outcomes. Class and treatment imbalance are important problems in uplift modeling/HTE, but classical undersampling or oversampling based approaches are hard to apply in this case since they distort the predicted effect. Calibration methods have been proposed in the past, however, they do not guarantee correct predictions. In this work, we propose an approach alternative to undersampling, based on flipping the class value of selected records. We show that the proposed approach does not distort the predicted effect and does not require calibration. The method is especially useful for models based on class variable transformation (modified outcome models). We address those models separately, designing a transformation scheme which guarantees correct predictions and addresses also the problem of treatment imbalance which is especially important for those models. Experiments fully confirm our theoretical results. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is a viable alternative also for standard classification problems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant promise for improving breast cancer diagnosis in medical imaging. However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks--small, imperceptible changes that can mislead classifiers--raising critical concerns about their reliability and security. Traditional attacks rely on fixed-norm perturbations, misaligning with human perception. In contrast, diffusion-based attacks require pre-trained models, demanding substantial data when these models are unavailable, limiting practical use in data-scarce scenarios. In medical imaging, however, this is often unfeasible due to the limited availability of datasets. Building on recent advancements in learnable prompts, we propose Prompt2Perturb (P2P), a novel language-guided attack method capable of generating meaningful attack examples driven by text instructions. During the prompt learning phase, our approach leverages learnable prompts within the text encoder to create subtle, yet impactful, perturbations that remain imperceptible while guiding the model towards targeted outcomes. In contrast to current prompt learning-based approaches, our P2P stands out by directly updating text embeddings, avoiding the need for retraining diffusion models. Further, we leverage the finding that optimizing only the early reverse diffusion steps boosts efficiency while ensuring that the generated adversarial examples incorporate subtle noise, thus preserving ultrasound image quality without introducing noticeable artifacts. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attack techniques across three breast ultrasound datasets in FID and LPIPS. Moreover, the generated images are both more natural in appearance and more effective compared to existing adversarial attacks. Our code will be publicly available https://github.com/yasamin-med/P2P.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Crystallization of proteins, specifically proteins of medical relevance, is performed for various reasons such as to understand the protein structure and to design therapies. Obtaining kinetic constants in rate laws for nucleation and growth of advanced biotherapeutics such as capsids, an assembly of macromolecules, is challenging and essential to the design of the crystallization processes. In this work, coupled population balance and species balance equations are developed to extract nucleation and growth kinetics for crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids. A comparison of model results with that of experimental data for capsid crystallization in hanging-drop vapor diffusion system shows that slow rate of vapor diffusion from the droplet controls the initial nucleation and growth processes, and the capsid nucleation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation in the microdroplet. Results also show that the capsids, which are of very high molecular weight (~3.6 MDa), have a similar tendency to nucleate as small organic molecules such as glycine (75 Da), low-molecular-weight proteins, and small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients due to its ball-shaped outer structure/shape. Capids also show a prolonged nucleation period as for proteins and other macromolecules, but has a slow growth rate with a growth rate pre-factor seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of lysozyme. The capsid crystal growth rate is weakly sensitive to the supersaturation compared to lysozyme and is limited by the transport of capsids due to slow Brownian motion resulting from the very high molecular weight.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Digital healthcare systems have revolutionized medical services, facilitating provider collaboration, enhancing diagnosis, and optimizing and improving treatments. They deliver superior quality, faster, reliable, and cost-effective services. Researchers are addressing pressing health challenges by integrating information technology, computing resources, and digital health records. However, digitizing healthcare introduces significant risks to patient data privacy and security, with the potential for unauthorized access to protected health information. Although patients can authorize data access through consent, there is a pressing need for mechanisms to ensure such given consent is informed and executed properly and timely. Patients deserve transparency and accountability regarding the access to their data: who access it, when, and under what circumstances. Current healthcare systems, often centralized, leave much to be desired in managing these concerns, leading to numerous security incidents. To address these issues, we propose a system based on blockchain and smart contracts for managing informed consent for accessing health records by the treatment team members, incorporating safeguards to verify that consent processes are correctly executed. Blockchain's inherent immutability ensures the integrity of consent. Smart contracts automatically execute agreements, enhancing accountability. They provide a robust framework for protecting patient privacy in the digital age. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach can be integrated easily with the existing healthcare systems without incurring financial and technological challenges.</td>
