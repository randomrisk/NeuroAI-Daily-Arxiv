<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human's perception of the visual world is shaped by the stereo processing of 3D information. Understanding how the brain perceives and processes 3D visual stimuli in the real world has been a longstanding endeavor in neuroscience. Towards this goal, we introduce a new neuroscience task: decoding 3D visual perception from EEG signals, a neuroimaging technique that enables real-time monitoring of neural dynamics enriched with complex visual cues. To provide the essential benchmark, we first present EEG-3D, a pioneering dataset featuring multimodal analysis data and extensive EEG recordings from 12 subjects viewing 72 categories of 3D objects rendered in both videos and images. Furthermore, we propose Neuro-3D, a 3D visual decoding framework based on EEG signals. This framework adaptively integrates EEG features derived from static and dynamic stimuli to learn complementary and robust neural representations, which are subsequently utilized to recover both the shape and color of 3D objects through the proposed diffusion-based colored point cloud decoder. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore EEG-based 3D visual decoding. Experiments indicate that Neuro-3D not only reconstructs colored 3D objects with high fidelity, but also learns effective neural representations that enable insightful brain region analysis. The dataset and associated code will be made publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Geometric shape features have been widely used as strong predictors for image classification. Nevertheless, most existing classifiers such as deep neural networks (DNNs) directly leverage the statistical correlations between these shape features and target variables. However, these correlations can often be spurious and unstable across different environments (e.g., in different age groups, certain types of brain changes have unstable relations with neurodegenerative disease); hence leading to biased or inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that for the first time develops invariant shape representation learning (ISRL) to further strengthen the robustness of image classifiers. In contrast to existing approaches that mainly derive features in the image space, our model ISRL is designed to jointly capture invariant features in latent shape spaces parameterized by deformable transformations. To achieve this goal, we develop a new learning paradigm based on invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn invariant representations of image and shape features across multiple training distributions/environments. By embedding the features that are invariant with regard to target variables in different environments, our model consistently offers more accurate predictions. We validate our method by performing classification tasks on both simulated 2D images, real 3D brain and cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tonmoy-hossain/ISRL.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traits are patterns of brain signals and behaviors that are stable over time but differ across individuals, whereas states are phasic patterns that vary over time, are influenced by the environment, yet oscillate around the traits. The quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the interacting agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and states from the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits and states in relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we developed a pipeline to extract latent dimensions of the brain from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a team flow task. Our pipeline involved two stages of dimensionality reduction: first, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This pipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG latent space that revealed a trait-state hierarchical structure, with macro-segregation capturing neural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural states. Out of the seven latent dimensions, we found that three that significantly contributed to variations across individuals and task states. Using representational similarity analysis, we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space, establishing a connection between hidden neural signatures and social interaction behaviors. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of representing both traits and states within a single model that correlates with changes in social behavior.</td>

Applied to graphs derived from EEG recordings of human brain activity, our approach reveals macroscopic properties emerging from neuronal interactions, such as collective behavior in the form of coordinated neuronal activity.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Each voxel in a diffusion MRI (dMRI) image contains a spherical signal corresponding to the direction and strength of water diffusion in the brain. This paper advances the analysis of such spatio-spherical data by developing convolutional network layers that are equivariant to the $\mathbf{E(3) \times SO(3)}$ group and account for the physical symmetries of dMRI including rotations, translations, and reflections of space alongside voxel-wise rotations. Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography. These gains are experimentally consistent across both simulation and in vivo human datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal medical image fusion is a crucial task that combines complementary information from different imaging modalities into a unified representation, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have significantly advanced fusion performance, some of the existing CNN-based methods fall short in capturing fine-grained multiscale and edge features, leading to suboptimal feature integration. Transformer-based models, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training and fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use. Moreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture that addresses these limitations by introducing a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for effective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to enhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and efficient fusion, we present a parameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax, which requires no additional computations during training or inference. Extensive experiments, including a downstream brain tumor classification task, demonstrate that our approach outperforms various baseline methods in terms of visual quality, texture preservation, and fusion speed, making it a possible practical solution for real-world clinical applications. The code will be released at https://github.com/simonZhou86/en_dran.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reservoir computing (RC), is a class of computational methods such as Echo State Networks (ESN) and Liquid State Machines (LSM) describe a generic method to perform pattern recognition and temporal analysis with any non-linear system. This is enabled by Reservoir Computing being a shallow network model with only Input, Reservoir, and Readout layers where input and reservoir weights are not learned (only the readout layer is trained). LSM is a special case of Reservoir computing inspired by the organization of neurons in the brain and generally refers to spike-based Reservoir computing approaches. LSMs have been successfully used to showcase decent performance on some neuromorphic vision and speech datasets but a common problem associated with LSMs is that since the model is more-or-less fixed, the main way to improve the performance is by scaling up the Reservoir size, but that only gives diminishing rewards despite a tremendous increase in model size and computation. In this paper, we propose two approaches for effectively ensembling LSM models - Multi-Length Scale Reservoir Ensemble (MuLRE) and Temporal Excitation Partitioned Reservoir Ensemble (TEPRE) and benchmark them on Neuromorphic-MNIST (N-MNIST), Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and DVSGesture datasets, which are standard neuromorphic benchmarks. We achieve 98.1% test accuracy on N-MNIST with a 3600-neuron LSM model which is higher than any prior LSM-based approach and 77.8% test accuracy on the SHD dataset which is on par with a standard Recurrent Spiking Neural Network trained by Backprop Through Time (BPTT). We also propose receptive field-based input weights to the Reservoir to work alongside the Multi-Length Scale Reservoir ensemble model for vision tasks. Thus, we introduce effective means of scaling up the performance of LSM models and evaluate them against relevant neuromorphic benchmarks</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite extensive research, the precise role of acoustic and semantic cues in complex speech perception tasks remains unclear. In this study, we propose a paradigm to understand the encoding of these cues in electroencephalogram (EEG) data, using match-mismatch (MM) classification task. The MM task involves determining whether the stimulus and response correspond to each other or not. We design a multi-modal sequence model, based on long short term memory (LSTM) architecture, to perform the MM task. The model is input with acoustic stimulus (derived from the speech envelope), semantic stimulus (derived from textual representations of the speech content), and neural response (derived from the EEG data). Our experiments are performed on two separate conditions, i) natural passive listening condition and, ii) an auditory attention based dichotic listening condition. Using the MM task as the analysis framework, we observe that - a) speech perception is fragmented based on word boundaries, b) acoustic and semantic cues offer similar levels of MM task performance in natural listening conditions, and c) semantic cues offer significantly improved MM classification over acoustic cues in dichotic listening task. Further, the study provides evidence of right ear advantage in dichotic listening conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar pre-existing SSL method and competitive against the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Attention is a vital cognitive process in the learning and memory environment, particularly in the context of online learning. Traditional methods for classifying attention states of online learners based on behavioral signals are prone to distortion, leading to increased interest in using electroencephalography (EEG) signals for authentic and accurate assessment. However, the field of attention state classification based on EEG signals in online learning faces challenges, including the scarcity of publicly available datasets, the lack of standardized data collection paradigms, and the requirement to consider the interplay between attention and other psychological states. In light of this, we present the Multi-label EEG dataset for classifying Mental Attention states (MEMA) in online learning. We meticulously designed a reliable and standard experimental paradigm with three attention states: neutral, relaxing, and concentrating, considering human physiological and psychological characteristics. This paradigm collected EEG signals from 20 subjects, each participating in 12 trials, resulting in 1,060 minutes of data.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study investigates the sleep characteristics and brain activity of individuals in the gray zone of insomnia, a population that experiences sleep disturbances yet does not fully meet the clinical criteria for chronic insomnia. Thirteen healthy participants and thirteen individuals from the gray zone were assessed using polysomnography and electroencephalogram to analyze both sleep architecture and neural activity. Although no significant differences in objective sleep quality or structure were found between the groups, gray zone individuals reported higher insomnia severity index scores, indicating subjective sleep difficulties. Electroencephalogram analysis revealed increased delta and alpha activity during the wake stage, suggesting lingering sleep inertia, while non-rapid eye movement stages 1 and 2 exhibited elevated beta and gamma activity, often associated with chronic insomnia. However, these high-frequency patterns were not observed in non-rapid eye movement stage 3 or rapid eye movement sleep, suggesting less severe disruptions compared to chronic insomnia. This study emphasizes that despite normal polysomnography findings, EEG patterns in gray zone individuals suggest a potential risk for chronic insomnia, highlighting the need for early identification and tailored intervention strategies to prevent progression.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for personalized brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, which can offer an enhanced user experience by customizing services to individual preferences and needs, based on endogenous electroencephalography (EEG) paradigms including motor imagery (MI), speech imagery (SI), and visual imagery. The framework includes two essential components: user identification and intention classification, which enable personalized services by identifying individual users and recognizing their intended actions through EEG signals. We validate the feasibility of our framework using a private EEG dataset collected from eight subjects, employing the ShallowConvNet architecture to decode EEG features. The experimental results demonstrate that user identification achieved an average classification accuracy of 0.995, while intention classification achieved 0.47 accuracy across all paradigms, with MI demonstrating the best performance. These findings indicate that EEG signals can effectively support personalized BCI applications, offering robust identification and reliable intention decoding, especially for MI and SI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have emphasized the promise of imagined speech and visual imagery as effective paradigms for intuitive communication. This study investigates the classification performance and brain connectivity patterns associated with these paradigms, focusing on decoding accuracy across selected word classes. Sixteen participants engaged in tasks involving thirteen imagined speech and visual imagery classes, revealing above-chance classification accuracy for both paradigms. Variability in classification accuracy across individual classes highlights the influence of sensory and motor associations in imagined speech and vivid visual associations in visual imagery. Connectivity analysis further demonstrated increased functional connectivity in language-related and sensory regions for imagined speech, whereas visual imagery activated spatial and visual processing networks. These findings suggest the potential of imagined speech and visual imagery as an intuitive and scalable paradigm for BCI communication when selecting optimal word classes. Further exploration of the decoding outcomes for these two paradigms could provide insights for practical BCI communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a computer. Most research so far studied more accurate BCIs, but much less attention has been paid to the ethics of BCIs. Aside from task-specific information, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, disorders, etc., which should be protected. Approach: We show for the first time that adding user-wise perturbations can make identity information in EEG unlearnable. We propose four types of user-wise privacy-preserving perturbations, i.e., random noise, synthetic noise, error minimization noise, and error maximization noise. After adding the proposed perturbations to EEG training data, the user identity information in the data becomes unlearnable, while the BCI task information remains unaffected. Main results: Experiments on six EEG datasets using three neural network classifiers and various traditional machine learning models demonstrated the robustness and practicability of the proposed perturbations. Significance: Our research shows the feasibility of hiding user identity information in EEG data without impacting the primary BCI task information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning has achieved great success in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Most existing BCI studies focused on improving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial security. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in other application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed that their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on benign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of data alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers simultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets from two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event related potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers (EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings (offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online cross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its effectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are usually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously improve the model accuracy and robustness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The significant inter-subject variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals often leads to knowledge being overwritten as new tasks are introduced in continual EEG decoding. While retraining on the entire dataset with each new input can prevent forgetting, this approach incurs high computational costs. An ideal brain-computer interface (BCI) model should continuously learn new information without retraining from scratch, thus reducing these costs. Most transfer learning models rely on large source-domain datasets for pre-training, yet data availability is frequently limited in real-world applications due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, such models are prone to catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a personalized subject-incremental learning (SIL) framework for continual EEG decoding that integrates Euclidean Alignment for fast domain adaptation, an exemplar replay mechanism to retain prior knowledge, and reservoir sampling-based memory management to handle memory constraints in long-term learning. Validated on the OpenBMI dataset with 54 subjects, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention with classification performance in continual MI-EEG tasks, offering a scalable solution for real-world BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of the Metaverse into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the need for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) that are driven by the multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct interaction between humans and computers by analyzing brain signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the non-invasive tools used in BCI systems, providing high temporal resolution for real-time applications. However, EEG signals are often affected by a low signal-to-noise ratio, physiological artifacts, and individual variability, representing challenges in extracting distinct features. Also, motor imagery (MI)-based EEG signals could contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics, which might cause the weights of the deep model to become biased towards those features. To address these problems, we proposed the end-to-end deep preprocessing method that effectively enhances MI characteristics while attenuating features with low correlation to MI characteristics. The proposed method consisted of the temporal, spatial, graph, and similarity blocks to preprocess MI-based EEG signals, aiming to extract more discriminative features and improve the robustness. We evaluated the proposed method using the public dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV to compare the performances when integrating the proposed method into the conventional models, including the DeepConvNet, the M-ShallowConvNet, and the EEGNet. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve the improved performances and lead to more clustered feature distributions of MI tasks. Hence, we demonstrated that our proposed method could enhance discriminative features related to MI characteristics.</td>

This study explores the neural signatures of motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) tasks using EEG signals, focusing on four conditions categorized as sense-related (hot and cold) and motor-related (pull and push) conditions. We conducted scalp topography analysis to examine activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, revealing distinct regional differences: sense--related conditions primarily activated the posterior region of the sensorimotor cortex, while motor--related conditions activated the anterior region of the sensorimotor cortex. These spatial distinctions align with neurophysiological principles, suggesting condition-specific functional subdivisions within the sensorimotor cortex. We further evaluated the performances of three neural network models-EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet-demonstrating that ME tasks achieved higher classification accuracies compared to MI tasks. Specifically, in sense-related conditions, the highest accuracy was observed in the cold condition. In motor-related conditions, the pull condition showed the highest performance, with DeepConvNet yielding the highest results. These findings provide insights into optimizing BCI applications by leveraging specific condition-induced neural activations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) enhances the interpretability of principal components (PCs) by imposing sparsity constraints on loading vectors (LVs). However, when used as a precursor to independent component analysis (ICA) for blind source separation (BSS), sPCA may underperform due to its focus on simplicity, potentially disregarding some statistical information essential for effective ICA. To overcome this limitation, a sophisticated approach is proposed that preserves the interpretability advantages of sPCA while significantly enhancing its source extraction capabilities. This consists of two tailored algorithms, dissociative PCA (DPCA1 and DPCA2), which employ adaptive and firm thresholding alongside gradient and coordinate descent approaches to optimize the proposed model dynamically. These algorithms integrate left and right singular vectors from singular value decomposition (SVD) through dissociation matrices (DMs) that replace traditional singular values, thus capturing latent interdependencies effectively to model complex source relationships. This leads to refined PCs and LVs that more accurately represent the underlying data structure. The proposed approach avoids focusing on individual eigenvectors, instead, it collaboratively combines multiple eigenvectors to disentangle interdependencies within each SVD variate. The superior performance of the proposed DPCA algorithms is demonstrated across four varied imaging applications including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) source retrieval, foreground-background separation, image reconstruction, and image inpainting. They outperformed traditional methods such as PCA+ICA, PPCA+ICA, SPCA+ICA, PMD, and GPower.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas jointly representing visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of early- and mid-level visual areas. RNC generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. A large portion of representational content was shared across areas, unique representational content increased with cortical distance, and we isolated the visual features determining these effects. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion is often described as something people 'feel' in their bodies. Embodied emotion theorists propose that this connection is not purely linguistic; perceiving an emotion may require somatosensory and motor re-experiencing. However, it remains unclear whether self-reports of emotion-related bodily sensations (i.e., 'lump in my throat') are related to neural simulations of bodily action and sensation or whether they can be explained by cognitive appraisals or the visual features of socioemotional signals. To investigate this, participants (N = 21) were shown arousing emotional images that varied in valence, complexity, and content while undergoing fMRI scans. Participants then rated the images on a set of emotion appraisal scales and indicated where, on a body map, they experienced sensation in response to the image. To derive normative models of responses on these scales, a separate larger online sample online (N = 56 - 128) also rated these images. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to compare the emotional content in the body maps with appraisals and visual features. A pairwise distance matrix between the body maps generated for each stimulus was then used in a whole brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis to identify brain regions which reflect the representational geometry of embodied emotion. This analysis revealed a network including bilateral primary somatosensory and motor cortices, precuneus, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between emotion and the body is not purely conceptual: It is supported by sensorimotor cortical activations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain connectivity alternations associated with brain disorders have been widely reported in resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous fusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural connectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better leverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood oxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by rs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships within the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish hetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community searching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further introduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances homo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information and preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the flexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data augmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue commonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective and superior to other algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.3%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Time series generation has emerged as an essential tool for analyzing temporal data across numerous fields. While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural decoding, the process of understanding how brain activity corresponds to different stimuli, has been a primary objective in cognitive sciences. Over the past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across the whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding stimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing. Additionally, we implemented zero-shot imagination decoding on an extra validation dataset, achieving a p-value of 0.0206 for mapping the reconstructed images and ground-truth text stimuli, which substantiates the model's capability to capture semantic meanings across various scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial strategy for white matter (WM) parcellation. Current methods primarily use the geometric information of fibers (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, overlooking the important functional signals present along the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), offering potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), that uses joint dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. It includes two major components: 1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from fiber geometric information and functional signals separately, and 2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the two kinds of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The observation of a resonance structure in the opening angle of the electron-positron pairs in the $^{7}$Li(p,\ee) $^{8}$Be reaction was claimed and interpreted as the production and subsequent decay of a hypothetical particle (X17). Similar excesses, consistent with this particle, were later observed in processes involving $^{4}$He and $^{12}$C nuclei with the same experimental technique. The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target. The $\gamma$ and the e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair emerging from the $^8\mathrm{Be}^*$ transitions were studied with calorimeters and a spectrometer, featuring a broader angular acceptance than previous experiments. We present in this paper the analysis of a four-week data-taking in 2023 with a beam energy of 1080 keV, resulting in the excitation of two different resonances with Q-value \SI{17.6}{\mega\electronvolt} and \SI{18.1}{\mega\electronvolt}. No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</td>

Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F. It can also simulate brain signals, thereby serving as a novel neural interface.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

This makes combining datasets and building models with inductive biases difficult as most datasets use different scanners and the sensor arrays have a nonintuitive spatial structure. In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well. We show that this enables spatial inductive biases, spatial data augmentations, better interpretability, zero-shot generalisation between datasets, and data harmonisation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this research, we explored the improvement in terms of multi-class disease classification via pre-trained language models over Medical-Abstracts-TC-Corpus that spans five medical conditions. We excluded non-cancer conditions and examined four specific diseases. We assessed four LLMs, BioBERT, XLNet, and BERT, as well as a novel base model (Last-BERT). BioBERT, which was pre-trained on medical data, demonstrated superior performance in medical text classification (97% accuracy). Surprisingly, XLNet followed closely (96% accuracy), demonstrating its generalizability across domains even though it was not pre-trained on medical data. LastBERT, a custom model based on the lighter version of BERT, also proved competitive with 87.10% accuracy (just under BERT's 89.33%). Our findings confirm the importance of specialized models such as BioBERT and also support impressions around more general solutions like XLNet and well-tuned transformer architectures with fewer parameters (in this case, LastBERT) in medical domain tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Imaging-based deep learning has transformed healthcare research, yet its clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges in comparing imaging models with traditional non-imaging and tabular data. To bridge this gap, we introduce Barttender, an interpretable framework that uses deep learning for the direct comparison of the utility of imaging versus non-imaging tabular data for tasks like disease prediction.   Barttender converts non-imaging tabular features, such as scalar data from electronic health records, into grayscale bars, facilitating an interpretable and scalable deep learning based modeling of both data modalities. Our framework allows researchers to evaluate differences in utility through performance measures, as well as local (sample-level) and global (population-level) explanations. We introduce a novel measure to define global feature importances for image-based deep learning models, which we call gIoU. Experiments on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets with chest X-rays and scalar data from electronic health records show that Barttender performs comparably to traditional methods and offers enhanced explainability using deep learning models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In order to support the creation of reliable machine learning models for anomaly detection, this project focuses on preprocessing, enhancing, and organizing a medical imaging dataset. There are two classifications in the dataset: normal and abnormal, along with extra noise fluctuations. In order to improve the photographs' quality, undesirable artifacts, including visible medical equipment at the edges, were eliminated using central cropping. Adjusting the brightness and contrast was one of the additional preprocessing processes. Normalization was then performed to normalize the data. To make classification jobs easier, the dataset was methodically handled by combining several image subsets into two primary categories: normal and pathological. To provide a strong training set that adapts well to real-world situations, sophisticated picture preprocessing techniques were used, such as contrast enhancement and real-time augmentation (including rotations, zooms, and brightness modifications). To guarantee efficient model evaluation, the data was subsequently divided into training and testing subsets. In order to create precise and effective machine learning models for medical anomaly detection, high-quality input data is ensured via this thorough approach. Because of the project pipeline's flexible and scalable design, it can be easily integrated with bigger clinical decision-support systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate segmentation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, the labor-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation limits the scalability of supervised learning with large datasets. Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) provides a promising alternative by leveraging image-level labels. In this study, we propose a novel WSSS approach that integrates structural guidance with text-driven strategies to generate high-quality pseudo labels, significantly improving segmentation performance. In terms of visual information, our method employs two processing modules that exchange raw image features and structural features from OCT images, guiding the model to identify where lesions are likely to occur. In terms of textual information, we utilize large-scale pretrained models from cross-domain sources to implement label-informed textual guidance and synthetic descriptive integration with two textual processing modules that combine local semantic features with consistent synthetic descriptions. By fusing these visual and textual components within a multimodal framework, our approach enhances lesion localization accuracy. Experimental results on three OCT datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in medical imaging. Although supervised learning techniques have proven to be effective in performing this task, they heavily depend on large amounts of annotated training data. The recently introduced Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables prompt-based segmentation and offers zero-shot generalization to unfamiliar objects. In our work, we leverage SAM's abstract object understanding for medical image segmentation to provide pseudo labels for semi-supervised learning, thereby mitigating the need for extensive annotated training data. Our approach refines initial segmentations that are derived from a limited amount of annotated data (comprising up to 43 cases) by extracting bounding boxes and seed points as prompts forwarded to SAM. Thus, it enables the generation of dense segmentation masks as pseudo labels for unlabelled data. The results show that training with our pseudo labels yields an improvement in Dice score from $74.29\,\%$ to $84.17\,\%$ and from $66.63\,\%$ to $74.87\,\%$ for the segmentation of bones of the paediatric wrist and teeth in dental radiographs, respectively. As a result, our method outperforms intensity-based post-processing methods, state-of-the-art supervised learning for segmentation (nnU-Net), and the semi-supervised mean teacher approach.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Untreated periodontitis causes inflammation within the supporting tissue of the teeth and can ultimately lead to tooth loss. Modeling periodontal outcomes is beneficial as they are difficult and time consuming to measure, but disparities in representation between demographic groups must be considered. There may not be enough participants to build group specific models and it can be ineffective, and even dangerous, to apply a model to participants in an underrepresented group if demographic differences were not considered during training. We propose an extension to RECaST Bayesian transfer learning framework. Our method jointly models multivariate outcomes, exhibiting significant improvement over the previous univariate RECaST method. Further, we introduce an online approach to model sequential data sets. Negative transfer is mitigated to ensure that the information shared from the other demographic groups does not negatively impact the modeling of the underrepresented participants. The Bayesian framework naturally provides uncertainty quantification on predictions. Especially important in medical applications, our method does not share data between domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification on simulated data and on a database of dental records from the HealthPartners Institute.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Causal effect estimation is a critical task in statistical learning that aims to find the causal effect on subjects by identifying causal links between a number of predictor (or, explanatory) variables and the outcome of a treatment. In a regressional framework, we assign a treatment and outcome model to estimate the average causal effect. Additionally, for high dimensional regression problems, variable selection methods are also used to find a subset of predictor variables that maximises the predictive performance of the underlying model for better estimation of the causal effect. In this paper, we propose a different approach. We focus on the variable selection aspects of high dimensional causal estimation problem. We suggest a cautious Bayesian group LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) framework for variable selection using prior sensitivity analysis. We argue that in some cases, abstaining from selecting (or, rejecting) a predictor is beneficial and we should gather more information to obtain a more decisive result. We also show that for problems with very limited information, expert elicited variable selection can give us a more stable causal effect estimation as it avoids overfitting. Lastly, we carry a comparative study with synthetic dataset and show the applicability of our method in real-life situations.</td>

Together, this integrated sen-sor system yields the effective electrical permittivity of the analyte particles. To simplify data analysis, 3D electrode arrangements were used instead of planar electrodes, so that the generated signal is unaffected by the height of the particle in the microfluidic channel. With this platform, we were able to distinguish between polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) microparticles.
