<td style='padding: 4px;'>OpenStreetMap (OSM), an online and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), is widely used for human self-localization by matching nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, due to the divergence in modalities and views, image-to-OSM (I2O) matching and localization remain challenging for robots, preventing the full utilization of VGI data in the unmanned ground vehicles and logistic industry. Inspired by the fact that the human brain relies on geometric and semantic understanding of sensory information for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired single-image visual localization method with semantic and geometric guidance to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method. Code, pre-trained models, CC validation benchmark, and additional results are available on: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/OSMLoc</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are responsible for the drainage of waste products from the human brain. An impairment in their functionality has been associated with aging as well as brain disorders like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. However, MLVs have only recently been described for the first time in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their ramified structure renders manual segmentation particularly difficult. Further, as there is no consistent notion of their appearance, human-annotated MLV structures contain a high inter-rater variability that most automatic segmentation methods cannot take into account. In this work, we propose a new rater-aware training scheme for the popular nnU-Net model, and we explore rater-based ensembling strategies for accurate and consistent segmentation of MLVs. This enables us to boost nnU-Net's performance while obtaining explicit predictions in different annotation styles and a rater-based uncertainty estimation. Our final model, MLV$^2$-Net, achieves a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.806 with respect to the human reference standard. The model further matches the human inter-rater reliability and replicates age-related associations with MLV volume.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain connectivity alternations associated with brain disorders have been widely reported in resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous fusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural connectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better leverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood oxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by rs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships within the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish hetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community searching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further introduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances homo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information and preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the flexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data augmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue commonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective and superior to other algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.3%.</td>

Subjects watched on average 2.6 Hollywood movies, for an average viewing time of 4.3 hours, and a total of 43 hours. The audio track for each movie was transcribed with manual corrections. Word onsets were manually annotated on spectrograms of the audio track for each movie. Each transcript was automatically parsed and manually corrected into the universal dependencies (UD) formalism, assigning a part of speech to every word and a dependency parse to every sentence. In total, subjects heard over 38,000 sentences (223,000 words), while they had on average 168 electrodes implanted. This is the largest dataset of intracranial recordings featuring grounded naturalistic language, one of the largest English UD treebanks in general, and one of only a few UD treebanks aligned to multimodal features. We hope that this dataset serves as a bridge between linguistic concepts, perception, and their neural representations. To that end, we present an analysis of which electrodes are sensitive to language features while also mapping out a rough time course of language processing across these electrodes.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides essential complementary information for analyzing brain tumor subregions. While methods using four common MRI modalities for automatic segmentation have shown success, they often face challenges with missing modalities due to image quality issues, inconsistent protocols, allergic reactions, or cost factors. Thus, developing a segmentation paradigm that handles missing modalities is clinically valuable. A novel single-modality parallel processing network framework based on H\"older divergence and mutual information is introduced. Each modality is independently input into a shared network backbone for parallel processing, preserving unique information. Additionally, a dynamic sharing framework is introduced that adjusts network parameters based on modality availability. A H\"older divergence and mutual information-based loss functions are used for evaluating discrepancies between predictions and labels. Extensive testing on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms existing techniques in handling missing modalities and validates each component's effectiveness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A wealth of studies report evidence that occipitotemporal cortex tessellates into "category-selective" brain regions that are apparently specialized for representing ecologically important visual stimuli like faces, bodies, scenes, and tools. Here, we argue that while valuable insights have been gained through the lens of category-selectivity, a more complete view of visual function in occipitotemporal cortex requires centering the behavioral relevance of visual properties in real-world environments rather than stimulus category. Focusing on behavioral relevance challenges a simple mapping between stimulus and visual function in occipitotemporal cortex because the environmental properties relevant to a behavior are visually diverse and how a given property is represented is modulated by our goals. Grounding our thinking in behavioral relevance rather than category-selectivity raises a host of theoretical and empirical issues that we discuss while providing proposals for how existing tools can be harnessed in this light to better understand visual function in occipitotemporal cortex.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>White matter tract segmentation is crucial for studying brain structural connectivity and neurosurgical planning. However, segmentation remains challenging due to issues like class imbalance between major and minor tracts, structural similarity, subject variability, symmetric streamlines between hemispheres etc. To address these challenges, we propose TractoEmbed, a modular multi-level embedding framework, that encodes localized representations through learning tasks in respective encoders. In this paper, TractoEmbed introduces a novel hierarchical streamline data representation that captures maximum spatial information at each level i.e. individual streamlines, clusters, and patches. Experiments show that TractoEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art methods in white matter tract segmentation across different datasets, and spanning various age groups. The modular framework directly allows the integration of additional embeddings in future works.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Speech enhancement plays an essential role in various applications, and the integration of visual information has been demonstrated to bring substantial advantages. However, the majority of current research concentrates on the examination of facial and lip movements, which can be compromised or entirely inaccessible in scenarios where occlusions occur or when the camera view is distant. Whereas contextual visual cues from the surrounding environment have been overlooked: for example, when we see a dog bark, our brain has the innate ability to discern and filter out the barking noise. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, i.e. SAV-SE. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposal to use rich contextual information from synchronized video as auxiliary cues to indicate the type of noise, which eventually improves the speech enhancement performance. Specifically, we propose the VC-S$^2$E method, which incorporates the Conformer and Mamba modules for their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments are conducted on public MUSIC, AVSpeech and AudioSet datasets, where the results demonstrate the superiority of VC-S$^2$E over other competitive methods. We will make the source code publicly available. Project demo page: https://AVSEPage.github.io/</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires the understanding of the relations between a wide range of disease-related features. Analyses that estimate these relations and evaluate their uncertainty are still rare. We address this gap by presenting a Bayesian approach using a Gaussian copula graphical model (GCGM). This model is able to estimate the relations between both continuous, discrete, and binary variables and compute the uncertainty of these estimates. Our method estimates the relations between brain-region specific gray matter volume and glucose uptake, amyloid levels, demographic information, and cognitive test scores. We applied our model to 1022 participants across different stages of AD. We found three indirect pathways through which old age reduces cognition: hippocampal volume loss, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) volume loss, and amyloid accumulation. Corrected for other variables, we found that women perform better on cognitive tests, but also discovered four indirect pathways that dampen this association in women: lower hippocampal volume, lower PCC volume, more amyloid accumulation and less education. We found limited relations between brain-region specific glucose uptake and cognition, but did discover that the hippocampus and PCC volumes are related to cognition. These results showcase that the novel use of GCGMs can offer valuable insights into AD pathogenesis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quality control of structures segmentation in volumetric medical images is important for identifying segmentation errors in clinical practice and for facilitating model development. This paper introduces SegQC, a novel framework for segmentation quality estimation and segmentation error detection. SegQC computes an estimate measure of the quality of a segmentation in volumetric scans and in their individual slices and identifies possible segmentation error regions within a slice. The key components include: 1. SegQC-Net, a deep network that inputs a scan and its segmentation mask and outputs segmentation error probabilities for each voxel in the scan; 2. three new segmentation quality metrics, two overlap metrics and a structure size metric, computed from the segmentation error probabilities; 3. a new method for detecting possible segmentation errors in scan slices computed from the segmentation error probabilities. We introduce a new evaluation scheme to measure segmentation error discrepancies based on an expert radiologist corrections of automatically produced segmentations that yields smaller observer variability and is closer to actual segmentation errors. We demonstrate SegQC on three fetal structures in 198 fetal MRI scans: fetal brain, fetal body and the placenta. To assess the benefits of SegQC, we compare it to the unsupervised Test Time Augmentation (TTA)-based quality estimation. Our studies indicate that SegQC outperforms TTA-based quality estimation in terms of Pearson correlation and MAE for fetal body and fetal brain structures segmentation. Our segmentation error detection method achieved recall and precision rates of 0.77 and 0.48 for fetal body, and 0.74 and 0.55 for fetal brain segmentation error detection respectively. SegQC enhances segmentation metrics estimation for whole scans and individual slices, as well as provides error regions detection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and Objective: Depression is a severe mental disorder, and accurate diagnosis is pivotal to the cure and rehabilitation of people with depression. However, the current questionnaire-based diagnostic methods could bring subjective biases and may be denied by subjects. In search of a more objective means of diagnosis, researchers have begun to experiment with deep learning-based methods for identifying depressive disorders in recent years. Methods: In this study, a novel Spatiotemporal-fused network with Automated multi-scale Depth-wise and TIME-interval-related common feature extractor (SAD-TIME) is proposed. SAD-TIME incorporates an automated nodes' common features extractor (CFE), a spatial sector (SpS), a modified temporal sector (TeS), and a domain adversarial learner (DAL). The CFE includes a multi-scale depth-wise 1D-convolutional neural network and a time-interval embedding generator, where the unique information of each channel is preserved. The SpS fuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity containing spatial position of EEG electrodes. A multi-head-attention graph convolutional network is also applied in the SpS to fuse the features from different EEG channels. The TeS is based on long short-term memory and graph transformer networks, where the temporal information of different time-windows is fused. Moreover, the DAL is used after the SpS to obtain the domain-invariant feature. Results: Experimental results under tenfold cross-validation show that the proposed SAD-TIME method achieves 92.00% and 94.00% depression classification accuracies on two datasets, respectively, in cross-subject mode. Conclusion: SAD-TIME is a robust depression detection model, where the automatedly-generated features, the SpS and the TeS assist the classification performance with the fusion of the innate spatiotemporal information in the EEG signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding the directional focus of an attended speaker from listeners' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for developing brain-computer interfaces to improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment. Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus decoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or right side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, we observe that, on our recently presented dataset with 15-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibits significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved. We employ the CNN, LSM-CNN, and EEG-Deformer models to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals with the auxiliary audio spatial spectra. The proposed Sp-Aux-Deformer model achieves notable 15-class decoding accuracies of 57.48% and 61.83% in leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet its effects on neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the impact of tDCS in individuals with MDD using resting-state EEG data and network neuroscience to analyze functional connectivity. We examined power spectral density (PSD) changes and functional connectivity (FC) patterns across theta, alpha, and beta bands before and after tDCS intervention. A notable aspect of this research involves the modification of the binarizing threshold algorithm to assess functional connectivity networks, facilitating a meaningful comparison at the group level. Our analysis using optimal threshold binarization techniques revealed significant modifications in network topology, particularly evident in the beta band, indicative of reduced randomization or enhanced small-worldness after tDCS. Furthermore, the hubness analysis identified specific brain regions, notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions across all frequency bands, exhibiting increased functional connectivity, suggesting their involvement in the antidepressant effects of tDCS. Notably, tDCS intervention transformed the dispersed high connectivity into localized connectivity and increased left-sided asymmetry across all frequency bands. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of tDCS on neural mechanisms in MDD, offering a potential direction for further research and therapeutic development in the field of neuromodulation for mental health disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion decoding can objectively quantify people's emotional state and has broad application prospects in human-computer interaction and early detection of emotional disorders. Recently emerging deep learning architectures have significantly improved the performance of EEG emotion decoding. However, existing methods still fall short of fully capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of neural signals, which are crucial for representing emotion processing. This study proposes a Dynamic-Attention-based EEG State Transition (DAEST) modeling method to characterize EEG spatiotemporal dynamics. The model extracts spatiotemporal components of EEG that represent multiple parallel neural processes and estimates dynamic attention weights on these components to capture transitions in brain states. The model is optimized within a contrastive learning framework for cross-subject emotion recognition. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets: FACED, SEED, and SEED-V. It achieved 75.4% accuracy in the binary classification of positive and negative emotions and 59.3% in nine-class discrete emotion classification on the FACED dataset, 88.1% in the three-class classification of positive, negative, and neutral emotions on the SEED dataset, and 73.6% in five-class discrete emotion classification on the SEED-V dataset. The learned EEG spatiotemporal patterns and dynamic transition properties offer valuable insights into neural dynamics underlying emotion processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>State-of-the-art methods for explaining predictions based on time series are built on learning an instance-wise saliency mask for each time step. However, for many types of time series, the salient information is found in the frequency domain. Adopting existing methods to the frequency domain involves naively zeroing out frequency content in the signals, which goes against established signal processing theory.   Therefore, we propose a new method entitled FLEXtime, that uses a filterbank to split the time series into frequency bands and learns the optimal combinations of these bands. FLEXtime avoids the drawbacks of zeroing out frequency bins and is more stable and easier to train compared to the naive method. Our extensive evaluation shows that FLEXtime on average outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the time series explainability literature and can provide a valuable tool for a wide range of time series like EEG and audio.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to become an essential tool in supporting clinical decision-making processes, offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities and personalized treatment plans. However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning has achieved great success in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Most existing BCI studies focused on improving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial security. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in other application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed that their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on benign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of data alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers simultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets from two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event related potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers (EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings (offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online cross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its effectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are usually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously improve the model accuracy and robustness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we address the challenges in automatic sleep stage classification, particularly the high computational cost, inadequate modeling of bidirectional temporal dependencies, and class imbalance issues faced by Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of the Metaverse into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the need for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) that are driven by the multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies.</td>

This study explores the neural signatures of motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) tasks using EEG signals, focusing on four conditions categorized as sense-related (hot and cold) and motor-related (pull and push) conditions. We conducted scalp topography analysis to examine activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, revealing distinct regional differences: sense--related conditions primarily activated the posterior region of the sensorimotor cortex, while motor--related conditions activated the anterior region of the sensorimotor cortex. These spatial distinctions align with neurophysiological principles, suggesting condition-specific functional subdivisions within the sensorimotor cortex. We further evaluated the performances of three neural network models-EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet-demonstrating that ME tasks achieved higher classification accuracies compared to MI tasks. Specifically, in sense-related conditions, the highest accuracy was observed in the cold condition. In motor-related conditions, the pull condition showed the highest performance, with DeepConvNet yielding the highest results. These findings provide insights into optimizing BCI applications by leveraging specific condition-induced neural activations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The rapid evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human-computer interaction, with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</td>

This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain connectivity alternations associated with brain disorders have been widely reported in resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous fusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural connectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better leverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood oxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by rs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships within the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish hetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community searching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further introduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances homo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information and preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the flexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data augmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue commonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective and superior to other algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.3%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Time series generation has emerged as an essential tool for analyzing temporal data across numerous fields. While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets. We have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting and MuJoCo imputation tasks, significantly enhanced by our innovative $t$ power sampling method.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural decoding, the process of understanding how brain activity corresponds to different stimuli, has been a primary objective in cognitive sciences. Over the past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across the whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding stimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing. Additionally, we implemented zero-shot imagination decoding on an extra validation dataset, achieving a p-value of 0.0206 for mapping the reconstructed images and ground-truth text stimuli, which substantiates the model's capability to capture semantic meanings across various scenarios.</td>

In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial strategy for white matter (WM) parcellation. Current methods primarily use the geometric information of fibers (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, overlooking the important functional signals present along the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), offering potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), that uses joint dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. It includes two major components: 1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from fiber geometric information and functional signals separately, and 2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the two kinds of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We investigate whether and how we can improve the cost efficiency of neuroimaging studies with well-tailored fMRI tasks. The comparative study is conducted using a novel network science-driven Bayesian connectome-based predictive method, which incorporates network theories in model building and substantially improves precision and robustness in imaging biomarker detection. The robustness of the method lays the foundation for identifying predictive power differential across fMRI task conditions if such difference exists. When applied to a clinically heterogeneous transdiagnostic cohort, we found shared and distinct functional fingerprints of neuropsychological outcomes across seven fMRI conditions. For example, emotional N-back memory task was found to be less optimal for negative emotion outcomes, and gradual-onset continuous performance task was found to have stronger links with sensitivity and sociability outcomes than with cognitive control outcomes. Together, our results show that there are unique optimal pairings of task-based fMRI conditions and neuropsychological outcomes that should not be ignored when designing well-powered neuroimaging studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To understand collective network behavior in the complex human brain, pairwise correlation networks alone are insufficient for capturing the high-order interactions that extend beyond pairwise interactions and play a crucial role in brain network dynamics. These interactions often reveal intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science. Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role in information integration within the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human brain dynamically integrated and configured information to adapt to the environment. To capture these changes over time, dynamic second-order functional connectivity was typically used to capture transient brain patterns. However, dynamic second-order functional connectivity typically ignored interactions beyond pairwise relationships. To address this limitation, we utilized dynamic triple interactions to investigate multiscale network interactions in the brain. In this study, we evaluated a resting-state fMRI dataset that included individuals with psychotic disorders (PD). We first estimated dynamic triple interactions using resting-state fMRI. After clustering, we estimated cohort-specific and cohort-common states for controls (CN), schizophrenia (SZ), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD). From the cohort-specific states, we observed significant triple interactions, particularly among visual, subcortical, and somatomotor networks, as well as temporal and higher cognitive networks in SZ. In SAD, key interactions involved temporal networks in the initial state and somatomotor networks in subsequent states. From the cohort-common states, we observed that high-cognitive networks were primarily involved in SZ and SAD compared to CN. Furthermore, the most significant differences between SZ and SAD also existed in high-cognitive networks. In summary, we studied PD using dynamic triple interaction, the first time such an approach has been used to study PD. Our findings highlighted the significant potential of dynamic high-order functional connectivity, paving the way for new avenues in the study of the healthy and disordered human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain networks/graphs derived from resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) help study underlying pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders by measuring neuronal activities in the brain. Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent large language models (LLMs) have excelled across a wide range of tasks, but their use in high-stakes and compute-limited settings has intensified the demand for interpretability and efficiency. We address this need by proposing Induction-head ngram models (Induction-Gram), a method that builds an efficient, interpretable LM by bolstering modern ngram models with a hand-engineered "induction head". This induction head uses a custom neural similarity metric to efficiently search the model's input context for potential next-word completions. This process enables Induction-Gram to provide ngram-level grounding for each generated token. Moreover, experiments show that this simple method significantly improves next-word prediction over baseline interpretable models (up to 26%p) and can be used to speed up LLM inference for large models through speculative decoding. We further study Induction-Gram in a natural-language neuroscience setting, where the goal is to predict the next fMRI response in a sequence. It again provides a significant improvement over interpretable models (20% relative increase in the correlation of predicted fMRI responses), potentially enabling deeper scientific investigation of language selectivity in the brain.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The observation of a resonance structure in the opening angle of the electron-positron pairs in the $^{7}$Li(p,\ee) $^{8}$Be reaction was claimed and interpreted as the production and subsequent decay of a hypothetical particle (X17). Similar excesses, consistent with this particle, were later observed in processes involving $^{4}$He and $^{12}$C nuclei with the same experimental technique. The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target. The $\gamma$ and the e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair emerging from the $^8\mathrm{Be}^*$ transitions were studied with calorimeters and a spectrometer, featuring a broader angular acceptance than previous experiments. We present in this paper the analysis of a four-week data-taking in 2023 with a beam energy of 1080 keV, resulting in the excitation of two different resonances with Q-value \SI{17.6}{\mega\electronvolt} and \SI{18.1}{\mega\electronvolt}. No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</td>

Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well. We show that this enables spatial inductive biases, spatial data augmentations, better interpretability, zero-shot generalisation between datasets, and data harmonisation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Aggregating large-scale radiotherapy planning and delivery data is crucial for advancing radiation oncology research and improving clinical practice, yet challenges persist due to the diversity of treatment planning systems (TPS), record and verify (R&V) systems, and complex data formats lacking standardized retrieval methods. We developed a robust software framework that automates the collection and integration of multi-institutional radiotherapy data from diverse TPS and R&V systems. By utilizing the unidirectional references of DICOM objects, our framework reconstructs complete patient datasets starting from Radiotherapy Treatment Records (RTRECORDs), managing tasks such as data queries, transfers, verification, and logging. It effectively maps DICOM linkages between RTRECORDs, RTPLANs, RTDOSEs, RTSTRUCTs, planning images, registrations, and associated diagnostic images, incorporating custom modules for data conversion and comprehensive error handling. Implemented across multiple institutions using various systems$-$ including ARIA, Eclipse, MOSAIQ, RayStation, MIM, Pinnacle$-$ the framework successfully collected data from two clinics over an 11-year period, aggregating data from 6,022 patients and 13,871 treatment plans with a success rate of 99.76% and an average processing time of approximately 18 minutes per patient. Ongoing efforts are extending data collection to clinics lacking DICOM Query/Retrieve capabilities, demonstrating the framework's adaptability to various clinical environments. This efficient automation of comprehensive data collection overcomes significant technical barriers, facilitating the creation of large-scale datasets that can accelerate advancements in radiation oncology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question-answering (QA). For instance, across all tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 22.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 36.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 40.5% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Meanwhile, we find that after fine-tuning on specific QA tasks, medical LLMs can show performance improvements, but the benefits do not carry over to tasks based on clinical notes. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>French language models, such as CamemBERT, have been widely adopted across industries for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, with models like CamemBERT seeing over 4 million downloads per month. However, these models face challenges due to temporal concept drift, where outdated training data leads to a decline in performance, especially when encountering new topics and terminology. This issue emphasizes the need for updated models that reflect current linguistic trends. In this paper, we introduce two new versions of the CamemBERT base model-CamemBERTav2 and CamemBERTv2-designed to address these challenges. CamemBERTav2 is based on the DeBERTaV3 architecture and makes use of the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) objective for better contextual understanding, while CamemBERTv2 is built on RoBERTa, which uses the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective. Both models are trained on a significantly larger and more recent dataset with longer context length and an updated tokenizer that enhances tokenization performance for French. We evaluate the performance of these models on both general-domain NLP tasks and domain-specific applications, such as medical field tasks, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness across a range of use cases. Our results show that these updated models vastly outperform their predecessors, making them valuable tools for modern NLP systems. All our new models, as well as intermediate checkpoints, are made openly available on Huggingface.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Radiotherapy commonly relies on CT, but there is growing interest in using hybrid PET/MR. Therefore, dedicated hardware setups have been proposed for PET/MR systems which enable imaging in radiotherapy treatment position. These radiotherapy setups typically include a flat tabletop, positioning tools and coil holders specifically tailored to the devices. However, reduced MR image quality has been reported. Especially in neck and upper thorax, conventional radiotherapy setups are not optimal as they consist of head-only coil configurations. The purpose was to develop a novel PET/MR radiotherapy setup for improved MR image quality in head, neck and thorax and to test compliance in a multicenter setting. Methods: A novel radiotherapy setup was designed, prototyped and tested on a 3T PET/MR system in three different centers. Imaging experiments were conducted in phantoms and healthy volunteers to compare against a standard radiotherapy setup. Imaging protocols included T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MR (DWI). Finally, compliance with American College of Radiology (ACR) and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) acceptance criteria was evaluated. Results: SNR in neck/thorax was increased by a factor of 1.6 in phantom (p = 0.031) and volunteer images alike. The new setup passed ACR detectability and QIBA SNR tests, which the standard setup failed. The new setup passed all but two ACR test criteria in the three centers, presented repeatability and reproducibility variations of 4.9% and 7.8% and met all QIBA criteria for DWI except ADC precision. Conclusion: The proposed setup yielded significantly higher SNR, better detectability, and complied with nearly all ACR and QIBA image quality criteria. It may thus advance the usage of PET/MR for radiotherapy purposes.</td>

This paper provides a systematic review of vision autoregressive models, including the development of a taxonomy of existing methods and highlighting their major contributions, strengths, and limitations, covering various vision tasks such as image generation, video generation, image editing, motion generation, medical image analysis, 3D generation, robotic manipulation, unified multimodal generation, etc. Besides, we investigate and analyze the latest advancements in autoregressive models, including thorough benchmarking and discussion of existing methods across various evaluation datasets. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising directions for future research, offering a roadmap to guide further advancements in vision autoregressive models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) and similar models build a family of promptable foundation models (FMs) for image and video segmentation. The object of interest is identified using prompts, such as bounding boxes or points. With these FMs becoming part of medical image segmentation, extensive evaluation studies are required to assess their strengths and weaknesses in clinical setting. Since the performance is highly dependent on the chosen prompting strategy, it is important to investigate different prompting techniques to define optimal guidelines that ensure effective use in medical image segmentation. Currently, no dedicated evaluation studies exist specifically for bone segmentation in CT scans, leaving a gap in understanding the performance for this task. Thus, we use non-iterative, ``optimal'' prompting strategies composed of bounding box, points and combinations to test the zero-shot capability of SAM-family models for bone CT segmentation on three different skeletal regions. Our results show that the best settings depend on the model type and size, dataset characteristics and objective to optimize. Overall, SAM and SAM2 prompted with a bounding box in combination with the center point for all the components of an object yield the best results across all tested settings. As the results depend on multiple factors, we provide a guideline for informed decision-making in 2D prompting with non-interactive, ''optimal'' prompts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Summarizing patient clinical notes is vital for reducing documentation burdens. Current manual summarization makes medical staff struggle. We propose an automatic method using LLMs, but long inputs cause LLMs to lose context, reducing output quality especially in small size model. We used a 7B model, open-calm-7b, enhanced with Native Bayes Context Extend and a redesigned decoding mechanism to reference one sentence at a time, keeping inputs within context windows, 2048 tokens. Our improved model achieved near parity with Google's over 175B Gemini on ROUGE-L metrics with 200 samples, indicating strong performance using less resources, enhancing automated EMR summarization feasibility.</td>
