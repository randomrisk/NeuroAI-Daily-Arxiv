<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper investigates the controllability properties of a general class of recurrent neural networks that are widely used for hypothesis generation in theoretical neuroscience, including the modeling of large-scale human brain dynamics. Our study focuses on the control synthesis of such networks using constant and piecewise constant inputs, motivated by emerging applications in non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The neural network model considered is a continuous Hopfield-type system with nonlinear activation functions and arbitrary input matrices representing interactions among multiple brain regions. Our main contribution is the formulation and solution of a control synthesis problem for these nonlinear systems. We provide a proper generalization of the variation of the constants formula that constitutes a novel representation of the system's state trajectory. This representation admits a verifiable condition on the existence of the constant control input to solve a short-time two-point boundary value problem in the state space. This formulation admits a synthesis for the input in question, which can be realized using modern algorithmic optimization tools. In the case of linear activation functions, this analysis and synthesis reduces to the verification of algebraic conditions on the system matrices. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies. These results offer a novel control synthesis for an important class of neural network models that may, in turn, enable the design of brain stimulation protocols to modulate whole-brain activity in therapeutic and cognitive enhancement applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can lead to stroke and dementia. Stroke is the second leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasing by the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain imaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain atrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management and intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and dementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support radiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered commercially available software and research publications which identify at least two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13 research publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were available: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and ischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of patient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and longitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently analysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS were each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially available systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research systems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH and atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD markers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validated systems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive joint analysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB, and atrophy).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI studies employ chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) or spin lock (CESL) to study glucose uptake. Currently, these methods are hampered by low effect size and sensitivity to motion. To overcome this, we propose to utilize exchange-based linewidth (LW) broadening of the direct water saturation (DS) curve of the water saturation spectrum (Z-spectrum) during and after glucose infusion (DS-DGE MRI). Methods: To estimate the glucose-infusion-induced LW changes ($\Delta$LW), Bloch-McConnell simulations were performed for normoglycemia and hyperglycemia in blood, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), CSF, and malignant tumor tissue. Whole-brain DS-DGE imaging was implemented at 3 tesla using dynamic Z-spectral acquisitions (1.2 s per offset frequency, 38 s per spectrum) and assessed on four brain tumor patients using infusion of 35 g of D-glucose. To assess $\Delta$LW, a deep learning-based Lorentzian fitting approach was employed on voxel-based DS spectra acquired before, during, and post-infusion. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) images, obtained from the dynamic $\Delta$LW time curves, were compared qualitatively to perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). Results: In simulations, $\Delta$LW was 1.3%, 0.30%, 0.29/0.34%, 7.5%, and 13% in arterial blood, venous blood, GM/WM, malignant tumor tissue, and CSF, respectively. In vivo, $\Delta$LW was approximately 1% in GM/WM, 5-20% for different tumor types, and 40% in CSF. The resulting DS-DGE AUC maps clearly outlined lesion areas. Conclusions: DS-DGE MRI is highly promising for assessing D-glucose uptake. Initial results in brain tumor patients show high-quality AUC maps of glucose-induced line broadening and DGE-based lesion enhancement similar and/or complementary to PWI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain age transformation aims to convert reference brain images into synthesized images that accurately reflect the age-specific features of a target age group. The primary objective of this task is to modify only the age-related attributes of the reference image while preserving all other age-irrelevant attributes. However, achieving this goal poses substantial challenges due to the inherent entanglement of various image attributes within features extracted from a backbone encoder, resulting in simultaneous alterations during the image generation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture that employs disentangled representation learning for identity-preserved brain age transformation called IdenBAT. This approach facilitates the decomposition of image features, ensuring the preservation of individual traits while selectively transforming age-related characteristics to match those of the target age group. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on both 2D and full-size 3D brain datasets, our method adeptly converts input images to target age while retaining individual characteristics accurately. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superiority over existing state-of-the-art regarding performance fidelity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurological disorder. However, the multi-faceted symptoms and large individual differences among ASD patients are hindering the diagnosis process, which largely relies on subject descriptions and lacks quantitative biomarkers. To remediate such problems, this paper explores the use of graph theory and topological data analysis (TDA) to study brain activity in ASD patients and normal controls. We employ the Mapper algorithm in TDA and the distance correlation graphical model (DCGM) in graph theory to create brain state networks, then innovatively adopt complex network metrics in Graph signal processing (GSP) and physical quantities to analyze brain activities over time. Our findings reveal statistical differences in network characteristics between ASD and control groups. Compared to normal subjects, brain state networks of ASD patients tend to have decreased modularity, higher von Neumann entropy, increased Betti-0 numbers, and decreased Betti-1 numbers. These findings attest to the biological traits of ASD, suggesting less transitioning in brain dynamics. These findings offer potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis and deepen our understanding of its neural correlations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In certain brain volumetric studies, synthetic T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) contrast, derived from quantitative T1 MRI (T1-qMRI), proves highly valuable due to its clear white/gray matter boundaries for brain segmentation. However, generating synthetic MP-RAGE (syn-MP-RAGE) typically requires pairs of high-quality, artifact-free, multi-modality inputs, which can be challenging in retrospective studies, where missing or corrupted data is common. To overcome this limitation, our research explores the feasibility of employing a deep learning-based approach to synthesize syn-MP-RAGE contrast directly from a single channel turbo spin-echo (TSE) input, renowned for its resistance to metal artifacts. We evaluated this deep learning-based synthetic MP-RAGE (DL-Syn-MPR) on 31 non-artifact and 11 metal-artifact subjects. The segmentation results, measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), consistently achieved high agreement (DSC values above 0.83), indicating a strong correlation with reference segmentations, with lower input requirements. Also, no significant difference in segmentation performance was observed between the artifact and non-artifact groups.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work explores how human judgement about salient regions of an image can be introduced into deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) training. Traditionally, training of DCNNs is purely data-driven. This often results in learning features of the data that are only coincidentally correlated with class labels. Human saliency can guide network training using our proposed new component of the loss function that ConveYs Brain Oversight to Raise Generalization (CYBORG) and penalizes the model for using non-salient regions. This mechanism produces DCNNs achieving higher accuracy and generalization compared to using the same training data without human salience. Experimental results demonstrate that CYBORG applies across multiple network architectures and problem domains (detection of synthetic faces, iris presentation attacks and anomalies in chest X-rays), while requiring significantly less data than training without human saliency guidance. Visualizations show that CYBORG-trained models' saliency is more consistent across independent training runs than traditionally-trained models, and also in better agreement with humans. To lower the cost of collecting human annotations, we also explore using deep learning to provide automated annotations. CYBORG training of CNNs addresses important issues such as reducing the appetite for large training sets, increasing interpretability, and reducing fragility by generalizing better to new types of data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) show limited performance with scarce or imbalanced training data and face challenges with continuous learning, such as forgetting previously learned data after new tasks training. In contrast, the human brain can learn continuously and from just a few examples. This research explores the impact of 'sleep', an unsupervised phase incorporating stochastic activation with local Hebbian learning rules, on ANNs trained incrementally with limited and imbalanced datasets, specifically MNIST and Fashion MNIST. We discovered that introducing a sleep phase significantly enhanced accuracy in models trained with limited data. When a few tasks were trained sequentially, sleep replay not only rescued previously learned information that had been catastrophically forgetting following new task training but often enhanced performance in prior tasks, especially those trained with limited data. This study highlights the multifaceted role of sleep replay in augmenting learning efficiency and facilitating continual learning in ANNs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain processes dynamic natural stimuli remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Current dynamic neural encoding models either take stimuli as input but ignore shared variability in neural responses, or they model this variability by deriving latent embeddings from neural responses or behavior while ignoring the visual input. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic model that incorporates video inputs along with stimulus-independent latent factors to capture variability in neuronal responses, predicting a joint distribution for the entire population. After training and testing our model on mouse V1 neuronal responses, we found that it outperforms video-only models in terms of log-likelihood and achieves further improvements when conditioned on responses from other neurons. Furthermore, we find that the learned latent factors strongly correlate with mouse behavior, although the model was trained without behavior data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is crucial for auditory attention decoding to classify matched and mismatched speech stimuli with corresponding EEG responses by exploring their relationship. However, existing methods often adopt two independent networks to encode speech stimulus and EEG response, which neglect the relationship between these signals from the two modalities. In this paper, we propose an independent feature enhanced crossmodal fusion model (IFE-CF) for match-mismatch classification, which leverages the fusion feature of the speech stimulus and the EEG response to achieve auditory EEG decoding. Specifically, our IFE-CF contains a crossmodal encoder to encode the speech stimulus and the EEG response with a two-branch structure connected via crossmodal attention mechanism in the encoding process, a multi-channel fusion module to fuse features of two modalities by aggregating the interaction feature obtained from the crossmodal encoder and the independent feature obtained from the speech stimulus and EEG response, and a predictor to give the matching result. In addition, the causal mask is introduced to consider the time delay of the speech-EEG pair in the crossmodal encoder, which further enhances the feature representation for match-mismatch classification. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness with better classification accuracy, as compared with the baseline of the Auditory EEG Decoding Challenge 2023.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG preprocessing varies widely between studies, but its impact on stimulus classification performance remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyzed seven experiments with 40 participants drawn from the public ERP CORE dataset. We systematically varied key preprocessing steps, such as filtering, referencing, baseline interval, detrending, and multiple artifact correction steps. Then we performed trial-wise binary classification (i.e., decoding) using neural networks (EEGNet), or time-resolved logistic regressions. Our findings demonstrate that preprocessing choices influenced decoding performance considerably. All artifact correction steps reduced decoding performance across all experiments and models, while higher high-pass filter cutoffs consistently enhanced decoding. For EEGNet, baseline correction further improved performance, and for time-resolved classifiers, linear detrending and lower low-pass filter cutoffs were beneficial. Other optimal preprocessing choices were specific for each experiment. The current results underline the importance of carefully selecting preprocessing steps for EEG-based decoding. If not corrected, artifacts facilitate decoding but compromise conclusive interpretation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mother-child interaction is a highly dynamic process neurally characterized by inter-brain synchrony (IBS) at {\theta} and/or {\alpha} rhythms. However, their establishment, dynamic changes, and roles in mother-child interactions remain unknown. Through dynamic analysis of dual-EEG from 40 mother-child dyads during turn-taking cooperation, we uncover that {\theta}-IBS and {\alpha}-IBS alternated with interactive behaviors, with EEG frequency-shift as a prerequisite for IBS transitions. When mothers attempt to track their children's attention and/or predict their intentions, they will adjust their EEG frequencies to align with their children's {\theta} oscillations, leading to a higher occurrence of the {\theta}-IBS state. Conversely, the {\alpha}-IBS state, accompanied by the EEG frequency-shift to the {\alpha} range, is more prominent during mother-led interactions. Further exploratory analysis reveals greater presence and stability of the {\theta}-IBS state during cooperative than non-cooperative conditions, particularly in dyads with stronger emotional attachments and more frequent interactions in their daily lives. Our findings shed light on the neural oscillational substrates underlying the IBS dynamics during mother-child interactions.</td>

This study investigates the neurophysiological responses to Augmented Reality safety warnings in roadway work zones under varying workload conditions. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, we objectively assessed situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load in simulated low-intensity (LA) and moderate-intensity (MA) work activities. The research analyzed key EEG indicators including beta, gamma, alpha, and theta waves, as well as various combined wave ratios. Results revealed that AR warnings effectively triggered neurological responses associated with increased situational awareness and attention across both workload conditions. However, significant differences were observed in the timing and intensity of these responses. In the LA condition, peak responses occurred earlier (within 125 ms post-warning) and were more pronounced, suggesting a more robust cognitive response when physical demands were lower. Conversely, the MA condition showed delayed peak responses (125-250 ms post-warning) and more gradual changes, indicating a potential impact of increased physical activity on cognitive processing speed. These findings underscore the importance of considering physical workload when designing AR-based safety systems for roadway work zones. The research contributes to the understanding of how AR can enhance worker safety and provides insights for developing more effective, context-aware safety interventions in high-risk work environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>During clinical treatment for epilepsy, the area of the brain thought to be responsible for pathological activity - known as the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is identified. This is typically performed through visual assessment of EEG recordings; however, this is time consuming and prone to subjective inconsistency. Automated SOZ localisation algorithms provide objective identification of the SOZ by highlighting changes in signal features associated with seizure onset. In this work we investigate how methodological differences in such algorithms can result in different SOZ localisations.   We analysed ictal intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings in 16 subjects (100 seizures) with drug-resistant epilepsy from the SWEZ-ETHZ public database. Through our analysis, we identified a series of key methodological differences that must be considered when designing or selecting a SOZ localisation algorithm. These differences were demonstrated using three distinct algorithms that capture different, but complementary, seizure onset features: Imprint, Epileptogenicity Index (EI), and Low Entropy Map (LEM). We assessed methodological differences at each Decision Point, comparing the resultant SOZ localisations.   Our independent application of all three algorithms to the same ictal icEEG dataset revealed low agreement between algorithms: 27-60% of seizure onsets were as minimally or non-overlapping (<25% overlap). Therefore, we investigated the effect of three key methodological differences (or Decision Points). Changes at each Decision Point were found to result in significantly different SOZ localisations (p<0.05).   Our results demonstrate how seemingly small methodological changes can result in large differences in SOZ localisations. We propose that key Decision Points must be considered when using or designing a SOZ localisation algorithm.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Auditory attention decoding (AAD) is the process of identifying the attended speech in a multi-talker environment using brain signals, typically recorded through electroencephalography (EEG). Over the past decade, AAD has undergone continuous development, driven by its promising application in neuro-steered hearing devices. Most AAD algorithms are relying on the increase in neural entrainment to the envelope of attended speech, as compared to unattended speech, typically using a two-step approach. First, the algorithm predicts representations of the attended speech signal envelopes; second, it identifies the attended speech by finding the highest correlation between the predictions and the representations of the actual speech signals. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, named AADNet, which combines these two stages into a direct approach to address the AAD problem. We compare the proposed network against the traditional approaches, including linear stimulus reconstruction, canonical correlation analysis, and an alternative non-linear stimulus reconstruction using two different datasets. AADNet shows a significant performance improvement for both subject-specific and subject-independent models. Notably, the average subject-independent classification accuracies from 56.1 % to 82.7 % with analysis window lengths ranging from 1 to 40 seconds, respectively, show a significantly improved ability to generalize to data from unseen subjects. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models for advancing AAD, with promising implications for future hearing aids, assistive devices, and clinical assessments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The rapid evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human-computer interaction, with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG)--based turn intention prediction for lower limb movement is important to build an efficient brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants. The decoding analysis shows the feasibility of turn intention prediction for lower limb movement using the EEG signal before the event onset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.</td>

The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on voluntary right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct interaction between users and computers by decoding brain signals. This study addresses the challenges of detecting P300 event-related potentials in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and integrating these P300 responses for character spelling, particularly within oddball paradigms characterized by uneven P300 distribution, low target probability, and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work proposes a weighted ensemble spatio-sequential convolutional neural network (WE-SPSQ-CNN) to improve classification accuracy and SNR by mitigating signal variability for character identification. We evaluated the proposed WE-SPSQ-CNN on dataset II from the BCI Competition III, achieving P300 classification accuracies of 69.7\% for subject A and 79.9\% for subject B across fifteen epochs. For character recognition, the model achieved average accuracies of 76.5\%, 87.5\%, and 94.5\% with five, ten, and fifteen repetitions, respectively.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a technique used to optimize and reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of machine learning models. It has been used primarily for neural networks. For Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that are fully portable and usable in various situations, it is necessary to provide approaches that are lightweight for storage and computation. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of post-training quantization on state-of-the-art approaches in brain-computer interfaces and assess their impact on accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the single-trial detection of event-related potentials representing one major BCI paradigm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve drops from 0.861 to 0.825 with PTQ when applied on both spatial filters and the classifier, while reducing the size of the model by about $\times$ 15. The results support the conclusion that PTQ can substantially reduce the memory footprint of the models while keeping roughly the same level of accuracy.</td>

Yet, a mechanistic computational model of each individual learning trajectory is required to improve the reliability of BCI applications.

Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training. We show how simple changes in model parameters allow us to qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject. In the near future, this approach may provide a powerful computational to model individual skill learning and thus optimize and finely characterize BCI training.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The multimodal model has demonstrated promise in histopathology. However, most multimodal models are based on H\&E and genomics, adopting increasingly complex yet black-box designs. In our paper, we propose a novel interpretable multimodal framework named SHAP-CAT, which uses a Shapley-value-based dimension reduction technique for effective multimodal fusion. Starting with two paired modalities -- H\&E and IHC images, we employ virtual staining techniques to enhance limited input data by generating a new clinical-related modality. Lightweight bag-level representations are extracted from image modalities and a Shapley-value-based mechanism is used for dimension reduction. For each dimension of the bag-level representation, attribution values are calculated to indicate how changes in the specific dimensions of the input affect the model output. In this way, we select a few top important dimensions of bag-level representation for each image modality to late fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SHAP-CAT framework incorporating synthetic modalities significantly enhances model performance, yielding a 5\% increase in accuracy for the BCI, an 8\% increase for IHC4BC-ER, and an 11\% increase for the IHC4BC-PR dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visual brain decoding aims to decode visual information from human brain activities. Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.

For the improvement of interpretability, it is considered that sparse constraint on a factorized matrix is helpful. With this background, we construct a new ICA method with sparsity. In our method, the L1-regularization term is added to the cost function of ICA, and minimization of the cost function is performed by difference of convex functions algorithm. For the validity of our proposed method, we apply it to synthetic data and real functional magnetic resonance imaging data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Speech language models align with human brain responses to natural language to an impressive degree. However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting the neural response to natural images in the visual cortex requires extracting relevant features from the images and relating those feature to the observed responses. In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities on textual data. We explore whether these capabilities can be extended to continuous vectors from diverse domains, obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. By aligning input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors, we observe that LLMs can effectively process and learn from these projected vectors, which we term Vector-ICL. In particular, we find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. In our experiments across various tasks and modalities, including text reconstruction, numerical function regression, text classification, summarization, molecule captioning, time-series classification, graph classification, and fMRI decoding, Vector-ICL often surpasses both few-shot ICL and domain-specific model or tuning. We further conduct analyses and case studies, indicating the potential of LLMs to process vector representations beyond traditional token-based paradigms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities.</td>

However, fMRI datasets remain relatively small in scale, and the inherent issue of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in fMRI data further exacerbates these challenges. To address this, we apply compression techniques as a preprocessing step for fMRI data. We propose BrainCodec, a novel fMRI codec inspired by the neural audio codec. We evaluated BrainCodec's compression capability in mental state decoding, demonstrating further improvements over previous methods. Furthermore, we analyzed the latent representations obtained through BrainCodec, elucidating the similarities and differences between task and resting state fMRI, highlighting the interpretability of BrainCodec. Additionally, we demonstrated that fMRI reconstructions using BrainCodec can enhance the visibility of brain activity by achieving higher SNR, suggesting its potential as a novel denoising method. Our study shows that BrainCodec not only enhances performance over previous methods but also offers new analytical possibilities for neuroscience.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the morphology of galaxies is a critical aspect of astrophysics research, providing insight into the formation, evolution, and physical properties of these vast cosmic structures. Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\sim200$ for 2D images and $\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Abnormality detection in the identification of a single-subject which deviates from the majority of the dataset that comes from a control group is a critical problem. A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mobile edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence~(GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

This assessment enables us to identify domain-specific challenges and reveals that multimodal research in colonoscopy remains open for further exploration. To embrace the coming multimodal era, we establish three foundational initiatives: a large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset ColonINST, a colonoscopy-designed multimodal language model ColonGPT, and a multimodal benchmark.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Scaling up language models has significantly increased their capabilities. But larger models are slower models, and so there is now an extensive body of work (e.g., speculative sampling or parallel decoding) that improves the (average case) efficiency of language model generation. But these techniques introduce data-dependent timing characteristics. We show it is possible to exploit these timing differences to mount a timing attack. By monitoring the (encrypted) network traffic between a victim user and a remote language model, we can learn information about the content of messages by noting when responses are faster or slower. With complete black-box access, on open source systems we show how it is possible to learn the topic of a user's conversation (e.g., medical advice vs. coding assistance) with 90%+ precision, and on production systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude we can distinguish between specific messages or infer the user's language. We further show that an active adversary can leverage a boosting attack to recover PII placed in messages (e.g., phone numbers or credit card numbers) for open source systems. We conclude with potential defenses and directions for future work.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can lead to stroke and dementia. Stroke is the second leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasing by the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain imaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain atrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management and intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and dementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support radiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered commercially available software and research publications which identify at least two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13 research publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were available: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and ischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of patient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and longitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently analysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS were each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially available systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research systems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH and atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD markers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validated systems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive joint analysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB, and atrophy).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI studies employ chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) or spin lock (CESL) to study glucose uptake. Currently, these methods are hampered by low effect size and sensitivity to motion. To overcome this, we propose to utilize exchange-based linewidth (LW) broadening of the direct water saturation (DS) curve of the water saturation spectrum (Z-spectrum) during and after glucose infusion (DS-DGE MRI). Methods: To estimate the glucose-infusion-induced LW changes ($\Delta$LW), Bloch-McConnell simulations were performed for normoglycemia and hyperglycemia in blood, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), CSF, and malignant tumor tissue. Whole-brain DS-DGE imaging was implemented at 3 tesla using dynamic Z-spectral acquisitions (1.2 s per offset frequency, 38 s per spectrum) and assessed on four brain tumor patients using infusion of 35 g of D-glucose. To assess $\Delta$LW, a deep learning-based Lorentzian fitting approach was employed on voxel-based DS spectra acquired before, during, and post-infusion. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) images, obtained from the dynamic $\Delta$LW time curves, were compared qualitatively to perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). Results: In simulations, $\Delta$LW was 1.3%, 0.30%, 0.29/0.34%, 7.5%, and 13% in arterial blood, venous blood, GM/WM, malignant tumor tissue, and CSF, respectively. In vivo, $\Delta$LW was approximately 1% in GM/WM, 5-20% for different tumor types, and 40% in CSF. The resulting DS-DGE AUC maps clearly outlined lesion areas. Conclusions: DS-DGE MRI is highly promising for assessing D-glucose uptake. Initial results in brain tumor patients show high-quality AUC maps of glucose-induced line broadening and DGE-based lesion enhancement similar and/or complementary to PWI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sharing protected health information (PHI) is critical for furthering biomedical research. Before data can be distributed, practitioners often perform deidentification to remove any PHI contained in the text. Contemporary deidentification methods are evaluated on highly saturated datasets (tools achieve near-perfect accuracy) which may not reflect the full variability or complexity of real-world clinical text and annotating them is resource intensive, which is a barrier to real-world applications. To address this gap, we developed an adversarial approach using a large language model (LLM) to re-identify the patient corresponding to a redacted clinical note and evaluated the performance with a novel De-Identification/Re-Identification (DIRI) method. Our method uses a large language model to reidentify the patient corresponding to a redacted clinical note. We demonstrate our method on medical data from Weill Cornell Medicine anonymized with three deidentification tools: rule-based Philter and two deep-learning-based models, BiLSTM-CRF and ClinicalBERT. Although ClinicalBERT was the most effective, masking all identified PII, our tool still reidentified 9% of clinical notes Our study highlights significant weaknesses in current deidentification technologies while providing a tool for iterative development and improvement.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetism is widely used for the wireless localization and actuation of robots and devices for medical procedures. However, current static magnetic localization methods suffer from large required magnets and are limited to only five degrees of freedom due to a fundamental constraint of the rotational symmetry around the magnetic axis. We present the small-scale magneto-oscillatory localization (SMOL) method, which is capable of wirelessly localizing a millimeter-scale tracker with full six degrees of freedom in deep biological tissues. The SMOL device uses the temporal oscillation of a mechanically resonant cantilever with a magnetic dipole to break the rotational symmetry, and exploits the frequency-response to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio with sub-millimeter accuracy over a large distance of up to 12 centimeters and quasi-continuous refresh rates up to 200 Hz. Integration into real-time closed-loop controlled robots and minimally-invasive surgical tools are demonstrated to reveal the vast potential of the SMOL method.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In medical image visualization, path tracing of volumetric medical data like CT scans produces lifelike three-dimensional visualizations. Immersive VR displays can further enhance the understanding of complex anatomies. Going beyond the diagnostic quality of traditional 2D slices, they enable interactive 3D evaluation of anatomies, supporting medical education and planning. Rendering high-quality visualizations in real-time, however, is computationally intensive and impractical for compute-constrained devices like mobile headsets.   We propose a novel approach utilizing GS to create an efficient but static intermediate representation of CT scans. We introduce a layered GS representation, incrementally including different anatomical structures while minimizing overlap and extending the GS training to remove inactive Gaussians. We further compress the created model with clustering across layers.   Our approach achieves interactive frame rates while preserving anatomical structures, with quality adjustable to the target hardware. Compared to standard GS, our representation retains some of the explorative qualities initially enabled by immersive path tracing. Selective activation and clipping of layers are possible at rendering time, adding a degree of interactivity to otherwise static GS models. This could enable scenarios where high computational demands would otherwise prohibit using path-traced medical volumes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper demonstrates that spatial information can be used to learn interpretable representations in medical images using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our proposed method, ISImed, is based on the observation that medical images exhibit a much lower variability among different images compared to classic data vision benchmarks. By leveraging this resemblance of human body structures across multiple images, we establish a self-supervised objective that creates a latent representation capable of capturing its location in the physical realm. More specifically, our method involves sampling image crops and creating a distance matrix that compares the learned representation vectors of all possible combinations of these crops to the true distance between them. The intuition is, that the learned latent space is a positional encoding for a given image crop. We hypothesize, that by learning these positional encodings, comprehensive image representations have to be generated. To test this hypothesis and evaluate our method, we compare our learned representation with two state-of-the-art SSL benchmarking methods on two publicly available medical imaging datasets. We show that our method can efficiently learn representations that capture the underlying structure of the data and can be used to transfer to a downstream classification task.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Within this work, we introduce LIMIS: The first purely language-based interactive medical image segmentation model. We achieve this by adapting Grounded SAM to the medical domain and designing a language-based model interaction strategy that allows radiologists to incorporate their knowledge into the segmentation process. LIMIS produces high-quality initial segmentation masks by leveraging medical foundation models and allows users to adapt segmentation masks using only language, opening up interactive segmentation to scenarios where physicians require using their hands for other tasks. We evaluate LIMIS on three publicly available medical datasets in terms of performance and usability with experts from the medical domain confirming its high-quality segmentation masks and its interactive usability.</td>
