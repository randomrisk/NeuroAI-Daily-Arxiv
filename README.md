<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiral waves are ubiquitous signatures of non equilibrium dynamics, appearing across chemical, biological, and active systems. Yet, in many living systems these waves unfold on curved and folded surfaces whose geometry has rarely been treated as a dynamical factor. Here we show that surface curvature fundamentally shapes spiral wave behavior and can contribute to the organization of neural activity in the brain. Via analytical theory and simulations of the complex Ginzburg Landau equation (CGLE) on curved surfaces, we demonstrate that curvature enters through the Laplace Beltrami operator as a spatial modulation of effective diffusion. Gradients of this effective diffusion generate a geometric force on spiral defects, and the complex nature of the CGLE produces a complex mobility that leads to non central and non reciprocal responses. Applied to realistic cortical surfaces of the human brain, the model predicts that the pattern of cortical folding stabilizes and localizes spiral waves, while progressive smoothing of the surface erases these non equilibrium structures. This reveals that brain geometry is not a passive scaffold but an active physical constraint that shapes neural dynamics. More broadly, the same geometric mechanism provides a universal route by which curvature and topology control pattern formation across oscillatory, chemical, and active matter systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.   Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.   The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how neural activity gives rise to perception is a central challenge in neuroscience. We address the problem of decoding visual information from high-density intracortical recordings in primates, using the THINGS Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset. We systematically evaluate the effects of model architecture, training objectives, and data scaling on decoding performance. Results show that decoding accuracy is mainly driven by modeling temporal dynamics in neural signals, rather than architectural complexity. A simple model combining temporal attention with a shallow MLP achieves up to 70% top-1 image retrieval accuracy, outperforming linear baselines as well as recurrent and convolutional approaches. Scaling analyses reveal predictable diminishing returns with increasing input dimensionality and dataset size. Building on these findings, we design a modular generative decoding pipeline that combines low-resolution latent reconstruction with semantically conditioned diffusion, generating plausible images from 200 ms of brain activity. This framework provides principles for brain-computer interfaces and semantic neural decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</td>

Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how local neurophysiological patterns interact with global brain dynamics is essential for decoding human emotions from EEG signals. However, existing deep learning approaches often overlook the brain's intrinsic spatial organization, failing to simultaneously capture local topological relations and global dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Neuro-HGLN, a Neurologically-informed Hierarchical Graph-Transformer Learning Network that integrates biologically grounded priors with hierarchical representation learning. Neuro-HGLN first constructs a spatial Euclidean prior graph based on physical electrode distances to serve as an anatomically grounded inductive bias. A learnable global dynamic graph is then introduced to model functional connectivity across the entire brain. In parallel, to capture fine-grained regional dependencies, Neuro-HGLN builds region-level local graphs using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These graphs are processed synchronously through local-constrained parallel GCN layers to produce region-specific representations. Subsequently, an iTransformer encoder aggregates these features to capture cross-region dependencies under a dimension-as-token formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neuro-HGLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing enhanced interpretability grounded in neurophysiological structure. These results highlight the efficacy of unifying local topological learning with cross-region dependency modeling for robust EEG emotion recognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce a two-stage multitask learning framework for analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning. In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is challenged by pronounced inter-subject variability and the difficulty of learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical time series data, such as EEG and ECG, are vital for diagnosing neurological and cardiovascular diseases. However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF. CoDAC offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical time series diagnosis, effectively mitigating data scarcity challenges.</td>

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the gold standard for quantifying mental workload; however, due to its complexity and non-portability, it can be constraining. ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations. Overall, this work is an initiation for building low-cost, explainable, and real-time cognitive monitoring systems for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on ageing and clinical populations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Complex AI systems make better predictions but often lack transparency, limiting trustworthiness, interpretability, and safe deployment. Common post hoc AI explainers, such as LIME, SHAP, HSIC, and SAGE, are model agnostic but are too restricted in one significant regard: they tend to misrank correlated features and require costly perturbations, which do not scale to high dimensional data. We introduce ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a theoretically grounded, simple, and reliable metric for explaining the contribution of input features to model outputs, which remains stable and consistent under noise and sampling variations. We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient. To this end, we further extend ExCIR with an information theoretic foundation that unifies the correlation ratio with Canonical Correlation Analysis under mutual information bounds, enabling multi output and class conditioned explainability at scale.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant deployment challenges due to inter-subject variability, signal non-stationarity, and computational constraints. While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Passive brain-computer interfaces offer a potential source of implicit feedback for alignment of large language models, but most mental state decoding has been done in controlled tasks. This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.</td>

The device achieved 99.17% classification accuracy and 27.33 bits/min Information Transfer Rate (ITR), while consuming substantially less power than conventional desktop-based systems. The system integrates motion sensing to support artifact detection and improve robustness and signal stability in practical environments. For development and debugging, the system also provides optional TCP data streaming to external clients. Overall, EdgeSSVEP offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and secure embedded BCI platform suitable for assistive communication and neurofeedback applications, with potential extensions to accelerometer-based artifact mitigation and broader real-world deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current neural interfaces such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face several fundamental challenges, including frequent recalibration due to neuroplasticity and session-to-session variability, real-time processing latency, limited personalization and generalization across subjects, hardware constraints, surgical risks in invasive systems, and cognitive burden in patients with neurological impairments. These limitations significantly affect the accuracy, stability, and long-term usability of BCIs. This article introduces the concept of the Neural Digital Twin (NDT) as an advanced solution to overcome these barriers. NDT represents a dynamic, personalized computational model of the brain-BCI system that is continuously updated with real-time neural data, enabling prediction of brain states, optimization of control commands, and adaptive tuning of decoding algorithms. The design of NDT draws inspiration from the application of Digital Twin technology in advanced industries such as aerospace and autonomous vehicles, and leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience data acquisition technologies.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.   In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale neuroimaging studies often collect data from multiple scanners across different sites, where variations in scanners, scanning procedures, and other conditions across sites can introduce artificial site effects. These effects may bias brain connectivity measures, such as functional connectivity (FC), which quantify functional network organization derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). How to leverage high-dimensional network structures to effectively mitigate site effects has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we propose SLACC (Sparse LAtent Covariate-driven Connectome) factorization, a multivariate method that explicitly parameterizes covariate effects in latent subject scores corresponding to sparse rank-1 latent patterns derived from brain connectivity. The proposed method identifies localized site-driven variability within and across brain networks, enabling targeted correction. We develop a penalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, incorporating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to guide optimization. Extensive simulations validate SLACC's robustness in recovering the true parameters and underlying connectivity patterns. Applied to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, SLACC demonstrates its ability to reduce site effects. The R package to implement our method is publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.   We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a data-driven framework to characterize large-scale brain dynamical states directly from correlation matrices at the single-subject level. By treating correlation thresholding as a percolation-like probe of connectivity, the approach tracks multiple cluster- and network-level observables and identifies a characteristic percolation threshold, rc, at which these signatures converge. We use $r_c$ as an operational and physically interpretable descriptor of large-scale brain dynamical state. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 996), the method yields stable, subject-specific estimates that covary systematically with established dynamical indicators such as temporal autocorrelations. Numerical simulations of a whole-brain model with a known critical regime further show that $r_c$ tracks changes in collective dynamics under controlled variations of excitability. By replacing arbitrary threshold selection with a criterion intrinsic to correlation structure, the r-spectra provides a physically grounded approach for comparing brain dynamical states across individuals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding neural responses to visual stimuli remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of brain representations and the modality gap between neural data and visual inputs. Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate fMRI analysis requires sensitivity to temporal structure across multiple scales, as BOLD signals encode cognitive processes that emerge from fast transient dynamics to slower, large-scale fluctuations. Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes. Experiments on clinical and non-clinical datasets demonstrate that NeuroSSM achieves competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art fMRI analysis methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an indirect measurement of neuronal activity via hemodynamic responses that vary across brain regions and individuals. Ignoring this hemodynamic variability can bias downstream connectivity estimates. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters themselves may serve as important imaging biomarkers. Estimating spatially varying hemodynamics from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is therefore an important but challenging blind inverse problem, since both the latent neural activity and the hemodynamic coupling are unknown. In this work, we propose a methodology for inferring hemodynamic coupling on the cortical surface from rsfMRI. Our approach avoids the highly unstable joint recovery of neural activity and hemodynamics by marginalizing out the latent neural signal and basing inference on the resulting marginal likelihood. To enable scalable, high-resolution estimation, we employ a deep neural network combined with conditional normalizing flows to accurately approximate this intractable marginal likelihood, while enforcing spatial coherence through priors defined on the cortical surface that admit sparse representations. The proposed approach is extensively validated using synthetic data and real fMRI datasets, demonstrating clear improvements over current methods for hemodynamic estimation and downstream connectivity analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) are rapidly evolving toward wearable, multimodal, and data-driven, AI-supported neuroimaging in the everyday world. However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a Standard Model (SM) extension where neutrinos get masses through a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism. This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(μ\to e γ)\simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $μ\to eee$ and $μ$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach. Altogether, the radiative origin of neutrino masses links low-energy flavor observables to collider signatures, delineating discovery targets for MEG II, Mu2e/COMET, and the HL-LHC and distinguishing this framework from conventional inverse- and radiative-seesaw models. Moreover, the $Z_3$ guarantees a stable DM candidate, either scalar ($ρ$) or fermionic ($Ω$). Then, here we analyze and identify the viable parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic abundance for both situations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain dynamics dominate every level of neural organization -- from single-neuron spiking to the macroscopic waves captured by fMRI, MEG, and EEG -- yet the mathematical tools used to interrogate those dynamics remain scattered across a patchwork of traditions. Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail. Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery.</td>

In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical entities and are poised to transform personalized medicine through the real-time simulation and prediction of human physiology. Translating this paradigm from engineering to biomedicine requires overcoming profound challenges, including anatomical variability, multi-scale biological processes, and the integration of multi-physics phenomena. This survey systematically reviews methodologies for building digital twins of human organs, structured around a pipeline decoupled into anatomical twinning (capturing patient-specific geometry and structure) and functional twinning (simulating multi-scale physiology from cellular to organ-level function). We categorize approaches both by organ-specific properties and by technical paradigm, with particular emphasis on multi-scale and multi-physics integration. A key focus is the role of artificial intelligence (AI), especially physics-informed AI, in enhancing model fidelity, scalability, and personalization. Furthermore, we discuss the critical challenges of clinical validation and translational pathways. This study not only charts a roadmap for overcoming current bottlenecks in single-organ twins but also outlines the promising, albeit ambitious, future of interconnected multi-organ digital twins for whole-body precision healthcare.</td>

BioTune enhances transfer learning by optimally choosing which layers to freeze and adjusting learning rates for unfrozen layers. Through extensive evaluation on nine image classification datasets, spanning natural and specialized domains such as medical imaging, BioTune demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, including AutoRGN and LoRA, highlighting its adaptability to various data characteristics and distribution changes. Additionally, BioTune consistently achieves top performance across four different CNN architectures, underscoring its flexibility.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The need for semiconductor technology for crystalline silicon of the highest purity and homogeneity has provided samples exhibiting low optical absorption in the infrared range. Such silicon has become the basis for photonic elements in the telecommunication band, including high-Q microresonators, which are particularly important. However, at longer wavelengths, the loss mechanisms have not yet been sufficiently studied. At the same time, this range is extremely important, especially for biological and medical applications and for fundamental research. We used optical microresonators with whispering gallery modes made from various types of silicon crystals as a tool to study the loss mechanisms. The study involved the pump wavelengths 1.5, 2.6, 6.1, and 8.6 $μ$m and the maximum measured Q-factors were $1.5\cdot10^9$, $5\cdot10^8$, $1.6\cdot10^7$, and $5\cdot10^4$, respectively. We showed that the conductivity type does not noticeably influence the optical losses, while resistivity and the growing method are defining factors. Our study confirms the utility of WGM microresonators as loss measurement tools and provides significant potential for the development of silicon microresonator-based photonics in the mid-IR band.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) adapted via contrastive learning excel in general representation learning but struggle in vertical domains like chemistry and law, primarily due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.</td>

In this study, we constructed a visual question answering (VQA) dataset from structured data in an open dataset and investigated an image-finding generation method for chest CT images, with the aim of enabling interactive diagnostic support that presents findings based on questions that reflect physicians' interests rather than fixed descriptions. In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Methods for generating image findings in response to these questions have also been investigated. Based on the generated results and evaluation metric scores, the proposed method was effective as an interactive diagnostic support system that can present image findings according to physicians' interests.</td>
