<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce the spiked mixture model (SMM) to address the problem of estimating a set of signals from many randomly scaled and noisy observations. Subsequently, we design a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to recover all parameters of the SMM. Numerical experiments show that in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, and for data types where the SMM is relevant, SMM surpasses the more traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in terms of signal recovery performance. The broad relevance of the SMM and its corresponding EM recovery algorithm is demonstrated by applying the technique to different data types. The first case study is a biomedical research application, utilizing an imaging mass spectrometry dataset to explore the molecular content of a rat brain tissue section at micrometer scale. The second case study demonstrates SMM performance in a computer vision application, segmenting a hyperspectral imaging dataset into underlying patterns. While the measurement modalities differ substantially, in both case studies SMM is shown to recover signals that were missed by traditional methods such as k-means clustering and GMM.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hemispheric strokes impair motor control in contralateral body parts, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies. Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current methods for searching brain MR images rely on text-based approaches, highlighting a significant need for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain age is the estimate of biological age derived from neuroimaging datasets using machine learning algorithms. Increasing \textit{brain age gap} characterized by an elevated brain age relative to the chronological age can reflect increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Hence, brain age gap is a promising biomarker for monitoring brain health. However, black-box machine learning approaches to brain age gap prediction have limited practical utility. Recent studies on coVariance neural networks (VNN) have proposed a relatively transparent deep learning pipeline for neuroimaging data analyses, which possesses two key features: (i) inherent \textit{anatomically interpretablity} of derived biomarkers; and (ii) a methodologically interpretable perspective based on \textit{linkage with eigenvectors of anatomic covariance matrix}. In this paper, we apply the VNN-based approach to study brain age gap using cortical thickness features for various prevalent neurodegenerative conditions. Our results reveal distinct anatomic patterns for brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distinct anatomic patterns of brain age gap are linked with the differences in how VNN leverages the eigenspectrum of the anatomic covariance matrix, thus lending explainability to the reported results.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning.   In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-risking condition characterized by bleeding within the brain parenchyma. ICU readmission in ICH patients is a critical outcome, reflecting both clinical severity and resource utilization. Accurate prediction of ICU readmission risk is crucial for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing healthcare resources. This study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) databases, which contain comprehensive clinical and demographic data on ICU patients. Patients with ICH were identified from both databases. Various clinical, laboratory, and demographic features were extracted for analysis based on both overview literature and experts' opinions. Preprocessing methods like imputing and sampling were applied to improve the performance of our models. Machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost, and Random Forest, were employed to develop predictive models for ICU readmission risk. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The developed models demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for ICU readmission in ICH patients, with key predictors including demographic information, clinical parameters, and laboratory measurements. Our study provides a predictive framework for ICU readmission risk in ICH patients, which can aid in clinical decision-making and improve resource allocation in intensive care settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis. Cases of long-range dependencies are also presented to further illustrate the effectiveness of ALTER. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/yushuowiki/ALTER}.</td>

More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotional information is essential for enhancing human-computer interaction and deepening image understanding. However, while deep learning has advanced image recognition, the intuitive understanding and precise control of emotional expression in images remain challenging. Similarly, music research largely focuses on theoretical aspects, with limited exploration of its emotional dimensions and their integration with visual arts. To address these gaps, we introduce EmoMV, an emotion-driven music-to-visual manipulation method that manipulates images based on musical emotions. EmoMV combines bottom-up processing of music elements-such as pitch and rhythm-with top-down application of these emotions to visual aspects like color and lighting. We evaluate EmoMV using a multi-scale framework that includes image quality metrics, aesthetic assessments, and EEG measurements to capture real-time emotional responses. Our results demonstrate that EmoMV effectively translates music's emotional content into visually compelling images, advancing multimodal emotional integration and opening new avenues for creative industries and interactive technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The recent rapid development of auditory attention decoding (AAD) offers the possibility of using electroencephalography (EEG) as auxiliary information for target speaker extraction. However, effectively modeling long sequences of speech and resolving the identity of the target speaker from EEG signals remains a major challenge. In this paper, an improved feature extraction network (IFENet) is proposed for neuro-oriented target speaker extraction, which mainly consists of a speech encoder with dual-path Mamba and an EEG encoder with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). We propose SpeechBiMamba, which makes use of dual-path Mamba in modeling local and global speech sequences to extract speech features. In addition, we propose EEGKAN to effectively extract EEG features that are closely related to the auditory stimuli and locate the target speaker through the subject's attention information. Experiments on the KUL and AVED datasets show that IFENet outperforms the state-of-the-art model, achieving 36\% and 29\% relative improvements in terms of scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) under an open evaluation condition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, there is an increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate aspects of the research process, or even autonomously conduct the full research cycle from idea generation, over data analysis, to composing and evaluation of scientific manuscripts. Examples of working AI scientist systems have been demonstrated for computer science tasks and running molecular biology labs. While some approaches aim for full autonomy of the scientific AI, others rather aim for leveraging human-AI teaming. Here, we address how to adapt such approaches for boosting Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development, as well as brain research resp. neuroscience at large. We argue that at this time, a strong emphasis on human-AI teaming, in contrast to fully autonomous AI BCI researcher will be the most promising way forward. We introduce the collaborative workspaces concept for human-AI teaming based on a set of Janusian design principles, looking both ways, to the human as well as to the AI side. Based on these principles, we present ChatBCI, a Python-based toolbox for enabling human-AI collaboration based on interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for BCI research and development projects. We show how ChatBCI was successfully used in a concrete BCI project on advancing motor imagery decoding from EEG signals. Our approach can be straightforwardly extended to broad neurotechnological and neuroscientific topics, and may by design facilitate human expert knowledge transfer to scientific AI systems in general.</td>

This Brain-Computer Interface utilizes scalp potential data from (electroencephalography) EEG electrodes on a subject's head to decode specific letters or arbitrary targets the subject is looking at on a screen. However, deep neural networks for SSVEP spellers often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen subjects, largely due to the high variability in EEG data. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach combining data augmentation and language modeling to enhance the performance of SSVEP spellers. Using the Benchmark dataset from Tsinghua University, we explore various data augmentation techniques, including frequency masking, time masking, and noise injection, to improve the robustness of deep learning models. Additionally, we integrate a language model (CharRNN) with EEGNet to incorporate linguistic context, significantly enhancing word-level decoding accuracy. Our results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 2.9 percent over the baseline, with time masking and language modeling showing the most promise. This work paves the way for more accurate and generalizable SSVEP speller systems, offering improved communication solutions for individuals with disabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Meta-learning, i.e., "learning to learn", is a promising approach to enable efficient BCI classifier training with limited amounts of data. It can effectively use collections of in some way similar classification tasks, with rapid adaptation to new tasks where only minimal data are available. However, applying meta-learning to existing classifiers and BCI tasks requires significant effort. To address this issue, we propose EEG-Reptile, an automated library that leverages meta-learning to improve classification accuracy of neural networks in BCIs and other EEG-based applications. It utilizes the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to adapt neural network classifiers of EEG data to the inter-subject domain, allowing for more efficient fine-tuning for a new subject on a small amount of data. The proposed library incorporates an automated hyperparameter tuning module, a data management pipeline, and an implementation of the Reptile meta-learning algorithm. EEG-Reptile automation level allows using it without deep understanding of meta-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEG-Reptile on two benchmark datasets (BCI IV 2a, Lee2019 MI) and three neural network architectures (EEGNet, FBCNet, EEG-Inception). Our library achieved improvement in both zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios compared to traditional transfer learning approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Air-writing is a challenging task that combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, offering an intuitive and natural approach for human-computer interaction. However, current air-writing solutions face two primary challenges: (1) their dependency on complex sensors (e.g., Radar, EEGs and others) for capturing precise handwritten trajectories, and (2) the absence of a video-based air-writing dataset that covers a comprehensive vocabulary range. These limitations impede their practicality in various real-world scenarios, including the use on devices like iPhones and laptops. To tackle these challenges, we present the groundbreaking air-writing Chinese character video dataset (AWCV-100K-UCAS2024), serving as a pioneering benchmark for video-based air-writing. This dataset captures handwritten trajectories in various real-world scenarios using commonly accessible RGB cameras, eliminating the need for complex sensors. AWCV-100K-UCAS2024 includes 8.8 million video frames, encompassing the complete set of 3,755 characters from the GB2312-80 level-1 set (GB1). Furthermore, we introduce our baseline approach, the video-based character recognizer (VCRec). VCRec adeptly extracts fingertip features from sparse visual cues and employs a spatio-temporal sequence module for analysis. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of VCRec compared to existing models in recognizing air-written characters, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This breakthrough paves the way for enhanced human-computer interaction in real-world contexts. Moreover, our approach leverages affordable RGB cameras, enabling its applicability in a diverse range of scenarios. The code and data examples will be made public at https://github.com/wmeiqi/AWCV.</td>

The aim of this paper is to enhance teaching quality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the classroom activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing machine learning algorithms, this study proposes a comprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables, enabling the effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based on specific parameters. However, the real-time impact of machine learning models necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level of students' comprehension with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface was introduced that accesses the values of the system's parameters to determine a student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the proposed system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by the students, consider the system's cost, and establish trust in its efficacy. This paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue through the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework for addressing key considerations for future research directions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>People exhibit unique emotional responses. In the same scenario, the emotional reactions of two individuals can be either similar or vastly different. For instance, consider one person's reaction to an invitation to smoke versus another person's response to a query about their sleep quality. The identification of these individual traits through the observation of common physical parameters opens the door to a wide range of applications, including psychological analysis, criminology, disease prediction, addiction control, and more. While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics, inertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a novel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected from 80 participants using a portable EEG headset. We also conduct a statistical analysis of the collected data utilizing box plots. Our analysis uncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach for identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques on EEG data. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we explore two deep-learning models to compare the performance of our solution. Consequently, we have developed an integrated, real-time trait identification solution using EEG data, based on the insights from our analysis. To validate our approach, we conducted a rigorous user evaluation with an additional 20 participants. The outcomes of this evaluation illustrate both high accuracy and favorable user ratings, emphasizing the robust potential of our proposed method to serve as a versatile solution for human trait identification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vection, the visual illusion of self-motion, provides a strong marker of the VR user experience and plays an important role in both presence and cybersickness. Traditional measurements have been conducted using questionnaires, which exhibit inherent limitations due to their subjective nature and preventing real-time adjustments. Detecting vection in real time would allow VR systems to adapt to users' needs, improving comfort and minimizing negative effects like motion sickness. This paper investigates the presence of vection markers in electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals using evoked potentials (brain responses to external stimulations).   We designed a VR experiment that induces vection using two conditions: (1) forward acceleration or (2) backward acceleration. We recorded both electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and gathered subjective reports on thirty (30) participants. We found an evoked potential of vection characterized by a positive peak around 600 ms (P600) after stimulus onset in the parietal region and a simultaneous negative peak in the frontal region. Our results also found participant variability in sensitivity to vection and cybersickness and EEG markers of acceleration across subjects. This result is promising for potential detection of vection using EEG and paves the way for future studies towards a better understanding of vection. It also provides insights into the functional role of the visual system and its integration with the vestibular system during motion-perception. It has the potential to help enhance VR user experience by qualifying users' perceived vection and adapting the VR environments accordingly.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hemispheric strokes impair motor control in contralateral body parts, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies. Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, there is an increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate aspects of the research process, or even autonomously conduct the full research cycle from idea generation, over data analysis, to composing and evaluation of scientific manuscripts. Examples of working AI scientist systems have been demonstrated for computer science tasks and running molecular biology labs. While some approaches aim for full autonomy of the scientific AI, others rather aim for leveraging human-AI teaming. Here, we address how to adapt such approaches for boosting Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development, as well as brain research resp. neuroscience at large. We argue that at this time, a strong emphasis on human-AI teaming, in contrast to fully autonomous AI BCI researcher will be the most promising way forward. We introduce the collaborative workspaces concept for human-AI teaming based on a set of Janusian design principles, looking both ways, to the human as well as to the AI side. Based on these principles, we present ChatBCI, a Python-based toolbox for enabling human-AI collaboration based on interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for BCI research and development projects. We show how ChatBCI was successfully used in a concrete BCI project on advancing motor imagery decoding from EEG signals. Our approach can be straightforwardly extended to broad neurotechnological and neuroscientific topics, and may by design facilitate human expert knowledge transfer to scientific AI systems in general.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct interaction between the brain and external devices. To concurrently achieve high decoding accuracy and low energy consumption in invasive BCIs, we propose a novel spiking neural network (SNN) framework incorporating local synaptic stabilization (LSS) and channel-wise attention (CA), termed LSS-CA-SNN. LSS optimizes neuronal membrane potential dynamics, boosting classification performance, while CA refines neuronal activation, effectively reducing energy consumption. Furthermore, we introduce SpikeDrop, a data augmentation strategy designed to expand the training dataset thus enhancing model generalizability. Experiments on invasive spiking datasets recorded from two rhesus macaques demonstrated that LSS-CA-SNN surpassed state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) in both decoding accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving 0.80-3.87% performance gains and 14.78-43.86 times energy saving. This study highlights the potential of LSS-CA-SNN and SpikeDrop in advancing invasive BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) spellers are a promising communication tool for individuals with disabilities. This Brain-Computer Interface utilizes scalp potential data from (electroencephalography) EEG electrodes on a subject's head to decode specific letters or arbitrary targets the subject is looking at on a screen. However, deep neural networks for SSVEP spellers often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen subjects, largely due to the high variability in EEG data. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach combining data augmentation and language modeling to enhance the performance of SSVEP spellers. Using the Benchmark dataset from Tsinghua University, we explore various data augmentation techniques, including frequency masking, time masking, and noise injection, to improve the robustness of deep learning models. Additionally, we integrate a language model (CharRNN) with EEGNet to incorporate linguistic context, significantly enhancing word-level decoding accuracy. Our results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 2.9 percent over the baseline, with time masking and language modeling showing the most promise. This work paves the way for more accurate and generalizable SSVEP speller systems, offering improved communication solutions for individuals with disabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Meta-learning, i.e., "learning to learn", is a promising approach to enable efficient BCI classifier training with limited amounts of data. It can effectively use collections of in some way similar classification tasks, with rapid adaptation to new tasks where only minimal data are available. However, applying meta-learning to existing classifiers and BCI tasks requires significant effort. To address this issue, we propose EEG-Reptile, an automated library that leverages meta-learning to improve classification accuracy of neural networks in BCIs and other EEG-based applications. It utilizes the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to adapt neural network classifiers of EEG data to the inter-subject domain, allowing for more efficient fine-tuning for a new subject on a small amount of data. The proposed library incorporates an automated hyperparameter tuning module, a data management pipeline, and an implementation of the Reptile meta-learning algorithm. EEG-Reptile automation level allows using it without deep understanding of meta-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEG-Reptile on two benchmark datasets (BCI IV 2a, Lee2019 MI) and three neural network architectures (EEGNet, FBCNet, EEG-Inception). Our library achieved improvement in both zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios compared to traditional transfer learning approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) help people with severe speech and motor disabilities communicate and interact with their environment using neural activity. This work focuses on the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm of BCIs using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). The RSVP typing task is a recursive task with multiple sequences, where users see only a subset of symbols in each sequence. Extensive research has been conducted to improve classification in the RSVP typing task, achieving fast classification. However, these methods struggle to achieve high accuracy and do not consider the typing mechanism in the learning procedure. They apply binary target and non-target classification without including recursive training. To improve performance in the classification of symbols while controlling the classification speed, we incorporate the typing setup into training by proposing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the RSVP typing task as a POMDP for recursive classification. Experiments show that the proposed approach, MarkovType, results in a more accurate typing system compared to competitors. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that while there is a trade-off between accuracy and speed, MarkovType achieves the optimal balance between these factors compared to other methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent studies have demonstrated that the representations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can exhibit notable similarities to cortical representations when subjected to identical auditory sensory inputs. In these studies, the ability to predict cortical representations is probed by regressing from ANN representations to cortical representations. Building upon this concept, our approach reverses the direction of prediction: we utilize ANN representations as a supervisory signal to train recognition models using noisy brain recordings obtained through non-invasive measurements. Specifically, we focus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where electroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening serve as input. By training an EEG recognition model to predict ANN representations-representations associated with music identification-we observed a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach to developing recognition models for brain recordings in response to external auditory stimuli. It holds promise for advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCI), neural decoding techniques, and our understanding of music cognition. Furthermore, it provides new insights into the relationship between auditory brain activity and ANN representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from immersive, high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations enhances ecological validity and allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios based on individual cognitive states. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into inter-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. EEG data were collected from 52 non-pilot participants conducting flight tasks in an aircraft simulation, after which they reported cognitive workload using the NASA Task Load Index. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload using two feature sets extracted from the EEG data: 1) spectral features (Baseline model), and 2) a combination of spectral and connectivity features (Connectivity model), both within the alpha, beta, and theta band ranges. Results showed that the performance of the Connectivity model surpassed the Baseline model. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) provided insights into the most influential workload-predicting features, highlighting the potential dominance of parietal-directed connectivity in managing cognitive workload during simulated flight. Further research on other connectivity metrics and alternative models (such as deep learning) in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the possibility of a real-time BCI for the prediction of workload under safety-critical operational conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a computer. It has been widely used in medical diagnosis, rehabilitation, education, entertainment, etc. Most research so far focuses on making BCIs more accurate and reliable, but much less attention has been paid to their privacy. Developing a commercial BCI system usually requires close collaborations among multiple organizations, e.g., hospitals, universities, and/or companies. Input data in BCIs, e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG), contain rich privacy information, and the developed machine learning model is usually proprietary. Data and model transmission among different parties may incur significant privacy threats, and hence privacy protection in BCIs must be considered. Unfortunately, there does not exist any contemporary and comprehensive review on privacy-preserving BCIs. This paper fills this gap, by describing potential privacy threats and protection strategies in BCIs. It also points out several challenges and future research directions in developing privacy-preserving BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The quantitative formulation of evolution equations is the backbone for prediction, control, and understanding of dynamical systems across diverse scientific fields. Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding aims to reconstruct original stimuli from fMRI signals, providing insights into interpreting mental content. Current approaches rely heavily on subject-specific models due to the complex brain processing mechanisms and the variations in fMRI signals across individuals. Therefore, these methods greatly limit the generalization of models and fail to capture cross-subject commonalities. To address this, we present UniBrain, a unified brain decoding model that requires no subject-specific parameters. Our approach includes a group-based extractor to handle variable fMRI signal lengths, a mutual assistance embedder to capture cross-subject commonalities, and a bilevel feature alignment scheme for extracting subject-invariant features. We validate our UniBrain on the brain decoding benchmark, achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art subject-specific models with extremely fewer parameters. We also propose a generalization benchmark to encourage the community to emphasize cross-subject commonalities for more general brain decoding.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This Dissertation is comprised of two main projects, addressing questions in neuroscience through applications of generative modeling.   Project #1 (Chapter 4) explores how neurons encode features of the external world. I combine Helmholtz's "Perception as Unconscious Inference" -- paralleled by modern generative models like variational autoencoders (VAE) -- with the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. This combination leads to the development of a hierarchical VAE model, which I test for its ability to mimic neurons from the primate visual cortex in response to motion stimuli. Results show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate brain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion inputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner. Collectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding.   Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using simultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates that the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with around half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities. Comparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from fMRI and Ca2+ signals.   The introduction (Chapter 1) is divided similarly to this abstract: sections 1.1 to 1.8 provide background information about Project #1, and sections 1.9 to 1.13 are related to Project #2. Chapter 2 includes historical background, Chapter 3 provides the necessary mathematical background, and finally, Chapter 6 contains concluding remarks and future directions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) is commonly employed to study human brain activity, since it offers insight into the relationship between functional fluctuations and human behavior. To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders, with significant impacts on many daily activities and quality of life. It stands as one of the most common mental disorders globally and ranks as the second leading cause of disability. The current diagnostic approach for MDD primarily relies on clinical observations and patient-reported symptoms, overlooking the diverse underlying causes and pathophysiological factors contributing to depression. Therefore, scientific researchers and clinicians must gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MDD. There is growing evidence in neuroscience that depression is a brain network disorder, and the use of neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a significant role in identifying and treating MDD. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques used to study MDD. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to neuroimaging data to help with early mental health disorder detection. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in graph neural networks (GNNs), which are deep neural architectures specifically designed to handle graph-structured data like rs-fMRI. This research aimed to develop an ensemble-based GNN model capable of detecting discriminative features from rs-fMRI images for the purpose of diagnosing MDD. Specifically, we constructed an ensemble model by combining features from multiple brain region segmentation atlases to capture brain complexity and detect distinct features more accurately than single atlas-based models. Further, the effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by assessing its performance on a large multi-site MDD dataset. The best performing model among all folds achieved an accuracy of 75.80%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 61.84%, a precision of 71.29%, and an F1-score of 79.12%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing that centers around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks. Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that play significant roles in determining ESN performance.</td>

One application of fMRI is investigating potential neural features that distinguish people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from healthy controls. The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) facilitates this research through its extensive data-sharing initiative. While ABIDE offers data preprocessed with various atlases, independent component analysis (ICA) for dimensionality reduction remains underutilized. We address this gap by presenting ICA-based resting-state networks (RSNs) from preprocessed scans from ABIDE, now publicly available: https://github.com/SjirSchielen/groupICAonABIDE. These RSNs unveil neural activation clusters without atlas constraints, offering a perspective on ASD analyses that complements the predominantly atlas-based literature. This contribution provides a valuable resource for further research into ASD, potentially aiding in developing new analytical approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\% to 54.88\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning has recently enabled the decoding of language from the neural activity of a few participants with electrodes implanted inside their brain. However, reliably decoding words from non-invasive recordings remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language.</td>

MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions.</td>

The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target.

No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone cancer, often requires accurate necrosis assessment from whole slide images (WSIs) for effective treatment planning and prognosis. However, manual assessments are subjective and prone to variability. In response, we introduce FDDM, a novel framework bridging the gap between patch classification and region-based segmentation. FDDM operates in two stages: patch-based classification, followed by region-based refinement, enabling cross-patch information intergation. Leveraging a newly curated dataset of osteosarcoma images, FDDM demonstrates superior segmentation performance, achieving up to a 10% improvement mIOU and a 32.12% enhancement in necrosis rate estimation over state-of-the-art methods. This framework sets a new benchmark in osteosarcoma assessment, highlighting the potential of foundation models and diffusion-based refinements in complex medical imaging tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Exploring the functions of genes and gene products is crucial to a wide range of fields, including medical research, evolutionary biology, and environmental science. However, discovering new functions largely relies on expensive and exhaustive wet lab experiments. Existing methods of automatic function annotation or prediction mainly focus on protein function prediction with sequence, 3D-structures or protein family information. In this study, we propose to tackle the gene function prediction problem by exploring Gene Ontology graph and annotation with BERT (GoBERT) to decipher the underlying relationships among gene functions. Our proposed novel function prediction task utilizes existing functions as inputs and generalizes the function prediction to gene and gene products. Specifically, two pre-train tasks are designed to jointly train GoBERT to capture both explicit and implicit relations of functions. Neighborhood prediction is a self-supervised multi-label classification task that captures the explicit function relations. Specified masking and recovering task helps GoBERT in finding implicit patterns among functions. The pre-trained GoBERT possess the ability to predict novel functions for various gene and gene products based on known functional annotations. Extensive experiments, biological case studies, and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GoBERT.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cancer remains a significant health challenge worldwide, with a new diagnosis occurring every two minutes in the UK. Surgery is one of the main treatment options for cancer. However, surgeons rely on the sense of touch and naked eye with limited use of pre-operative image data to directly guide the excision of cancerous tissues and metastases due to the lack of reliable intraoperative visualisation tools. This leads to increased costs and harm to the patient where the cancer is removed with positive margins, or where other critical structures are unintentionally impacted. There is therefore a pressing need for more reliable and accurate intraoperative visualisation tools for minimally invasive surgery to improve surgical outcomes and enhance patient care.   A recent miniaturised cancer detection probe (i.e., SENSEI developed by Lightpoint Medical Ltd.) leverages the cancer-targeting ability of nuclear agents to more accurately identify cancer intra-operatively using the emitted gamma signal. However, the use of this probe presents a visualisation challenge as the probe is non-imaging and is air-gapped from the tissue, making it challenging for the surgeon to locate the probe-sensing area on the tissue surface. Geometrically, the sensing area is defined as the intersection point between the gamma probe axis and the tissue surface in 3D space but projected onto the 2D laparoscopic image. Hence, in this thesis, tool tracking, pose estimation, and segmentation tools were developed first, followed by laparoscope image depth estimation algorithms and 3D reconstruction methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate depth estimation is crucial for many fields, including robotics, navigation, and medical imaging. However, conventional depth sensors often produce low-resolution (LR) depth maps, making detailed scene perception challenging. To address this, enhancing LR depth maps to high-resolution (HR) ones has become essential, guided by HR-structured inputs like RGB or grayscale images. We propose a novel sensor fusion methodology for guided depth super-resolution (GDSR), a technique that combines LR depth maps with HR images to estimate detailed HR depth maps. Our key contribution is the Incremental guided attention fusion (IGAF) module, which effectively learns to fuse features from RGB images and LR depth maps, producing accurate HR depth maps. Using IGAF, we build a robust super-resolution model and evaluate it on multiple benchmark datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results compared to all baseline models on the NYU v2 dataset for $\times 4$, $\times 8$, and $\times 16$ upsampling. It also outperforms all baselines in a zero-shot setting on the Middlebury, Lu, and RGB-D-D datasets. Code, environments, and models are available on GitHub.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Weakly-supervised medical image segmentation is gaining traction as it requires only rough annotations rather than accurate pixel-to-pixel labels, thereby reducing the workload for specialists. Although some progress has been made, there is still a considerable performance gap between the label-efficient methods and fully-supervised one, which can be attributed to the uncertainty nature of these weak labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel weak annotation method coupled with its learning framework EAUWSeg to eliminate the annotation uncertainty. Specifically, we first propose the Bounded Polygon Annotation (BPAnno) by simply labeling two polygons for a lesion. Then, the tailored learning mechanism that explicitly treat bounded polygons as two separated annotations is proposed to learn invariant feature by providing adversarial supervision signal for model training. Subsequently, a confidence-auxiliary consistency learner incorporates with a classification-guided confidence generator is designed to provide reliable supervision signal for pixels in uncertain region by leveraging the feature presentation consistency across pixels within the same category as well as class-specific information encapsulated in bounded polygons annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that EAUWSeg outperforms existing weakly-supervised segmentation methods. Furthermore, compared to fully-supervised counterparts, the proposed method not only delivers superior performance but also costs much less annotation workload. This underscores the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current methods for searching brain MR images rely on text-based approaches, highlighting a significant need for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The ISCHEMIA Trial randomly assigned patients with ischemic heart disease to an invasive treatment strategy centered on revascularization with a control group assigned non-invasive medical therapy. As is common in such ``strategy trials,'' many participants assigned to treatment remained untreated while many assigned to control crossed over into treatment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of strategy trials preserve randomization-based comparisons, but ITT effects are diluted by non-compliance. Conventional per-protocol analyses that condition on treatment received are likely biased by discarding random assignment. In trials where compliance choices are made shortly after assignment, instrumental variables (IV) methods solve both problems -- recovering an undiluted average causal effect of treatment for treated subjects who comply with trial protocol. In ISCHEMIA, however, some controls were revascularized as long as five years after random assignment. This paper extends the IV framework for strategy trials, allowing for such dynamic non-random compliance behavior. IV estimates of long-run revascularization effects on quality of life are markedly larger than previously reported ITT and per-protocol estimates. We also show how to estimate complier characteristics in a dynamic-treatment setting. These estimates reveal increasing selection bias in naive time-varying per-protocol estimates of revascularization effects. Compliers have baseline health similar to that of the study population, while control-group crossovers are far sicker.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image segmentation demands the aggregation of global and local feature representations, posing a challenge for current methodologies in handling both long-range and short-range feature interactions. Recently, vision mamba (ViM) models have emerged as promising solutions for addressing model complexities by excelling in long-range feature iterations with linear complexity. However, existing ViM approaches overlook the importance of preserving short-range local dependencies by directly flattening spatial tokens and are constrained by fixed scanning patterns that limit the capture of dynamic spatial context information. To address these challenges, we introduce a simple yet effective method named context clustering ViM (CCViM), which incorporates a context clustering module within the existing ViM models to segment image tokens into distinct windows for adaptable local clustering. Our method effectively combines long-range and short-range feature interactions, thereby enhancing spatial contextual representations for medical image segmentation tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations on diverse public datasets, i.e., Kumar, CPM17, ISIC17, ISIC18, and Synapse demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hypergraph data, which capture multi-way interactions among entities, are becoming increasingly prevalent in the big data eta. Generating new hyperlinks from an observed, usually high-dimensional hypergraph is an important yet challenging task with diverse applications, such as electronic health record analysis and biological research. This task is fraught with several challenges. The discrete nature of hyperlinks renders many existing generative models inapplicable. Additionally, powerful machine learning-based generative models often operate as black boxes, providing limited interpretability. Key structural characteristics of hypergraphs, including node degree heterogeneity and hyperlink sparsity, further complicate the modeling process and must be carefully addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose Denoising Diffused Embeddings (DDE), a general generative model architecture for hypergraphs. DDE exploits potential low-rank structures in high-dimensional hypergraphs and adopts the state-of-the-art diffusion model framework. Theoretically, we show that when true embeddings are accessible, DDE exactly reduces the task of generating new high-dimensional hyperlinks to generating new low-dimensional embeddings. Moreover, we analyze the implications of using estimated embeddings in DDE, revealing how hypergraph properties--such as dimensionality, node degree heterogeneity, and hyperlink sparsity--impact its generative performance. Simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of DDE over existing methods, in terms of both computational efficiency and generative accuracy. Furthermore, an application to a symptom co-occurrence hypergraph derived from electronic medical records uncovers interesting findings and highlights the advantages of DDE.</td>
