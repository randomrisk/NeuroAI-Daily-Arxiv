<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain adopts the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals to reduce the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we consider the task of distinguishing a non-Gaussian signal by LPC from $(N-1)$ Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of statistical mechanics, and formulate a thermodynamic free energy to implement the tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. We demonstrate that energy--information tradeoff may induce a discontinuous phase transition of the optimal matrix, from a very weak one with $S \approx 0$ to a functional LPC system with moderate synaptic weights in which a single unit responds selectively to the input non-Gaussian feature with high signal-to-noise ratio.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.   The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.   This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised deep learning has accelerated 2D natural image analysis but remains difficult to translate into 3D MRI, where data are scarce and pre-trained 2D backbones cannot capture volumetric context. We present a sequence-invariant self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. This yields a robust 3D encoder that performs strongly across varied tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). Our model also generalises effectively to unseen sites, demonstrating potential for more scalable and clinically reliable volumetric analysis. All code and trained models are publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the modeling of a variety of models of large-scale systems of interacting agents, mathematical models consider that the coupling terms representing the interactions between agents are scaled according to the network size to prevent divergence of the coupling terms. In a previous paper of ours and follow-ups from colleagues, we have explored the behavior of a large-scale system of interacting agents with diffusive coupling. It was shown that the system converges to a Dirac mass, that is free to evolve according to the intrinsic dynamics. We generalize these results to more general coupling functions, and show that, under specific conditions, the divergence of the coupling term does not preclude the well-posedness of limit equations. Instead, the system carries solutions associated to a balanced, so that the net input where leading order, vanishes. We also explore convergence to the balanced state. Such balanced regimes were widely observed in neuroscience and associated with complex regulatory mechanisms. This results offer an alternative, minimalistic perspective on the balance of excitation/inhibition in the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Anomaly detection from images captured using camera sensors is one of the mainstream applications at the industrial level. Particularly, it maintains the quality and optimizes the efficiency in production processes across diverse industrial tasks, including advanced manufacturing and aerospace engineering. Traditional anomaly detection workflow is based on a manual inspection by human operators, which is a tedious task. Advances in intelligent automated inspection systems have revolutionized the Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) process. Recent vision-based approaches can automatically extract, process, and interpret features using computer vision and align with the goals of automation in industrial operations. In light of the shift in inspection methodologies, this survey reviews studies published since 2019, with a specific focus on vision-based anomaly detection. The components of an IAD pipeline that are overlooked in existing surveys are presented, including areas related to data acquisition, preprocessing, learning mechanisms, and evaluation. In addition to the collected publications, several scientific and industry-related challenges and their perspective solutions are highlighted. Popular and relevant industrial datasets are also summarized, providing further insight into inspection applications. Finally, future directions of vision-based IAD are discussed, offering researchers insight into the state-of-the-art of industrial inspection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The evolution of cognition is frequently discussed as the evolution of cognitive abilities or the evolution of some neuronal structures in the brain. However, since such traits or abilities are often highly complex, understanding their evolution requires explaining how they could have gradually evolved through selection acting on heritable variations in simpler cognitive mechanisms. With this in mind, making use of a previously proposed theory, here we show how the evolution of cognitive abilities can be captured by the fine-tuning of basic learning mechanisms and, in particular, chunking mechanisms. We use the term chunking broadly for all types of non-elemental learning, claiming that the process by which elements are combined into chunks and associated with other chunks, or elements, is critical for what the brain can do, and that it must be fine-tuned to ecological conditions. We discuss the relevance of this approach to studies in animal cognition, using examples from animal foraging and decision-making, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility. Finally, we explain how even the apparent human-animal gap in sequence learning ability can be explained in terms of different fine-tunings of a similar chunking process.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate and efficient segmentation of brain tumors is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring in clinical practice. In this study, we present an enhanced ResUNet architecture for automatic brain tumor segmentation, integrating an EfficientNetB0 encoder, a channel attention mechanism, and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. The EfficientNetB0 encoder leverages pre-trained features to improve feature extraction efficiency, while the channel attention mechanism enhances the model's focus on tumor-relevant features. ASPP enables multiscale contextual learning, crucial for handling tumors of varying sizes and shapes. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: TCGA LGG and BraTS 2020. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline ResUNet and its EfficientNet variant, achieving Dice coefficients of 0.903 and 0.851 and HD95 scores of 9.43 and 3.54 for whole tumor and tumor core regions on the BraTS 2020 dataset, respectively. compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach shows competitive performance, particularly in whole tumor and tumor core segmentation. These results indicate that combining a powerful encoder with attention mechanisms and ASPP can significantly enhance brain tumor segmentation performance. The proposed approach holds promise for further optimization and application in other medical image segmentation tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper proposes two new distance measures, called functional Ward's linkages, for functional data clustering that are robust against outliers. Conventional Ward's linkage defines the distance between two clusters as the increase in sum of squared errors (SSE) upon merging, which can be interpreted graphically as an increase in the diameter. Analogously, functional Ward's linkage defines the distance of two clusters as the increased width of the band delimited by the merged clusters. To address the limitations of conventional Ward's linkage in handling outliers and contamination, the proposed linkages focus exclusively on the most central curves by leveraging magnitude-shape outlyingness measures and modified band depth, respectively. Simulations and real-world electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform other competitive approaches, particularly in the presence of various types of outliers and contamination.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a crucial tool for studying brain activity. Recently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets have emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available annotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the following limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in the hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private datasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of Brain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG foundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a per-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial correlations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required compared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging from 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of publicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations, our models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks, with competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction. This validates our models' effectiveness and effictiveness.</td>

Individuals with epilepsy often face significant employment challenges due to safety concerns in certain work environments.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising modality for biometric identification. While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Polysomnographic sleep analysis is the standard clinical method to accurately diagnose and treat sleep disorders. It is an intricate process which involves the manual identification, classification, and location of multiple sleep event patterns. This is complex, for which identification of different types of events involves focusing on different subsets of signals, resulting on an iterative time-consuming process entailing several visual analysis passes. In this paper we propose a multi-task deep-learning approach for the simultaneous detection of sleep events and hypnogram construction in one single pass. Taking as reference state-of-the-art methodology for object-detection in the field of Computer Vision, we reformulate the problem for the analysis of multi-variate time sequences, and more specifically for pattern detection in the sleep analysis scenario. We investigate the performance of the resulting method in identifying different assembly combinations of EEG arousals, respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) and sleep stages, also considering different input signal montage configurations. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach using two independent datasets, assessing true-generalization effects involving local and external validation scenarios. Based on our results, we analyze and discuss our method's capabilities and its potential wide-range applicability across different settings and datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing speech envelopes from EEG signals is essential for exploring neural mechanisms underlying speech perception. Yet, EEG variability across subjects and physiological artifacts complicate accurate reconstruction. To address this problem, we introduce Subject Disentangling Neural Network (SDN-Net), which disentangles subject identity information from reconstructed speech envelopes to enhance cross-subject reconstruction accuracy. SDN-Net integrates three key components: MLA-Codec, MPN-MI, and CTA-MTDNN. The MLA-Codec, a fully convolutional neural network, decodes EEG signals into speech envelopes. The CTA-MTDNN module, a multi-scale time-delay neural network with channel and temporal attention, extracts subject identity features from EEG signals. Lastly, the MPN-MI module, a mutual information estimator with a multi-layer perceptron, supervises the removal of subject identity information from the reconstructed speech envelope. Experiments on the Auditory EEG Decoding Dataset demonstrate that SDN-Net achieves superior performance in inner- and cross-subject speech envelope reconstruction compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews.</td>

XR enhances ecological validity while enabling real-time, multimodal data collection through tools such as galvanic skin response (GSR), electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), hand tracking, and body tracking. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive and emotional processes, as well as adaptive, personalized interventions for users. Despite these advancements, current XR applications often underutilize the full potential of multimodal integration, relying primarily on visual and auditory inputs. Challenges such as cybersickness, usability concerns, and accessibility barriers further limit the widespread adoption of XR tools in cognitive science and clinical practice. This review examines XR-based cognitive assessment and training, focusing on its advantages over traditional methods, including ecological validity, engagement, and adaptability. It also explores unresolved challenges such as system usability, cost, and the need for multimodal feedback integration.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The development of EEG decoding algorithms confronts challenges such as data sparsity, subject variability, and the need for precise annotations, all of which are vital for advancing brain-computer interfaces and enhancing the diagnosis of diseases. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage approach named Self-Supervised State Reconstruction-Primed Riemannian Dynamics (EEG-ReMinD) , which mitigates reliance on supervised learning and integrates inherent geometric features. This approach efficiently handles EEG data corruptions and reduces the dependency on labels. EEG-ReMinD utilizes self-supervised and geometric learning techniques, along with an attention mechanism, to analyze the temporal dynamics of EEG features within the framework of Riemannian geometry, referred to as Riemannian dynamics. Comparative analyses on both intact and corrupted datasets from two different neurodegenerative disorders underscore the enhanced performance of EEG-ReMinD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The audio visual benefit in speech perception, where congruent visual input enhances auditory processing, is well documented across age groups, particularly in challenging listening conditions and among individuals with varying hearing abilities. However, most studies rely on highly controlled laboratory environments with scripted stimuli. Here, we examine the audio visual benefit using unscripted, natural speech from untrained speakers within a virtual acoustic environment. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and cortical speech tracking, we assessed neural responses across audio visual, audio only, visual only, and masked lip conditions to isolate the role of lip movements. Additionally, we analysed individual differences in acoustic and visual features of the speakers, including pitch, jitter, and lip openness, to explore their influence on the audio visual speech tracking benefit. Results showed a significant audio visual enhancement in speech tracking with background noise, with the masked lip condition performing similarly to the audio-only condition, emphasizing the importance of lip movements in adverse listening situations. Our findings reveal the feasibility of cortical speech tracking with naturalistic stimuli and underscore the impact of individual speaker characteristics on audio-visual integration in real world listening contexts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising modality for biometric identification. While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The decoding of continuously spoken speech from neuronal activity has the potential to become an important clinical solution for paralyzed patients. Deep Learning Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have recently successfully mapped neuronal activity to text contents in subjects who attempted to formulate speech. However, only small BCI datasets are available. In contrast, labeled data and pre-trained models for the closely related task of speech recognition from audio are widely available. One such model is Wav2Vec2 which has been trained in a self-supervised fashion to create meaningful representations of speech audio data. In this study, we show that patterns learned by Wav2Vec2 are transferable to brain data. Specifically, we replace its audio feature extractor with an untrained Brain Feature Extractor (BFE) model. We then execute full fine-tuning with pre-trained weights for Wav2Vec2, training ''from scratch'' without pre-trained weights as well as freezing a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 and training only the BFE each for 45 different BFE architectures. Across these experiments, the best run is from full fine-tuning with pre-trained weights, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 18.54\%, outperforming the best training from scratch run by 20.46\% and that of frozen Wav2Vec2 training by 15.92\% percentage points. These results indicate that knowledge transfer from audio speech recognition to brain decoding is possible and significantly improves brain decoding performance for the same architectures.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews.</td>

This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question "what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain--computer interfaces are groundbreaking technology whereby brain signals are used to control external devices. Despite some advances in recent years, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor-imagery tasks face challenges, such as amplitude and phase variability and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller models and faster inference. In this study, we develop a prototype, called the Lightweight Geometric Learning Brain--Computer Interface (LGL-BCI), which uses our customized geometric deep learning architecture for swift model inference without sacrificing accuracy. LGL-BCI contains an EEG channel selection module via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a symmetric positive definite matrix, providing adaptiveness among the continuously changing EEG signal. Meanwhile, a built-in lossless transformation helps boost the inference speed. The performance of our solution was evaluated using two real-world EEG devices and two public EEG datasets. LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency. These findings underscore both the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of LGL-BCI, demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of geometric deep learning in motor-imagery brain--computer interface applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor execution, a fundamental aspect of human behavior, has been extensively studied using BCI technologies. EEG and fNIRS have been utilized to provide valuable insights, but their individual limitations have hindered performance. This study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying rest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI dataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a multimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional Additive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging convolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in multimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a computationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a hybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from separate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate that MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities (EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than EEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with embedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and OD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data. This work highlights the potential of deep learning, specifically MECASA, to enhance EEG-fNIRS fusion for BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer numerous human-centered application possibilities, particularly affecting people with neurological disorders. Text or speech decoding from brain activities is a relevant domain that could augment the quality of life for people with impaired speech perception. We propose a novel approach to enhance listened speech decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by utilizing an auxiliary phoneme predictor that simultaneously decodes textual phoneme sequences. The proposed model architecture consists of three main parts: EEG module, speech module, and phoneme predictor. The EEG module learns to properly represent EEG signals into EEG embeddings. The speech module generates speech waveforms from the EEG embeddings. The phoneme predictor outputs the decoded phoneme sequences in text modality. Our proposed approach allows users to obtain decoded listened speech from EEG signals in both modalities (speech waveforms and textual phoneme sequences) simultaneously, eliminating the need for a concatenated sequential pipeline for each modality. The proposed approach also outperforms previous methods in both modalities. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding speech from non-invasive brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), has the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), with applications in silent communication and assistive technologies for individuals with speech impairments. However, EEG-based speech decoding faces major challenges, such as noisy data, limited datasets, and poor performance on complex tasks like speech perception. This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) facilitate high-throughput target image detection by identifying event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked in EEG signals. The RSVP-BCI systems effectively detect single-class targets within a stream of images but have limited applicability in scenarios that require detecting multiple target categories. Multi-class RSVP-BCI systems address this limitation by simultaneously identifying the presence of a target and distinguishing its category. However, existing multi-class RSVP decoding algorithms predominantly rely on single-modality EEG decoding, which restricts their performance improvement due to the high similarity between ERPs evoked by different target categories. In this work, we introduce eye movement (EM) modality into multi-class RSVP decoding and explore EEG and EM fusion to enhance decoding performance. First, we design three independent multi-class target RSVP tasks and build an open-source dataset comprising EEG and EM signals from 43 subjects. Then, we propose the Multi-class Target RSVP EEG and EM fusion Network (MTREE-Net) to enhance multi-class RSVP decoding. Specifically, a dual-complementary module is proposed to strengthen the differentiation of uni-modal features across categories. To improve multi-modal fusion performance, we adopt a dynamic reweighting fusion strategy guided by theoretically derived modality contribution ratios. Furthermore, we reduce the misclassification of non-target samples through knowledge transfer between two hierarchical classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of integrating EM signals into multi-class RSVP decoding and highlight the superior performance of MTREE-Net compared to existing RSVP decoding methods. The proposed MTREE-Net and open-source dataset provide a promising framework for developing practical multi-class RSVP-BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.   The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.   This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Biological networks, such as the brain, are known to exhibit group structure at a variety of scales -- local, meso, and global scale. Modularity, while useful in describing mesoscale brain organization, is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure. This approach, while valuable, overlooks important localized variations in community structure at the node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity ($nQ$) captures both meso and local scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that $nQ$ illuminates granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored $nQ$ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. Observed changes in $nQ$ in fMRI and DTI networks aligned with known trajectories of AD and were linked to common biomarkers of the disease, including amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Additionally, $nQ$ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters showing indications that $nQ$ may be a useful diagnostic tool for characterizing disease stages. Our findings demonstrate the utility of $nQ$ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into temporal and disease related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, $nQ$ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</td>

By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty along with ridge regularization, GCKAN infers the Granger causality from time series while enabling automatic time lag selection. Additionally, we propose an algorithm leveraging time-reversed Granger causality to enhance inference accuracy. The algorithm compares prediction and sparse-inducing losses derived from the original and time-reversed series, automatically selecting the casual relationship with the higher score or integrating the results to mitigate spurious connectivities.

In this paper, we present the first investigation of introducing optimal stochastic tracking control strategy to synchronize the dynamics of the brain network to a target dynamics rather than to a target state at a specific time point. We utilized fMRI data from healthy groups, and cases of stroke and post-stroke aphasia. For all participants, we utilized a gradient descent optimization method to estimate the parameters for the brain network dynamic system. We then utilized optimal stochastic tracking control techniques to drive original unhealthy dynamics by controlling a certain number of nodes to synchronize with target healthy dynamics. Results show that the energy associated with optimal stochastic tracking control is negatively correlated with the intrinsic average controllability of the brain network system, while the energy of the optimal state approaching control is significantly related to the target state value. For a 100-dimensional brain network system, controlling the five nodes with the lowest tracking energy can achieve relatively acceptable dynamics control effects. Our results suggest that stochastic tracking control is more aligned with the objective of brain stimulation interventions, and is closely related to the intrinsic characteristics of the brain network system, potentially representing a new direction for future brain network optimal control research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Complex systems are characterized by nonlinear dynamics, multi-level interactions, and emergent collective behaviors. Traditional analyses that focus solely on pairwise interactions often oversimplify these systems, neglecting the higher-order interactions critical for understanding their full collective dynamics. Recent advances in multivariate information theory provide a principled framework for quantifying these higher-order interactions, capturing key properties such as redundancy, synergy, shared randomness, and collective constraints. However, two major challenges persist: accurately estimating joint entropies and addressing the combinatorial explosion of interacting terms. To overcome these challenges, we introduce THOI (Torch-based High-Order Interactions), a novel, accessible, and efficient Python library for computing high-order interactions in continuous-valued systems. THOI leverages the well-established Gaussian copula method for joint entropy estimation, combined with state-of-the-art batch and parallel processing techniques to optimize performance across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments. Our results demonstrate that THOI significantly outperforms existing tools in terms of speed and scalability. For larger systems, where exhaustive analysis is computationally impractical, THOI integrates optimization strategies that make higher-order interaction analysis feasible. We validate THOI accuracy using synthetic datasets with parametrically controlled interactions and further illustrate its utility by analyzing fMRI data from human subjects in wakeful resting states and under deep anesthesia. Finally, we analyzed over 900 real-world and synthetic datasets, establishing a comprehensive framework for applying higher-order interaction (HOI) analysis in complex systems.</td>

The works on the NSD dataset, with stimuli images from the COCO dataset, leverage the embeddings from the CLIP model for image reconstruction and GIT for captioning. However, the current captioning approach introduces the challenge of potential data contamination given that the GIT model was trained on the COCO dataset. In this work, we present an alternative method for decoding brain signals into image captions by predicting a DINOv2 model's embedding of an image from the corresponding fMRI signal and then providing its [CLS] token as the prefix to the GPT-2 language model which decreases computational requirements considerably. Additionally, instead of commonly used Linear Regression, we explore 3D Convolutional Neural Network mapping of fMRI signals to image embedding space for better accounting positional information of voxels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The quantitative formulation of evolution equations is the backbone for prediction, control, and understanding of dynamical systems across diverse scientific fields. Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lepton flavor violation (LFV) offers a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in models addressing neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate LFV processes within the framework of type II seesaw leptogenesis, where the Standard Model is extended by an $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs field. We focus on key LFV processes including $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$, $\mu^+ \to e^+e^-e^+$, and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion in nuclei, deriving stringent constraints on the parameter space from current experimental data. We scan the 3$\sigma$ range of neutrino oscillation parameters and identify the most conservative bounds consistent with existing measurements. Our results reveal that the MEG experiment currently provides the strongest constraints in the normal ordering (NO) scenario, while the SINDRUM experiment offers comparable sensitivity in the inverted ordering (IO) case. Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e, and COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing larger regions of the parameter space. This work underscores the crucial role of LFV experiments in probing type II seesaw leptogenesis, providing an avenue to explore the connections between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and inflation at experimentally accessible energy scales.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques in multi-view settings face significant challenges, particularly when integrating heterogeneous data, aligning feature spaces, and managing view-specific biases. These issues are prominent in neuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are analyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), where signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's underlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are assumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View Independent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across subjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual variability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a temporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory stimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays alone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to differ across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a model with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in closed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms existing multi-view ICA methods. We further validate its effectiveness using the Cam-CAN dataset, and showing how delays and dilations are related to aging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The resting-state brain networks (RSNs) reflects the functional connectivity patterns between brain modules, providing essential foundations for decoding intrinsic neural information within the brain. It serves as one of the primary tools for describing the spatial dynamics of the brain using various neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the distribution rules or potential modes of functional connectivity weights in the resting state remain unclear. In this context, we first start from simulation, using forward solving model to generate scalp EEG with four channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128). Subsequently, we construct scalp brain networks using five coupling measures, aiming to explore whether different channel density or coupling measures affect the distribution pattern of functional connectivity weights. Next, we quantify the distribution pattern by calculating the skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy of the functional connectivity network weights. Finally, the results of the simulation were validated in a normative database. We observed that: 1) The functional connection weights exhibit a right-skewed distribution, and are not influenced by channel density or coupling measures; 2) The functional connection weights exhibit a relatively uniform distribution, with the potential for volume conduction to affect the degree of uniformity in the distribution; 3) Networks constructed using coupling measures influenced by volume conduction exhibit significant correlations between the average connection weight and measures of skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of RSNs, providing valuable insights for research in the field of neuroscience, and holds promise for being associated with brain cognition and disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent experimental results from the Atomki collaboration have reported the observation of anomalous effects in Beryllium, Helium and Carbon nuclear transitions that could hint at physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the MEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the Beryllium transition ${^8}\text{Be}^\star\to{^8}\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of this result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations of the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$ with mass around $17\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of a spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was initially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous signal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the SINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon anomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A Magnetoencephalography (MEG) time-series recording consists of multi-channel signals collected by superconducting sensors, with each signal's intensity reflecting magnetic field changes over time at the sensor location. Automating epileptic MEG spike detection significantly reduces manual assessment time and effort, yielding substantial clinical benefits. Existing research addresses MEG spike detection by encoding neural network inputs with signals from all channel within a time segment, followed by classification. However, these methods overlook simultaneous spiking occurred from nearby sensors. We introduce a simple yet effective paradigm that first clusters MEG channels based on their sensor's spatial position. Next, a novel convolutional input module is designed to integrate the spatial clustering and temporal changes of the signals. This module is fed into a custom MEEG-ResNet3D developed by the authors, which learns to extract relevant features and classify the input as a spike clip or not. Our method achieves an F1 score of 94.73% on a large real-world MEG dataset Sanbo-CMR collected from two centers, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 1.85%. Moreover, it demonstrates efficacy and stability in the Electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure detection task, yielding an improved weighted F1 score of 1.4% compared to current state-of-the-art techniques evaluated on TUSZ, whch is the largest EEG seizure dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Radiology plays a pivotal role in modern medicine due to its non-invasive diagnostic capabilities. However, the manual generation of unstructured medical reports is time consuming and prone to errors. It creates a significant bottleneck in clinical workflows. Despite advancements in AI-generated radiology reports, challenges remain in achieving detailed and accurate report generation. In this study we have evaluated different combinations of multimodal models that integrate Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate comprehensive radiology reports. We employed a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) and a SWIN Transformer as the image encoders. The BART and GPT-2 models serve as the textual decoders. We used Chest X-ray images and reports from the IU-Xray dataset to evaluate the usability of the SWIN Transformer-BART, SWIN Transformer-GPT-2, ViT-B16-BART and ViT-B16-GPT-2 models for report generation. We aimed at finding the best combination among the models. The SWIN-BART model performs as the best-performing model among the four models achieving remarkable results in almost all the evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU and BERTScore.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

By leveraging prior probability distributions from DMs, we enhance the joint reconstruction and motion estimation process, improving image quality and preserving resolution. Experiments on extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, yielding artifact-free, high-resolution reconstructions even under irregular breathing conditions. These results showcase the potential of combining DMs with motion correction to advance sparse-view 4DCT imaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>X-ray imaging is the most widely used medical imaging modality. However, in the common practice, inconsistency in the initial presentation of X-ray images is a common complaint by radiologists. Different patient positions, patient habitus and scanning protocols can lead to differences in image presentations, e.g., differences in brightness and contrast globally or regionally. To compensate for this, additional work will be executed by clinical experts to adjust the images to the desired presentation, which can be time-consuming. Existing deep-learning-based end-to-end solutions can automatically correct images with promising performances. Nevertheless, these methods are hard to be interpreted and difficult to be understood by clinical experts. In this manuscript, a novel interpretable mapping method by deep learning is proposed, which automatically enhances the image brightness and contrast globally and locally. Meanwhile, because the model is inspired by the workflow of the brightness and contrast manipulation, it can provide interpretable pixel maps for explaining the motivation of image enhancement. The experiment on the clinical datasets show the proposed method can provide consistent brightness and contrast correction on X-ray images with accuracy of 24.75 dB PSNR and 0.8431 SSIM.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Confidence in the results is a key ingredient to improve the adoption of machine learning methods by clinicians. Uncertainties on the results have been considered in the literature, but mostly those originating from the learning and processing methods. Uncertainty on the data is hardly challenged, as a single sample is often considered representative enough of each subject included in the analysis. In this paper, we propose a representation learning strategy to estimate local uncertainties on a physiological descriptor (here, myocardial deformation) previously obtained from medical images by different definitions or computations. We first use manifold alignment to match the latent representations associated to different high-dimensional input descriptors. Then, we formulate plausible distributions of latent uncertainties, and finally exploit them to reconstruct uncertainties on the input high-dimensional descriptors. We demonstrate its relevance for the quantification of myocardial deformation (strain) from 3D echocardiographic image sequences of the right ventricle, for which a lack of consensus exists in its definition and which directional component to use. We used a database of 100 control subjects with right ventricle overload, for which different types of strain are available at each point of the right ventricle endocardial surface mesh. Our approach quantifies local uncertainties on myocardial deformation from different descriptors defining this physiological concept. Such uncertainties cannot be directly estimated by local statistics on such descriptors, potentially of heterogeneous types. Beyond this controlled illustrative application, our methodology has the potential to be generalized to many other population analyses considering heterogeneous high-dimensional descriptors.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical language models (MLMs) have become pivotal in advancing medical natural language processing. However, prior models that rely on pre-training or supervised fine-tuning often exhibit low data efficiency and limited practicality in real-world clinical applications. While OpenAIs O1 highlights test-time scaling in mathematics, attempts to replicate this approach in medicine typically distill responses from GPT-series models to open-source models, focusing primarily on multiple-choice tasks. This strategy, though straightforward, neglects critical concerns like data privacy and realistic deployment in clinical settings. In this work, we present a deployable, small-scale medical language model, \mone, designed for long-chain reasoning in clinical tasks using a self-evolution paradigm. Starting with a seed dataset of around 8,000 instances spanning five domains and 16 datasets, we prompt a base policy model to perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct verifiable reasoning chains. Each reasoning step is assigned an evolution rollout value, allowing verified trajectories to train the policy model and the reward model. During inference, the policy model generates multiple responses, and the reward model selects the one with the highest reward score. Experiments on eleven evaluation datasets demonstrate that \mone outperforms prior open-source models by 2 points, with the addition of the reward model further boosting performance ($\sim$13 points), surpassing GPT-4o-mini.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this study, we present the Physical-Bio Translator, an agent-based simulation model designed to simulate cellular responses following irradiation. This simulation framework is based on a novel cell-state transition model that accurately reflects the characteristics of irradiated cells. To validate the Physical-Bio Translator, we performed simulations of cell phase evolution, cell phenotype evolution, and cell survival. The results indicate that the Physical-Bio Translator effectively replicates experimental cell irradiation outcomes, suggesting that digital cell irradiation experiments can be conducted via computer simulation, offering a more sophisticated model for radiation biology. This work lays the foundation for developing a robust and versatile digital twin at multicellular or tissue scales, aiming to comprehensively study and predict patient responses to radiation therapy.</td>
