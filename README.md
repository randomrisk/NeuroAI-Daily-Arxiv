<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding behavior, such as movement, from multiscale brain networks remains a central objective in neuroscience. Over the past decades, artificial intelligence and machine learning have played an increasingly significant role in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying motor function. The advancement of brain-monitoring technologies, capable of capturing complex neuronal signals with high spatial and temporal resolution, necessitates the development and application of more sophisticated machine learning models for behavioral decoding. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning framework, an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM model, to decode skilled and complex forelimb movements using signals obtained from in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Our findings demonstrate that the intricate movements of both ipsilateral and contralateral forelimbs can be accurately decoded from unilateral M1 neuronal ensembles. These results highlight the efficacy of advanced hybrid deep learning models in capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies of neuronal networks activity linked to complex movement execution.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate dose calculation is crucial in radiotherapy, as tissue relative electron densities (RED) derived from CT scans play a vital role. This study investigated the impact of different CT-to-RED calibration curves on brain cancer treatment plans. Three calibration curves were compared: CIRS phantom-derived, Catphan phantom-derived, and the default curve in the Monaco Treatment Planning System. Ten volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated and recalculated using each curve. Dosimetric parameters for Planning Target Volume (PTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) were analyzed. Results showed significant differences in PTV dose distribution between the CIRS-derived and default curves, while no significant differences were found between Catphan-derived and default curves. The CIRS-derived curve demonstrated superior performance in representing brain tissue electron densities. These findings emphasize the importance of using site-specific CT-to-RED calibration curves for accurate dose calculations in brain radiotherapy, potentially improving treatment safety and efficacy</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional insights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics. Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: A growing number of cancer patients with brain metastases can benefit from stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) thanks to recent advances in systemic therapies. With an increasing patient load, single-isocenter treatments on widely available C-arm linear accelerators are an attractive option. However, the planning of such treatments is challenging for multi-target cases due to the island blocking problem, which occurs when the multi-leaf collimator cannot conform to all targets simultaneously.   Purpose: We propose a multi-target partitioning algorithm that mitigates excessive exposure of normal tissue caused by the island blocking problem.   Methods: The algorithm divides (partitions) the set of targets into subsets to treat with separate arc passes, optimizing both subsets and collimator angles to minimize island blocking. The algorithm was incorporated into a fully automated treatment planning script and evaluated on 20 simulated patient cases, each with 10 brain metastases and 21 Gy prescriptions. It was also retrospectively evaluated on six clinical cases.   Results: Partitioning significantly improved the gradient index, global efficiency index, and brain V12Gy compared to simultaneous treatment of all metastases. For example, the average gradient index improved from 5.9 to 3.3, global efficiency index from 0.32 to 0.46, and normal brain V12Gy from 49 cm3 to 26 cm3 between 3 and 9 arcs. The proposed algorithm outperformed baselines in utilizing a limited number of arcs. All target partitioning strategies increased the total number of monitor units (MUs).   Conclusions: The dose gradient in single-isocenter VMAT plans can be substantially improved by treating a smaller subset of metastases at a time. This requires more MUs and arcs, implying a trade-off between delivery time and plan quality which can be explored using the algorithm proposed in this paper.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.</td>

An RL agent adjusted haptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural decoder. Results show that the RL agent's performance was comparable across feedback sources, suggesting that implicit neural feedback can effectively guide personalization without requiring active user input. The EEG-based neural decoder achieved a mean F1 score of 0.8, supporting reliable classification of user experience.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) are a pressing global public health issue, impacting tens of millions of individuals annually. Vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians, are vastly overrepresented in the worldwide TBI statistics. To evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention measures, researchers often employ Finite Element (FE) models of the human body to virtually simulate the human response to impact in real-world road traffic accident scenarios. However, VRU accidents occur in a highly uncontrolled environment and, in consequence, there is a large amount of variables (covariates), e.g. the vehicle impact speed and VRU body posture, that together dictate the injurious outcome of the collision. At the same time, since FE analysis is a computationally heavy task, researchers often need to apply extensive simplifications to FE models when attempting to predict real-world VRU head trauma. To help researchers make informed decisions when conducting FE accident reconstructions, this literature review aims to create an overarching summary of covariates that have been reported influential in literature. The review provides researchers with an overview of variables proven to have an influence on head injury predictions. The material could potentially be useful as a basis for choosing parameters to include when performing sensitivity analyses of car-to-pedestrian impact simulations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate and reproducible brain morphometry from structural MRI is critical for monitoring neuroanatomical changes across time and across imaging domains. Although deep learning has accelerated segmentation workflows, scanner-induced variability and reproducibility limitations remain-especially in longitudinal and multi-site settings. In this study, we benchmark two modern segmentation pipelines, FastSurfer and SynthSeg, both integrated into FreeSurfer, one of the most widely adopted tools in neuroimaging.   Using two complementary datasets - a 17-year longitudinal cohort (SIMON) and a 9-site test-retest cohort (SRPBS)-we quantify inter-scan segmentation variability using Dice coefficient, Surface Dice, Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our results reveal up to 7-8% volume variation in small subcortical structures such as the amygdala and ventral diencephalon, even under controlled test-retest conditions. This raises a key question: is it feasible to detect subtle longitudinal changes on the order of 5-10% in pea-sized brain regions, given the magnitude of domain-induced morphometric noise?   We further analyze the effects of registration templates and interpolation modes, and propose surface-based quality filtering to improve segmentation reliability. This study provides a reproducible benchmark for morphometric reproducibility and emphasizes the need for harmonization strategies in real-world neuroimaging studies.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper studies subtypes of restricted, repetitive and stereotypical behaviors (RRBs) in adolescent males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the viewpoint of the dynamics of brain functional connectivities (FCs). Data from the ABIDE-II repository and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) metrics are used to form two ASD groups with tightly controlled demographics; one comprises subjects with scores above threshold for the self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) subscale, and the other subjects with scores below threshold for SIBs, but above threshold for at least one of the other subscales (stereotyped, compulsive, ritualistic, insistence on sameness, restricted interests). The dynamics of the coherence for FCs across distinct frequency bands are compared against matched controls, using a novel volatility measure computed in time-frequency space. We find statistically significant differences, on average, in the volatility of a relatively small set of FCs, most mapping to either the default mode network or the cerebellum, in the mid- and high-frequency bands, and yielding higher volatility in subjects with high levels of SIBs. Results suggest a distinct underlying profile for SIBs involving multiple brain regions associated with rewards and emotions processing. The work contributes to the identification of neural substrates potentially underlying behavioral subtypes, and may help target interventions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is crucial for diagnosing mental health conditions but is costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to augment datasets for machine learning applications. However, generating high-quality synthetic EEG that preserves emotional and mental health signals remains challenging. This study proposes a method combining correlation analysis and random sampling to generate realistic synthetic EEG data.   We first analyze interdependencies between EEG frequency bands using correlation analysis. Guided by this structure, we generate synthetic samples via random sampling. Samples with high correlation to real data are retained and evaluated through distribution analysis and classification tasks. A Random Forest model trained to distinguish synthetic from real EEG performs at chance level, indicating high fidelity.   The generated synthetic data closely match the statistical and structural properties of the original EEG, with similar correlation coefficients and no significant differences in PERMANOVA tests. This method provides a scalable, privacy-preserving approach for augmenting EEG datasets, enabling more efficient model training in mental health research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This project addresses the need for efficient, real-time analysis of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) for continuous health monitoring. Traditional methods rely on long-duration data recording followed by offline analysis, which is power-intensive and delays responses to critical symptoms such as arrhythmia. To overcome these limitations, a time-domain ECG analysis model based on a novel dynamically-biased Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) neural network is proposed. This model supports simultaneous ECG forecasting and classification with high performance-achieving over 98% accuracy and a normalized mean square error below 1e-3 for forecasting, and over 97% accuracy with faster convergence and fewer training parameters for classification. To enable edge deployment, the model is hardware-optimized by quantizing weights to INT4 or INT3 formats, resulting in only a 2% and 6% drop in classification accuracy during training and inference, respectively, while maintaining full accuracy for forecasting. Extensive simulations using multiple ECG datasets confirm the model's robustness. Future work includes implementing the algorithm on FPGA and CMOS circuits for practical cardiac monitoring, as well as developing a digital hardware platform that supports flexible neural network configurations and on-chip online training for personalized healthcare applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the brain and external equipment through EEG, which is preferred for its superior temporal resolution. Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</td>

While physiological measures show promise for error detection in laboratory settings, their effectiveness in dynamic flight environments remains underexplored. Through live flight trials with nine commercial pilots, we investigated whether established error-detection approaches maintain accuracy during actual flight operations. Participants completed standardized multi-tasking scenarios across conditions ranging from laboratory settings to straight-and-level flight and 2G manoeuvres while we collected synchronized physiological data. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based classification maintains high accuracy (87.83%) during complex flight manoeuvres, comparable to laboratory performance (89.23%). Eye-tracking showed moderate performance (82.50\%), while ECG performed near chance level (51.50%). Classification accuracy remained stable across flight conditions, with minimal degradation during 2G manoeuvres. These results provide the first evidence that physiological error detection can translate effectively to operational aviation environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early dementia diagnosis requires biomarkers sensitive to both structural and functional brain changes. While structural neuroimaging biomarkers have progressed significantly, objective functional biomarkers of early cognitive decline remain a critical unmet need. Current cognitive assessments often rely on behavioral responses, making them susceptible to factors like effort, practice effects, and educational background, thereby hindering early and accurate detection. This work introduces a novel approach, leveraging a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer cognitive impairment levels directly from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Critically, this method employs a passive fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm, eliminating the need for explicit behavioral responses or task comprehension from the participant. This passive approach provides an objective measure of working memory function, independent of confounding factors inherent in active cognitive tasks, and offers a promising new avenue for early and unbiased detection of cognitive decline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroadaptive haptics offers a path to more immersive extended reality (XR) experiences by dynamically tuning multisensory feedback to user preferences. We present a neuroadaptive haptics system that adapts XR feedback through reinforcement learning (RL) from explicit user ratings and brain-decoded neural signals. In a user study, participants interacted with virtual objects in VR while Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. An RL agent adjusted haptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural decoder. Results show that the RL agent's performance was comparable across feedback sources, suggesting that implicit neural feedback can effectively guide personalization without requiring active user input. The EEG-based neural decoder achieved a mean F1 score of 0.8, supporting reliable classification of user experience. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and RL to autonomously adapt XR interactions, reducing cognitive load and enhancing immersion.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the brain and external equipment through EEG, which is preferred for its superior temporal resolution. Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</td>

We present the Set-And-Forget EEG (SAFE) system, a custom-built amplifier and wireless transmitter meeting these criteria. This compact (12x12 mm), six-channel device offers 1024 Hz sampling and Bluetooth Low Energy data transmission. Validation using generated sinusoids and electrocorticography recordings of visual evoked potentials in sheep models demonstrated low noise recording. Future animal studies will assess sub-scalp EEG signal quality for BCI applications.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Robots with wheeled, quadrupedal, or humanoid forms are increasingly integrated into built environments. However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation. Overall, this research advances the development of cognitive robotics and socially guided learning for service robots in complex built environments.</td>

This study proposed a novel channel pruning model, plug-and-select (PlugSelect), applicable across a broad range of BCI paradigms with no additional training cost and plug-and-play functionality. It integrates gradients along the input path to globally infer the causal relationships between input channels and outputs, and ranks the contribution sequences to identify the most highly attributed channels. The results showed that for three BCI paradigms, i.e., auditory attention decoding (AAD), motor imagery (MI), affective computation (AC), PlugSelect could reduce the number of channels by at least half while effectively maintaining decoding performance and improving efficiency. The outcome benefits the design of wearable EEG-based devices, facilitating the practical application of BCI technology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional insights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics. Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting disease states from functional brain connectivity is critical for the early diagnosis of severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals. However, recent neuroscience studies found that such node-based connectivity does not accurately capture ``functional connections" within the brain. This paper proposes a novel approach to brain network analysis that emphasizes edge functional connectivity (eFC), shifting the focus to inter-edge relationships. Additionally, we introduce a co-embedding technique to integrate edge functional connections effectively. Experimental results on the ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN methods in classifying functional brain networks.</td>

Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are increasingly used to investigate brain activity by leveraging the complementary high spatial and high temporal resolution of fMRI and EEG signals respectively. It remains unclear, however, to what degree these two imaging modalities capture shared information about neural activity. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to predict both task-evoked and spontaneous fMRI signals of motor brain networks from EEG time-varying spectral power using interpretable models trained for individual subjects with Sparse Group Lasso regularization. Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects. These results present great potential for translation to EEG neurofeedback applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electrical potential scalp recordings (Electroencephalograms-EEGs) are a common tool used to investigate brain activity. EEG is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures." We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuro-developmental disorders are manifested as dysfunctions in cognition, communication, behaviour and adaptability, and deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can alleviate the increasingly strained healthcare resources on neuroimaging. However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In open data sets of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the heterogeneity of the data is typically attributed to a combination of factors, including differences in scanning procedures, the presence of confounding effects, and population diversities between multiple sites. These factors contribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in turn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning network (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a representation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly (NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC). This mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical directions, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize the feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module that can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior information. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of balancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression tasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy of 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces site variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain regions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering the "black box" of deep learning to a certain extent.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding currently faces significant challenges in individual differences, modality alignment, and high-dimensional embeddings. To address individual differences, researchers often use source subject data, which leads to issues such as privacy leakage and heavy data storage burdens. In modality alignment, current works focus on aligning the softmax probability distribution but neglect the alignment of marginal probability distributions, resulting in modality misalignment. Additionally, images and text are aligned separately with fMRI without considering the complex interplay between images and text, leading to poor image reconstruction. Finally, the enormous dimensionality of CLIP embeddings causes significant computational costs. Although the dimensionality of CLIP embeddings can be reduced by ignoring the number of patches obtained from images and the number of tokens acquired from text, this comes at the cost of a significant drop in model performance, creating a dilemma. To overcome these limitations, we propose a source-free domain adaptation-based brain decoding framework.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

In this work, we compute the monitoring edge-geodetic number efficiently for the following graph classes: distance-hereditary graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, and strongly chordal graphs. The algorithms follow from structural characterizations of the optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for these graph classes in terms of \emph{mandatory vertices} (those that need to be in every solution).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

This study investigated the impact of different CT-to-RED calibration curves on brain cancer treatment plans. Three calibration curves were compared: CIRS phantom-derived, Catphan phantom-derived, and the default curve in the Monaco Treatment Planning System. Ten volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated and recalculated using each curve. Dosimetric parameters for Planning Target Volume (PTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) were analyzed. Results showed significant differences in PTV dose distribution between the CIRS-derived and default curves, while no significant differences were found between Catphan-derived and default curves. The CIRS-derived curve demonstrated superior performance in representing brain tissue electron densities. These findings emphasize the importance of using site-specific CT-to-RED calibration curves for accurate dose calculations in brain radiotherapy, potentially improving treatment safety and efficacy</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is widely used for segmenting a diverse range of objects in natural images from simple user prompts like points or bounding boxes. However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied to non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's interactive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object, which is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous solutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large parts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as 2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case specialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM) method uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to adapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on multiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that prompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable parameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning SAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by up to 18% over state-of-the-art results. Since PTSAM can be reliably trained with as little as 16 annotated images, we find it particularly helpful for applications with limited training data and domain shifts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) is an experimental technique that increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by more than a factor of $10^5$, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans with their biochemical fates spatially resolvable over time following injection into a patient. dDNP requires a source of unpaired electrons to be in contact with the isotope-labelled nuclei, cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, and spin-pumped into a given state by microwave irradiation. At present, these electrons are typically provided by chemical radicals which require removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources include UV irradiation, requiring storing samples in liquid nitrogen, or cobalt-60 gamma irradiation, which requires days and generates polarisation two to three orders of magnitude lower than chemical radicals. In this study, we present ultra-high dose rate electron beam irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in glycerol/alanine mixtures. These radicals are stable for months at room temperature, are present at concentrations dependent on irradiation dose, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation to the typically used trityl radicals (20%) through a novel mechanism. The process of their generation inherently sterilises samples, and they enable the imaging of alanine metabolism in vivo using dDNP. This new method of generating radicals for dDNP offers the potential to report on relevant biological processes while being translatable to the clinic.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial plates or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. This method leads to improved results by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants. A comparison of the proposed method predictions with measurements performed on a cranial plate exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging is presented, showing an improved accuracy up to 25 % with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The proposed method is finally applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial plate is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment, predicting a temperature increase in proximity of the implant that is 10 % lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: A growing number of cancer patients with brain metastases can benefit from stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) thanks to recent advances in systemic therapies. With an increasing patient load, single-isocenter treatments on widely available C-arm linear accelerators are an attractive option. However, the planning of such treatments is challenging for multi-target cases due to the island blocking problem, which occurs when the multi-leaf collimator cannot conform to all targets simultaneously.   Purpose: We propose a multi-target partitioning algorithm that mitigates excessive exposure of normal tissue caused by the island blocking problem.   Methods: The algorithm divides (partitions) the set of targets into subsets to treat with separate arc passes, optimizing both subsets and collimator angles to minimize island blocking. The algorithm was incorporated into a fully automated treatment planning script and evaluated on 20 simulated patient cases, each with 10 brain metastases and 21 Gy prescriptions. It was also retrospectively evaluated on six clinical cases.   Results: Partitioning significantly improved the gradient index, global efficiency index, and brain V12Gy compared to simultaneous treatment of all metastases. For example, the average gradient index improved from 5.9 to 3.3, global efficiency index from 0.32 to 0.46, and normal brain V12Gy from 49 cm3 to 26 cm3 between 3 and 9 arcs. The proposed algorithm outperformed baselines in utilizing a limited number of arcs. All target partitioning strategies increased the total number of monitor units (MUs).   Conclusions: The dose gradient in single-isocenter VMAT plans can be substantially improved by treating a smaller subset of metastases at a time. This requires more MUs and arcs, implying a trade-off between delivery time and plan quality which can be explored using the algorithm proposed in this paper.</td>

Traditional methods, relying on rule-based or shallow machine learning techniques, struggle to capture deep and implicit semantics.

We propose EMRModel, a novel approach that integrates LoRA-based fine-tuning with code-style prompt design, aiming to efficiently convert medical consultation dialogues into structured electronic medical records (EMRs). Additionally, we construct a high-quality, realistically grounded dataset of medical consultation dialogues with detailed annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation benchmark for medical consultation information extraction and provide a systematic evaluation methodology, advancing the optimization of medical natural language processing (NLP) models. Experimental results show EMRModel achieves an F1 score of 88.1%, improving by49.5% over standard pre-trained models. Compared to traditional LoRA fine-tuning methods, our model shows superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in structured medical record extraction tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Three-dimensional (3D) refractive index (RI) tomography offers label-free, quantitative volumetric imaging but faces limitations due to optical aberrations, limited resolution, and the computational complexity inherent to existing approaches. To overcome these barriers, we propose Analytic Fourier Ptychotomography (AFP), a new computational microscopy technique that analytically reconstructs aberration-free, complex-valued 3D RI distributions without iterative optimization or axial scanning. AFP incorporates a new concept called the finite sample thickness (FST) prior, and analytically solves the inverse scattering problem through three sequential steps: complex-field reconstruction via the Kramers-Kronig relation, linear aberration correction using overlapping spectra, and analytic spectrum extension into the darkfield region. Unlike iterative reconstruction methods, AFP does not require parameter tuning or computationally intensive optimizations, which are often error-prone and non-generalizable. We experimentally demonstrate that AFP significantly enhances image quality and resolution under various aberration conditions across a range of applications. AFP corrected aberrations associated with 25 Zernike modes (with a maximal phase difference of 2.3$\pi$ and maximal Zernike coefficient value of 4), extended the synthetic numerical aperture from 0.41 to 0.99, and provided a two-fold resolution enhancement in all directions. AFP's simplicity and robustness make it an attractive imaging technology for quantitative 3D analysis in biological, microbial ecological, and medical studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Imaging the human body's morphological and angiographic information is essential for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. Ultrasonography performs the morphological assessment of the soft tissue based on acoustic impedance variations, whereas photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can visualize blood vessels based on intrinsic hemoglobin absorption. Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV) probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously. The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast, hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution, and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for rapid clinical translation.</td>
