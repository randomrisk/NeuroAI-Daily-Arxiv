<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying areas where the signal is prominent is an important task in image analysis, with particular applications in brain mapping. In this work, we develop confidence regions for spatial excursion sets above and below a given level. We achieve this by treating the confidence procedure as a testing problem at the given level, allowing control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project illustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recommender systems play a central role in numerous real-life applications, yet evaluating their performance remains a significant challenge due to the gap between offline metrics and online behaviors. Given the scarcity and limits (e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, we introduce SimUSER, an agent framework that serves as believable and cost-effective human proxies. SimUSER first identifies self-consistent personas from historical data, enriching user profiles with unique backgrounds and personalities. Then, central to this evaluation are users equipped with persona, memory, perception, and brain modules, engaging in interactions with the recommender system. SimUSER exhibits closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally, we conduct insightful experiments to explore the effects of thumbnails on click rates, the exposure effect, and the impact of reviews on user engagement. Finally, we refine recommender system parameters based on offline A/B test results, resulting in improved user engagement in the real world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice. Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being recorded on video (two instances doing "from scratch" and two instances after AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI images obtained from patients with brain metastases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.Our code is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Blood vessel networks in the brain play a crucial role in stroke research, where understanding their topology is essential for analyzing blood flow dynamics. However, extracting detailed topological vessel network information from microscopy data remains a significant challenge, mainly due to the scarcity of labeled training data and the need for high topological accuracy. This work combines synthetic data generation with deep learning to automatically extract vessel networks as graphs from volumetric microscopy data. To combat data scarcity, we introduce a comprehensive pipeline for generating large-scale synthetic datasets that mirror the characteristics of real vessel networks. Our three-stage approach progresses from abstract graph generation through vessel mask creation to realistic medical image synthesis, incorporating biological constraints and imaging artifacts at each stage. Using this synthetic data, we develop a two-stage deep learning pipeline of 3D U-Net-based models for node detection and edge prediction. Fine-tuning on real microscopy data shows promising adaptation, improving edge prediction F1 scores from 0.496 to 0.626 by training on merely 5 manually labeled samples. These results suggest that automated vessel network extraction is becoming practically feasible, opening new possibilities for large-scale vascular analysis in stroke research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and self-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some graph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive, and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations -- for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE), conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume prediction, with Pearson correlation coefficients reaching 0.80, 0.82, and 0.70 between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human error remains a critical concern in aviation safety, contributing to 70-80% of accidents despite technological advancements. While physiological measures show promise for error detection in laboratory settings, their effectiveness in dynamic flight environments remains underexplored. Through live flight trials with nine commercial pilots, we investigated whether established error-detection approaches maintain accuracy during actual flight operations. Participants completed standardized multi-tasking scenarios across conditions ranging from laboratory settings to straight-and-level flight and 2G manoeuvres while we collected synchronized physiological data. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based classification maintains high accuracy (87.83%) during complex flight manoeuvres, comparable to laboratory performance (89.23%). Eye-tracking showed moderate performance (82.50\%), while ECG performed near chance level (51.50%). Classification accuracy remained stable across flight conditions, with minimal degradation during 2G manoeuvres. These results provide the first evidence that physiological error detection can translate effectively to operational aviation environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early dementia diagnosis requires biomarkers sensitive to both structural and functional brain changes. While structural neuroimaging biomarkers have progressed significantly, objective functional biomarkers of early cognitive decline remain a critical unmet need. Current cognitive assessments often rely on behavioral responses, making them susceptible to factors like effort, practice effects, and educational background, thereby hindering early and accurate detection. This work introduces a novel approach, leveraging a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer cognitive impairment levels directly from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Critically, this method employs a passive fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm, eliminating the need for explicit behavioral responses or task comprehension from the participant. This passive approach provides an objective measure of working memory function, independent of confounding factors inherent in active cognitive tasks, and offers a promising new avenue for early and unbiased detection of cognitive decline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are increasingly used to investigate brain activity by leveraging the complementary high spatial and high temporal resolution of fMRI and EEG signals respectively. It remains unclear, however, to what degree these two imaging modalities capture shared information about neural activity. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to predict both task-evoked and spontaneous fMRI signals of motor brain networks from EEG time-varying spectral power using interpretable models trained for individual subjects with Sparse Group Lasso regularization. Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects. These results present great potential for translation to EEG neurofeedback applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Robots with wheeled, quadrupedal, or humanoid forms are increasingly integrated into built environments. However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation. Overall, this research advances the development of cognitive robotics and socially guided learning for service robots in complex built environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electrical potential scalp recordings (Electroencephalograms-EEGs) are a common tool used to investigate brain activity. EEG is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition is an important component of affective computing, and also human-machine interaction. Unimodal emotion recognition is convenient, but the accuracy may not be high enough; on the contrary, multi-modal emotion recognition may be more accurate, but it also increases the complexity and cost of the data collection system. This paper considers cross-modal emotion recognition, i.e., using both electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement in training, but only EEG or eye movement in test. We propose cross-modal contrastive representation distillation (CMCRD), which uses a pre-trained eye movement classification model to assist the training of an EEG classification model, improving feature extraction from EEG signals, or vice versa. During test, only EEG signals (or eye movement signals) are acquired, eliminating the need for multi-modal data. CMCRD not only improves the emotion recognition accuracy, but also makes the system more simplified and practical. Experiments using three different neural network architectures on three multi-modal emotion recognition datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of CMCRD. Compared with the EEG-only model, it improved the average classification accuracy by about 6.2%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate and efficient perception of emotional states in oneself and others is crucial, as emotion-related disorders are associated with severe psychosocial impairments. While electroencephalography (EEG) offers a powerful tool for emotion detection, current EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) methods face key limitations: insufficient model stability, limited accuracy in processing high-dimensional nonlinear EEG signals, and poor robustness against intra-subject variability and signal noise. To address these challenges, we propose LEREL (Lipschitz continuity-constrained Emotion Recognition Ensemble Learning), a novel framework that significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition performance. The LEREL framework employs Lipschitz continuity constraints to enhance model stability and generalization in EEG emotion recognition, reducing signal variability and noise susceptibility while maintaining strong performance on small-sample datasets. The ensemble learning strategy reduces single-model bias and variance through multi-classifier decision fusion, further optimizing overall performance. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets (EAV, FACED and SEED) demonstrate LEREL's effectiveness, achieving average recognition accuracies of 76.43%, 83.00% and 89.22%, respectively.</td>

It integrates gradients along the input path to globally infer the causal relationships between input channels and outputs, and ranks the contribution sequences to identify the most highly attributed channels. The results showed that for three BCI paradigms, i.e., auditory attention decoding (AAD), motor imagery (MI), affective computation (AC), PlugSelect could reduce the number of channels by at least half while effectively maintaining decoding performance and improving efficiency.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current brain-computer interfaces (BCI) face limitations in signal acquisition. While sub-scalp EEG offers a potential solution, existing devices prioritize chronic seizure monitoring and lack features suited for BCI applications. This work addresses this gap by outlining key specifications for sub-scalp BCI devices, focusing on channel count, sampling rate, power efficiency, and form factor. We present the Set-And-Forget EEG (SAFE) system, a custom-built amplifier and wireless transmitter meeting these criteria. This compact (12x12 mm), six-channel device offers 1024 Hz sampling and Bluetooth Low Energy data transmission. Validation using generated sinusoids and electrocorticography recordings of visual evoked potentials in sheep models demonstrated low noise recording. Future animal studies will assess sub-scalp EEG signal quality for BCI applications. This data lays the groundwork for human trials, ultimately paving the way for chronic, in-home BCIs that empower individuals with physical disabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.Our code is available in https://github.com/sddwwww/Mind2Matter.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early dementia diagnosis requires biomarkers sensitive to both structural and functional brain changes. While structural neuroimaging biomarkers have progressed significantly, objective functional biomarkers of early cognitive decline remain a critical unmet need. Current cognitive assessments often rely on behavioral responses, making them susceptible to factors like effort, practice effects, and educational background, thereby hindering early and accurate detection. This work introduces a novel approach, leveraging a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer cognitive impairment levels directly from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Critically, this method employs a passive fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm, eliminating the need for explicit behavioral responses or task comprehension from the participant. This passive approach provides an objective measure of working memory function, independent of confounding factors inherent in active cognitive tasks, and offers a promising new avenue for early and unbiased detection of cognitive decline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-quality, multi-channel neural recording is indispensable for neuroscience research and clinical applications. Large-scale brain recordings often produce vast amounts of data that must be wirelessly transmitted for subsequent offline analysis and decoding, especially in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) utilizing high-density intracortical recordings with hundreds or thousands of electrodes. However, transmitting raw neural data presents significant challenges due to limited communication bandwidth and resultant excessive heating. To address this challenge, we propose a neural signal compression scheme utilizing Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs), which achieves a compression ratio of up to 150 for compressing local field potentials (LFPs). The CAE encoder section is implemented on RAMAN, an energy-efficient tinyML accelerator designed for edge computing, and subsequently deployed on an Efinix Ti60 FPGA with 37.3k LUTs and 8.6k register utilization. RAMAN leverages sparsity in activation and weights through zero skipping, gating, and weight compression techniques. Additionally, we employ hardware-software co-optimization by pruning CAE encoder model parameters using a hardware-aware balanced stochastic pruning strategy, resolving workload imbalance issues and eliminating indexing overhead to reduce parameter storage requirements by up to 32.4%. Using the proposed compact depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder (DS-CAE) model, the compressed neural data from RAMAN is reconstructed offline with superior signal-to-noise and distortion ratios (SNDR) of 22.6 dB and 27.4 dB, along with R2 scores of 0.81 and 0.94, respectively, evaluated on two monkey neural recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining serves as a valuable technique for detecting specific antigens or proteins through antibody-mediated visualization. However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition is crucial for advancing mental health, healthcare, and technologies like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based emotion recognition models face challenges in cross-domain applications due to the high cost of labeled data and variations in EEG signals from individual differences and recording conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation methods typically require access to source domain data, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios due to privacy and computational constraints. Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SF-UDA) has recently emerged as a solution, enabling target domain adaptation without source data, but its application in emotion recognition remains unexplored. We propose a novel SF-UDA approach for EEG-based emotion classification across domains, introducing a multi-stage framework that enhances model adaptability without requiring source data. Our approach incorporates Dual-Loss Adaptive Regularization (DLAR) to minimize prediction discrepancies on confident samples and align predictions with expected pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce Localized Consistency Learning (LCL), which enforces local consistency by promoting similar predictions from reliable neighbors. These techniques together address domain shift and reduce the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, a key challenge in traditional SF-UDA models. Experiments on two widely used datasets, DEAP and SEED, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 65.84% accuracy when trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, and 58.99% accuracy in the reverse scenario. It excels at detecting both positive and negative emotions, making it well-suited for practical emotion recognition applications.</td>

Recent studies have reported higher-than-chance performance in decoding handwritten letters from EEG signals, potentially allowing these subjects to communicate. However, all prior works have attempted to decode handwriting from EEG during actual motion. Furthermore, they assume that precise movement-onset is known. In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI.</td>

Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level.

Here, we investigate whether it is possible to predict both task-evoked and spontaneous fMRI signals of motor brain networks from EEG time-varying spectral power using interpretable models trained for individual subjects with Sparse Group Lasso regularization. Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects. These results present great potential for translation to EEG neurofeedback applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electrical potential scalp recordings (Electroencephalograms-EEGs) are a common tool used to investigate brain activity. EEG is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures." We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuro-developmental disorders are manifested as dysfunctions in cognition, communication, behaviour and adaptability, and deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can alleviate the increasingly strained healthcare resources on neuroimaging. However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In open data sets of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the heterogeneity of the data is typically attributed to a combination of factors, including differences in scanning procedures, the presence of confounding effects, and population diversities between multiple sites. These factors contribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in turn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning network (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a representation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly (NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC). This mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical directions, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize the feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module that can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior information. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of balancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression tasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy of 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces site variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain regions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering the "black box" of deep learning to a certain extent.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding currently faces significant challenges in individual differences, modality alignment, and high-dimensional embeddings. To address individual differences, researchers often use source subject data, which leads to issues such as privacy leakage and heavy data storage burdens. In modality alignment, current works focus on aligning the softmax probability distribution but neglect the alignment of marginal probability distributions, resulting in modality misalignment. Additionally, images and text are aligned separately with fMRI without considering the complex interplay between images and text, leading to poor image reconstruction. Finally, the enormous dimensionality of CLIP embeddings causes significant computational costs. Although the dimensionality of CLIP embeddings can be reduced by ignoring the number of patches obtained from images and the number of tokens acquired from text, this comes at the cost of a significant drop in model performance, creating a dilemma. To overcome these limitations, we propose a source-free domain adaptation-based brain decoding framework.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In modern society, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the common mental diseases discovered not only in children but also in adults. In this context, we propose a ADHD diagnosis transformer model that can effectively simultaneously find important brain spatiotemporal biomarkers from resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI). This model not only learns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with full attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it focuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and distinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically, the three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows. First, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive embedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the previously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for individual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to local temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features of fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal features with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI, ROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI relationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types of transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939 individuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this, the spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the performance of other different types of transformer variants. (77.78ACC 76.60SPE 79.22SEN 79.30AUC)</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional causal connectivity methods in task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) face challenges in accurately capturing directed information flow due to their sensitivity to noise and inability to model multivariate dependencies. These limitations hinder the effective comparison of brain networks between cognitive states, making it difficult to analyze network reconfiguration during task and resting states. To address these issues, we propose BOLDSimNet, a novel framework utilizing Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) to measure causal connectivity and network similarity across different cognitive states. Our method groups functionally similar regions of interest (ROIs) rather than spatially adjacent nodes, improving accuracy in network alignment. We applied BOLDSimNet to fMRI data from 40 healthy controls and found that children exhibited higher similarity scores between task and resting states compared to adolescents, indicating reduced variability in attention shifts. In contrast, adolescents showed more differences between task and resting states in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN), reflecting enhanced network adaptability. These findings emphasize developmental variations in the reconfiguration of the causal brain network, showcasing BOLDSimNet's ability to quantify network similarity and identify attentional fluctuations between different cognitive states.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume.

However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural information. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce coordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization of irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short neighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM blocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate the proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named MedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at https://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. Code is merged to a public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.</td>

As machine learning techniques enhance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems, ensuring safety and stability remains a critical challenge, especially in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical decision-making, and energy systems. We explore various approaches for embedding and ensuring safety constraints, such as structural priors, Lyapunov functions, Control Barrier Functions, predictive control, projections, and robust optimization techniques, ensuring that the learned models respect stability and safety criteria. Additionally, we delve into methods for uncertainty quantification and safety verification, including reachability analysis and neural network verification tools, which help validate that control policies remain within safe operating bounds even in uncertain environments. The paper includes illustrative examples demonstrating the implementation aspects of safe learning frameworks that combine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical principles, offering a path toward the safe control of complex dynamical systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Whether for materials processing or medical applications, the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) has emerged as a relevant alternative to conventional methods. Within the APPJs research field, the search for innovation aims not only to solve existing problems, but also to explore novel options for generating plasma jets and find new possible applications. In this work, the properties of $\rm{Ar-H_2}$ APPJs generated using two plasma sources, which differ basically in the generated voltage frequency, amplitude and waveform, were studied through electrical, thermal and optical characterization. Discharge and plasma parameters were analyzed as a function of the $\rm{H_2}$ content in the gas mixture, with this parameter varying from $0\%$ to $3.5\%$. In all cases, the discharge power, electron density as well as the rotational, vibrational and gas temperatures presented a trend of growing when the proportion of $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas composition was increased. Optical emission spectroscopy revealed that the same reactive species were produced for both plasma sources, except for nitric oxide (NO), which was observed only for the one operated at higher frequency (PS #1). Applications on polymer (polypropylene, PP) and water treatment were performed using PS #1 without $\rm{H_2}$ and with $3.5\%$ of $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas mixture. NH functional groups were detected on the PP surface in the presence of $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas composition. This indicates a possible way to increase the nitrogen content on polymer surfaces. The results of water treatment revealed that ammonia ($\rm{NH_3}$) is also produced when there is $\rm{H_2}$ in the working gas. This opens an alternative for the use of plasma treated water in agriculture.</td>

We present an approach to computer-aided design and precision assessment of positioning occlusal splints, bridging clinical concepts with current digital dental practice. In our model, a 3D splint is generated based on a transformation matrix that represents the therapeutic change in mandibular position, defined by a specialist using a virtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans and plaster model digitisation. The paper introduces a novel method for generating splints that accurately reproduce occlusal conditions in the therapeutic position, including a mechanism for resolving surface conflicts through virtual embossing. We demonstrate how transformation matrices can be acquired through clinical tools and intraoral devices, and evaluate the accuracy of the designed and printed splints using profile and surface deviation analysis. The proposed method enables reproducible, patient-specific splint fabrication and opens new possibilities in diagnostics, multimodal image registration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies.</td>

However, traditional segmentation models often struggle with complex cellular structures and variations in pap smear images. This study proposes a hybrid Dense-UNet201 optimization approach that integrates a pretrained DenseNet201 as the encoder for the U-Net architecture and optimizes it using the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm. The Dense-UNet201 model excelled at feature extraction. The SMO was modified to handle categorical and discrete parameters. The SIPaKMeD dataset was used in this study and evaluated using key performance metrics, including loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient. The experimental results showed that Dense-UNet201 outperformed U-Net, Res-UNet50, and Efficient-UNetB0. SMO Dense-UNet201 achieved a segmentation accuracy of 96.16%, an IoU of 91.63%, and a Dice coefficient score of 95.63%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of image preprocessing, pretrained models, and metaheuristic optimization in improving medical image analysis and provide new insights into cervical cell segmentation methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Chinese-Vicuna is an open-source, resource-efficient language model designed to bridge the gap in Chinese instruction-following capabilities by fine-tuning Meta's LLaMA architecture using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Targeting low-resource environments, it enables cost-effective deployment on consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX-2080Ti for 7B models) and supports domain-specific adaptation in fields like healthcare and law. By integrating hybrid datasets (BELLE and Guanaco) and 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), the model achieves competitive performance in tasks such as translation, code generation, and domain-specific Q\&A. The project provides a comprehensive toolkit for model conversion, CPU inference, and multi-turn dialogue interfaces, emphasizing accessibility for researchers and developers. Evaluations indicate competitive performance across medical tasks, multi-turn dialogue coherence, and real-time legal updates. Chinese-Vicuna's modular design, open-source ecosystem, and community-driven enhancements position it as a versatile foundation for Chinese LLM applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces AdaptoVision, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed to efficiently balance computational complexity and classification accuracy. By leveraging enhanced residual units, depth-wise separable convolutions, and hierarchical skip connections, AdaptoVision significantly reduces parameter count and computational requirements while preserving competitive performance across various benchmark and medical image datasets. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that AdaptoVision achieves state-of-the-art on BreakHis dataset and comparable accuracy levels, notably 95.3\% on CIFAR-10 and 85.77\% on CIFAR-100, without relying on any pretrained weights. The model's streamlined architecture and strategic simplifications promote effective feature extraction and robust generalization, making it particularly suitable for deployment in real-time and resource-constrained environments.</td>
