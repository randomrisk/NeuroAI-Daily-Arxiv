<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reliable in-vitro models are used for optoelectronic device development such as fluorescence detection devices for fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas. A common approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed by a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which fluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and physiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This limits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where consistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is needed. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple replication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models. In this study, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX fluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution into the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site simulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region had a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease towards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was compared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other reported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was tested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence (AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was analysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain sample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to maintain moisture and preserve AF. The model accurately replicated surgical fluorescence conditions and offers a suitable alternative to glioma induction, benefiting the development of fluorescence detection devices across design iterations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discerning the neurotransmitter dysregulation is a hallmark of neurological disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. The concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft is particularly low, ranging from nM to fM, which makes it challenging to accurately monitor changes over the course of a clinical trial using existing sensing techniques. By means of an advanced whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensor hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas, we detect and discriminate between different neurotransmitters at the single-molecule level. Our results show that the sensor can detect neurotransmitters with exceptional sensitivity down to 10 aM and discriminate between structurally similar neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, over a large number of detection events. Furthermore, we find that the average WGM resonance shift, induced by a neurotransmitter binding to the sensor, strongly correlates with molecular polarizability values obtained from electronic structure calculations. These findings establish the optoplasmonic WGM sensors as potential biosensor platform in different avenues of neuroscience by detecting and discriminating neurotransmitters as well as investigating their dynamics at ultra low-level concentrations, plausibly contributing to deeper understanding of brain function and neurological disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decomposing multivariate time series with certain basic dynamics is crucial for understanding, predicting and controlling nonlinear spatiotemporally dynamic systems such as the brain. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method for decomposing nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics into several basic dynamics (dynamic modes; DMs) with intrinsic frequencies and decay rates. In particular, unlike Fourier transform-based methods, which are used to decompose a single-channel signal into the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves with discrete frequencies at a regular interval, DMD can derive the intrinsic frequencies of a multichannel signal on the basis of the available data; furthermore, it can capture nonstationary components such as alternations between states with different intrinsic frequencies. Here, we propose the use of the distribution of intrinsic frequencies derived from DMDs (DM frequencies) to characterise neural activities. The distributions of DM frequencies in the electroencephalograms of healthy subjects and patients with dementia or Parkinson's disease in a resting state were evaluated. By using the distributions, these patients were distinguished from healthy subjects with significantly greater accuracy than when using amplitude spectra derived by discrete Fourier transform. This finding suggests that the distribution of DM frequencies exhibits distinct behaviour from amplitude spectra, and therefore, the distribution may serve as a new biomarker by characterising the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A broad range of applications involve signals with irregular structures that can be represented as a graph. As the underlying structures can change over time, the tracking dynamic graph topologies from observed signals is a fundamental challenge in graph signal processing (GSP), with applications in various domains, such as power systems, the brain-machine interface, and communication systems. In this paper, we propose a method for tracking dynamic changes in graph topologies. Our approach builds on a representation of the dynamics as a graph-based nonlinear state-space model (SSM), where the observations are graph signals generated through graph filtering, and the underlying evolving topology serves as the latent states. In our formulation, the graph Laplacian matrix is parameterized using the incidence matrix and edge weights, enabling a structured representation of the state. In order to track the evolving topology in the resulting SSM, we develop a sparsity-aware extended Kalman filter (EKF) that integrates $\ell_1$-regularized updates within the filtering process. Furthermore, a dynamic programming scheme to efficiently compute the Jacobian of the graph filter is introduced. Our numerical study demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to accurately track sparse and time-varying graphs under realistic conditions, with highly nonlinear measurements, various noise levels, and different change rates, while maintaining low computational complexity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision transformer-based deep learning framework.   Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia) and amyloid status classification.   Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of 95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model predictions.   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited biomedical settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System (EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy, resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators, and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Slow-paced breathing is a promising intervention for reducing anxiety and enhancing emotional regulation through its effects on autonomic and central nervous system function. This study examined the neurophysiological and subjective effects of a 5:5 breathing protocol on stress-related EEG biomarkers using a mobile single-channel EEG system. Thirty-eight healthy adults were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 20), which completed two sessions spaced two weeks apart with daily breathing practice, or a control group (n = 18), which completed one session. In each session, participants underwent an auditory EEG assessment with resting, mental load, and startle conditions. The intervention group also completed a guided breathing session during the first visit and practiced the technique between sessions. EEG biomarkers (ST4, Alpha, Delta, Gamma, VC0) and subjective anxiety levels (STAI) were assessed before and after the intervention. A significant reduction in Gamma power was observed in the intervention group immediately following the first breathing session during mental load (p = .002), indicating acute stress reduction. Across sessions, long-term breathing practice led to increased Alpha and Delta power and reduced ST4 activity, suggesting cumulative improvements in emotional regulation and cognitive efficiency. Correlational analyses revealed that changes in VC0 and Alpha were significantly associated with subjective reports of tension, focus difficulty, and calmness. Guided slow-paced breathing at a 5:5 rhythm produces both immediate and sustained effects on neural markers of stress and cognition, with corresponding improvements in subjective anxiety. These findings support EEG-based monitoring as a scalable method for evaluating breath-based interventions and promoting real-time emotional self-regulation.</td>

This study evaluated whether a single-channel high-density EEG (hdrEEG) system could dissociate cognitive and stress-related activity during a brief auditory task-based protocol. Sixty-eight healthy adults completed resting state recordings, cognitively demanding auditory tasks, and exposure to unpredictable literalized startle stimuli. Participants also rated their stress and anxiety using a modified State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). EEG analysis focused on frequency bands (Theta, Gamma, Delta) and machine-learning-derived features (A0, ST4, VC9, T2). A double dissociation emerged: Theta and VC9 increased under cognitive load but not startle, supporting their sensitivity to executive function. In contrast, Gamma and A0 were elevated by the startle stimulus, consistent with stress reactivity. ST4 tracked cognitive effort and worry, while T2 negatively correlated with self-reported calmness, indicating relevance to emotional regulation. These results demonstrate that a short, uniform assessment using portable EEG can yield multiple reliable biomarkers of cognitive and affective states. The findings have implications for clinical, occupational, and educational settings, and may inform future neurofeedback protocols targeting simultaneous regulation of attention and stress.</td>

While EEG-based measures are emerging as promising alternatives to conventional assessment techniques, such as selfreport measures, studies examining consistency across these different methodologies are limited. In a preliminary study, we observed indications of potential discrepancies between EEGbased and self-reported MW measures. Motivated by these preliminary observations, our study further explores the discrepancies between EEG-based and self-reported MW assessment methods through an experiment involving visualization tasks. In the experiment, we employ two benchmark tasks: the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) and a Spatial Visualization (SV) task. EEG signals are recorded from participants using a 32-channel system at a sampling rate of 128 Hz during the visualization tasks. For each participant, MW is estimated using an EEG-based model built on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture, and these estimates are compared with conventional MW measures to examine potential discrepancies. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies between task difficulty and EEG-based MW estimates, as well as between EEG-based and self-reported MW measures across varying task difficulty levels. Additionally, the observed patterns suggest the presence of unconscious cognitive effort that may not be captured by selfreport alone.</td>

The model was trained on data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance, achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data. The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.   Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.   Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.   Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity (except slow frontal activity).   Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity. Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits, which are specific to each of the disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying what aspects of brain activity are responsible for conscious perception remains one of the most challenging problems in science. While progress has been made through psychophysical studies employing EEG and fMRI, research would greatly benefit from improved methods for stimulating the brain in healthy human subjects. Traditional techniques for neural stimulation through the skull, including electrical or magnetic stimulation, suffer from coarse spatial resolution and have limited ability to target deep brain structures with high spatial selectivity. Over the past decade, a new tool has emerged known as transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which enables the human brain to be stimulated safely and non-invasively through the skull with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, including cortical as well as deep brain structures. This tool offers an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs in consciousness research. Given the extensive preparation and regulatory approvals associated with tFUS testing, careful experimental planning is essential. Therefore, our goal here is to provide a roadmap for using tFUS in humans for exploring the neural substrate of conscious perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important, low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding speech from brain signals is a challenging research problem. Although existing technologies have made progress in reconstructing the mel spectrograms of auditory stimuli at the word or letter level, there remain core challenges in the precise reconstruction of minute-level continuous imagined speech: traditional models struggle to balance the efficiency of temporal dependency modeling and information retention in long-sequence decoding. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network (DMF2Mel), which consists of four core components: the Dynamic Contrastive Feature Aggregation Module (DC-FAM), the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Network (HAMS-Net), the SplineMap attention mechanism, and the bidirectional state space module (convMamba). Specifically, the DC-FAM separates speech-related "foreground features" from noisy "background features" through local convolution and global attention mechanisms, effectively suppressing interference and enhancing the representation of transient signals. HAMS-Net, based on the U-Net framework,achieves cross-scale fusion of high-level semantics and low-level details. The SplineMap attention mechanism integrates the Adaptive Gated Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AGKAN) to combine global context modeling with spline-based local fitting. The convMamba captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity and enhances nonlinear dynamic modeling capabilities. Results on the SparrKULee dataset show that DMF2Mel achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.074 in mel spectrogram reconstruction for known subjects (a 48% improvement over the baseline) and 0.048 for unknown subjects (a 35% improvement over the baseline).Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DMF2Mel.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer a safe and accessible means of connecting the human brain to external devices, with broad applications in home and clinical settings to enhance human capabilities. However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate models in various scenarios. We make our benchmark pipeline available to enable reproducible research and external use, offering a continuously evolving platform to foster progress toward robust and generalized neural decoding solutions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).   We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.</td>

Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture, which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these, Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic Transformer with other deep learning techniques (convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for future research endeavors.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.</td>

It remains unknown whether non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can support volitional communication in CLIS. Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered "Yes"/"No" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring basic communication in CLIS.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviors; however, objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain lacking. We propose a coevolutionary balance paradigm that quantifies network level energy via a Hamiltonian integrating regional activity measured by fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and resting state functional connectivity (FC). Analysis of resting state fMRI data from 93 adult males with ASD and 93 matched controls revealed that empirical networks showed lower energy than 1000 topology preserving null models (paired t = -4.12, p less than or equal to 1e-4). Participants with ASD exhibited more negative whole brain energy (t = -3.239, p = 0.0015), driven by increased agreement links and reduced imbalanced same motifs. Subnetwork analysis indicated greater energy in the Default Mode Network after false discovery rate correction (p less than 0.016) and enhanced energy between the Default Mode, Salience and Dorsal Attention networks (p less than 0.032). Energy metrics and inter network connectivity correlated with Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule severity scores (absolute correlation greater than or equal to 0.29, p less than 0.02). A k nearest neighbors classifier using nine principal features including motif proportions, global node link alignment, inter network fALFF weighted and FC strengths, subnetwork magnetization and pairwise energy achieved an accuracy of 79 percent with balanced sensitivity and specificity.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets. CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been commonly used to construct functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of the human brain. TFCNs are primarily limited to quantifying pairwise relationships between ROIs ignoring higher order dependencies between multiple brain regions. Recently, hypergraph construction methods from fMRI time series data have been proposed to characterize the high-order relations among multiple ROIs. While there have been multiple methods for constructing hypergraphs from fMRI time series, the question of how to characterize the topology of these hypergraphs remains open. In this paper, we make two key contributions to the field of community detection in brain hypernetworks. First, we construct a hypergraph for each subject capturing high order dependencies between regions. Second, we introduce a spectral clustering based approach on hypergraphs to detect overlapping community structure. Finally, the proposed method is implemented to detect the consensus community structure across multiple subjects. The proposed method is applied to resting state fMRI data from Human Connectome Project to summarize the overlapping community structure across a group of healthy young adults.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying what aspects of brain activity are responsible for conscious perception remains one of the most challenging problems in science. While progress has been made through psychophysical studies employing EEG and fMRI, research would greatly benefit from improved methods for stimulating the brain in healthy human subjects. Traditional techniques for neural stimulation through the skull, including electrical or magnetic stimulation, suffer from coarse spatial resolution and have limited ability to target deep brain structures with high spatial selectivity. Over the past decade, a new tool has emerged known as transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which enables the human brain to be stimulated safely and non-invasively through the skull with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, including cortical as well as deep brain structures. This tool offers an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs in consciousness research. Given the extensive preparation and regulatory approvals associated with tFUS testing, careful experimental planning is essential. Therefore, our goal here is to provide a roadmap for using tFUS in humans for exploring the neural substrate of conscious perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Historically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has focused primarily on gray matter, particularly the cortical gray matter and associated nuclei. However, recent work has demonstrated that functional activity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and learning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global patterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled exploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical harmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via GitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the source code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized version of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple public datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of functional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high angular resolution functional correlations. The key innovation of this work is the containerized implementation, which we have made available under a permissive open-source license to support reproducible and accessible research practices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How does the information flow between different brain regions during various stimuli? This is the question we aim to address by studying complex cognitive paradigms in terms of Information Theory. To assess creativity and the emergence of patterns from a Shannon perspective, we applied a range of tools, including Entropy Density, Effective Measure Complexity, and the Lempel-Ziv distance. These entropic tools enable the detection of both linear and non-linear dynamics without relying on pre-established parameters, models, or prior assumptions about the data. To identify connections between different brain regions, we analyse task-based fMRI data from subjects during motor, working memory, emotion recognition, and language stimuli to gain insight into these complex cognitive processes. Since this method does not rely on prior knowledge, it is particularly well-suited for exploratory research, facilitating the discovery of previously unidentified connections or patterns in the brain. The capacity to identify non-linear dynamics is especially important for studying brain connectivity, as the brain exhibits significant non-linear interactions across multiple functional levels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods, including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress, reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions, particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark, which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies. Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups. Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples), overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally efficient framework for nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization. Although conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in the studied scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system (SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to 99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3% accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults, but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions, regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets, 1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55% on four remote sensing datasets.

With the iterative improvement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, AI holds significant potential to mitigate medical misdiagnoses by preventing numerous deaths and reducing an economic burden of approximately 450 EUR billion annually. However, a key obstacle to AI adoption lies in the lack of transparency: many automated systems function as "black boxes," providing predictions without revealing the underlying processes. This opacity can hinder experts' ability to trust and rely on AI systems. Visual analytics (VA) provides a compelling solution by combining AI models with interactive visualizations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MEDebiaser, an interactive system enabling physicians to directly refine AI models using local explanations. By combining prediction with attention loss functions and employing a customized ranking strategy to alleviate scalability, MEDebiaser allows physicians to mitigate biases without technical expertise, reducing reliance on engineers, and thus enhancing more direct human-AI feedback.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region.</td>

Linguistic tools, specifically, dependency tree, which organizes a sentence into different semantic units have been shown to be very effective for extracting semantic pairs from a sentence, but existing supervised methods do not have any provision for utilizing such tools within their model framework. In this work, we propose DepBERT, which extends a transformer-based model by incorporating dependency tree of a sentence within the model framework. Extensive experiments over three datasets show that DepBERT is better than various state-of-the art supervised causality extraction methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be released after acceptance.</td>
