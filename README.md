<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the only non-invasive tool for studying white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the brain. These assessments rely heavily on tractography techniques, which reconstruct virtual streamlines representing white matter fibers. Much effort has been devoted to improving tractography methodology for adult brains, while tractography of the fetal brain has been largely neglected. Fetal tractography faces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly developing brain structures, and paucity of reference data. This work presents the first machine learning model for fetal tractography. The model input consists of five sources of information: (1) Fiber orientation, inferred from a diffusion tensor fit to the dMRI signal; (2) Directions of recent propagation steps; (3) Global spatial information, encoded as distances to keypoints in the brain cortex; (4) Tissue segmentation information; and (5) Prior information about the expected local fiber orientations supplied with an atlas. In order to mitigate the local tensor estimation error, a large spatial context around the current point in the diffusion tensor image is encoded using convolutional and attention neural network modules. Moreover, the diffusion tensor information at a hypothetical next point is included in the model input. Filtering rules based on anatomically constrained tractography are applied to prune implausible streamlines. We trained the model on manually-refined whole-brain fetal tractograms and validated the trained model on an independent set of 11 test scans with gestational ages between 23 and 36 weeks. Results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance across all evaluated tracts. The new method can significantly advance the capabilities of dMRI for studying normal and abnormal brain development in utero.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal neuroimaging modeling has becomes a widely used approach but confronts considerable challenges due to heterogeneity, which encompasses variability in data types, scales, and formats across modalities. This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are governed by the brain's structural organization. Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the physical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive. Here, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph C*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying directed network. These equilibrium states, defined from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative contribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome. Using the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, we provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their functional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based on the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model for identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural connectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In existing medical Region of Interest (ROI) detection, there lacks an algorithm that can simultaneously satisfy both real-time performance and accuracy, not meeting the growing demand for automatic detection in medicine. Although the basic YOLO framework ensures real-time detection due to its fast speed, it still faces challenges in maintaining precision concurrently. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel model named Lightweight Shunt Matching-YOLO (LSM-YOLO), with Lightweight Adaptive Extraction (LAE) and Multipath Shunt Feature Matching (MSFM). Firstly, by using LAE to refine feature extraction, the model can obtain more contextual information and high-resolution details from multiscale feature maps, thereby extracting detailed features of ROI in medical images while reducing the influence of noise. Secondly, MSFM is utilized to further refine the fusion of high-level semantic features and low-level visual features, enabling better fusion between ROI features and neighboring features, thereby improving the detection rate for better diagnostic assistance. Experimental results demonstrate that LSM-YOLO achieves 48.6% AP on a private dataset of pancreatic tumors, 65.1% AP on the BCCD blood cell detection public dataset, and 73.0% AP on the Br35h brain tumor detection public dataset. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter cost on the above three datasets. The source codes are at: https://github.com/VincentYuuuuuu/LSM-YOLO.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining popularity in the computational simulation and artificial intelligence fields owing to their biological plausibility and computational efficiency. This paper explores the historical development of SNN and concludes that these two fields are intersecting and merging rapidly. Following the successful application of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS), SNNs have found some proper paradigms, such as continuous visual signal tracking, automatic speech recognition, and reinforcement learning for continuous control, that have extensively supported their key features, including spike encoding, neuronal heterogeneity, specific functional circuits, and multiscale plasticity. Compared to these real-world paradigms, the brain contains a spiking version of the biology-world paradigm, which exhibits a similar level of complexity and is usually considered a mirror of the real world. Considering the projected rapid development of invasive and parallel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as well as the new BCI-based paradigms that include online pattern recognition and stimulus control of biological spike trains, SNNs naturally leverage their advantages in energy efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The biological brain has inspired the present study of SNNs and effective SNN machine-learning algorithms, which can help enhance neuroscience discoveries in the brain by applying them to the new BCI paradigm. Such two-way interactions with positive feedback can accelerate brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence technology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a multi-species partial differential equation (PDE) model for tumor growth and a an algorithm for calibrating the model from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The model is designed for glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors. The modeled species correspond to proliferative, infiltrative, and necrotic tumor cells. The model calibration is formulated as an inverse problem and solved a PDE-constrained optimization method. The data that drives the calibration is derived by a single multi-parametric MRI image. This a typical clinical scenario for GBMs. The unknown parameters that need to be calibrated from data include ten scalar parameters and the infinite dimensional initial condition (IC) for proliferative tumor cells. This inverse problem is highly ill-posed as we try to calibrate a nonlinear dynamical system from data taken at a single time. To address this ill-posedness, we split the inversion into two stages. First we regularize the IC reconstruction by solving a single-species compressed sensing problem. Then, using the IC reconstruction, we invert for model parameters using a weighted regularization term. We construct the regularization term by using auxiliary 1D inverse problems. We apply our proposed scheme to clinical data. We compare our algorithm with single-species reconstruction and unregularized reconstructions. Our scheme enables the stable estimation of non-observable species and quantification of infiltrative tumor cells.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder. Its pathogenesis is not completely clear, making it difficult to treat patients precisely. Because of the complicated non-Euclidean network structure of the human brain, learning critical information from brain networks remains difficult. To effectively capture the topological information of brain neural networks, a novel multimodal graph attention network based on sparse interaction mechanism (Multi-SIGATnet) was proposed for SZ classification was proposed for SZ classification. Firstly, structural and functional information were fused into multimodal data to obtain more comprehensive and abundant features for patients with SZ. Subsequently, a sparse interaction mechanism was proposed to effectively extract salient features and enhance the feature representation capability. By enhancing the strong connections and weakening the weak connections between feature information based on an asymmetric convolutional network, high-order interactive features were captured. Moreover, sparse learning strategies were designed to filter out redundant connections to improve model performance. Finally, local and global features were updated in accordance with the topological features and connection weight constraints of the higher-order brain network, the features being projected to the classification target space for disorder classification. The effectiveness of the model is verified on the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) datasets, achieving 81.9\% and 75.8\% average accuracy, respectively, 4.6\% and 5.5\% higher than the graph attention network (GAT) method. Experiments showed that the Multi-SIGATnet method exhibited good performance in identifying SZ.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is imperative for accurate brain tumor segmentation, offering indispensable complementary information. Nonetheless, the absence of modalities poses significant challenges in achieving precise segmentation. Recognizing the shared anatomical structures between mono-modal and multi-modal representations, it is noteworthy that mono-modal images typically exhibit limited features in specific regions and tissues. In response to this, we present Anatomical Consistency Distillation and Inconsistency Synthesis (ACDIS), a novel framework designed to transfer anatomical structures from multi-modal to mono-modal representations and synthesize modality-specific features. ACDIS consists of two main components: Anatomical Consistency Distillation (ACD) and Modality Feature Synthesis Block (MFSB). ACD incorporates the Anatomical Feature Enhancement Block (AFEB), meticulously mining anatomical information. Simultaneously, Anatomical Consistency ConsTraints (ACCT) are employed to facilitate the consistent knowledge transfer, i.e., the richness of information and the similarity in anatomical structure, ensuring precise alignment of structural features across mono-modality and multi-modality. Complementarily, MFSB produces modality-specific features to rectify anatomical inconsistencies, thereby compensating for missing information in the segmented features. Through validation on the BraTS2018 and BraTS2020 datasets, ACDIS substantiates its efficacy in the segmentation of brain tumors with missing MRI modalities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Driver fatigue detection is increasingly recognized as critical for enhancing road safety. This study introduces a method for detecting driver fatigue using the SEED-VIG dataset, a well-established benchmark in EEG-based vigilance analysis. By employing advanced pattern recognition technologies, including machine learning and deep neural networks, EEG signals are meticulously analyzed to discern patterns indicative of fatigue. This methodology combines feature extraction with a classification framework to improve the accuracy of fatigue detection. The proposed NLMDA-Net reached an impressive accuracy of 83.71% in detecting fatigue from EEG signals by incorporating two novel attention modules designed specifically for EEG signals, the channel and depth attention modules. NLMDA-Net effectively integrate features from multiple dimensions, resulting in improved classification performance. This success stems from integrating temporal convolutions and attention mechanisms, which effectively interpret EEG data. Designed to capture both temporal and spatial characteristics of EEG signals, deep learning classifiers have proven superior to traditional methods. The results of this study reveal a substantial enhancement in detection rates over existing models, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed approach for practical applications. The implications of this research are profound, extending beyond academic realms to inform the development of more sophisticated driver assistance systems. Incorporating this fatigue detection algorithm into these systems could significantly reduce fatigue-related incidents on the road, thus fostering safer driving conditions. This paper provides an exhaustive analysis of the dataset, methods employed, results obtained, and the potential real-world applications of the findings, aiming to contribute significantly to advancements in automotive safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a novel approach to investigate the brain mechanisms that support coordination of behavior between individuals. Brain states in single individuals defined by the patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions are used to create joint symbolic representations of the evolution of brain states in two or more individuals performing a task together. These symbolic dynamics can be analyzed to reveal aspects of the dynamics of joint brain states that are related to coordination or other interactive behaviors. We apply this approach to simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) data from pairs of subjects engaged in two different modes of finger-tapping coordination tasks (synchronization and syncopation) under different interaction conditions (Uncoupled, Leader-Follower, and Mutual) to explore the neural mechanisms of multi-person motor coordination. Our results reveal that the dyads exhibit mostly the same joint symbols in different interaction conditions - the most important differences are reflected in the symbolic dynamics. Recurrence analysis shows that interaction influences the dwell time in specific joint symbols and the structure of joint symbol sequences (motif length). In synchronization, increasing feedback promotes stability with longer dwell times and motif length. In syncopation, Leader-Follower interactions enhance stability (increase dwell time and motif length), but Mutual feedback dramatically reduces stability. Network analysis reveals distinct topological changes with task and feedback. In synchronization, stronger coupling stabilizes a few states restricting the pattern of flow between states, preserving a core-periphery structure of the joint brain states. In syncopation, a more distributed flow amongst a larger set of joint brain states reduces the dominance of core joint brain states.</td>

This study aims to address the challenges of efficiently recording and analyzing high-dimensional EEG signals while listening to music to recognize emotional states. We propose a method combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for EEG signal processing. Using wearable EEG devices, we collected brain activity data from participants listening to music. The data was preprocessed, segmented, and Differential Entropy (DE) features were extracted. We then constructed and trained a Bi-LSTM model to enhance key feature extraction and improve emotion recognition accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the SEED and DEAP datasets. The Bi-LSTM-AttGW model achieved 98.28% accuracy on the SEED dataset and 92.46% on the DEAP dataset in multi-class emotion recognition tasks, significantly outperforming traditional models such as SVM and EEG-Net. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms, providing robust technical support for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and affective computing.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals are widely used in affective brain-computer interface (aBCI) applications. However, not all continuously collected EEG signals are relevant or meaningful to the task at hand (e.g., wondering thoughts). On the other hand, manually labeling the relevant parts is nearly impossible due to varying engagement patterns across different tasks and individuals. Therefore, effectively and efficiently identifying the important parts from continuous EEG recordings is crucial for downstream BCI tasks, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep reinforcement learning framework, called Emotion-Agent, to automatically identify relevant and informative emotional moments from continuous EEG signals. Specifically, Emotion-Agent involves unsupervised deep reinforcement learning combined with a heuristic algorithm. We first use the heuristic algorithm to perform an initial global search and form prototype representations of the EEG signals, which facilitates the efficient exploration of the signal space and identify potential regions of interest. Then, we design distribution-prototype reward functions to estimate the interactions between samples and prototypes, ensuring that the identified parts are both relevant and representative of the underlying emotional states. Emotion-Agent is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve stable and efficient convergence. Our experiments compare the performance with and without Emotion-Agent. The results demonstrate that selecting relevant and informative emotional parts before inputting them into downstream tasks enhances the accuracy and reliability of aBCI applications.</td>

Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. Built upon this idea, we introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models. Our results demonstrate that EEG-Defender is capable of reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by a significant margin, roughly 85\% in comparison with 50\% for the present SOTAs, with minimal impact on the utility and effectiveness of LLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dementia is a neurological syndrome marked by cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Previous studies have utilized various EEG features, such as subband power and connectivity patterns to differentiate these conditions. However, artifacts in EEG signals can obscure crucial information, necessitating advanced signal processing techniques. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. The study utilizes scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to check for the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (comprising AD, FTD, and healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (including subjects with AD, MCI, and HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes on both datasets. The best results were achieved by using a product of probabilities from classifiers for left and right subcortical regions in conjunction with the DenseNet model architecture. It yields accuracies of 94.17$\%$ and 77.72$\%$ on the BrainLat and IITD-AIIA datasets, respectively. This highlights the potential of this approach for early and accurate differentiation of neurodegenerative disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we introduce LightCNN, a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification using EEG data. LightCNN's strength lies in its simplicity, utilizing just a single convolutional layer. Embracing Leonardo da Vinci's principle that "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," LightCNN demonstrates that complexity is not required to achieve outstanding results. We benchmarked LightCNN against several state-of-the-art deep learning models known for their effectiveness in EEG-based PD classification. Remarkably, LightCNN outperformed all these complex architectures, with a 2.3% improvement in recall, a 4.6% increase in precision, a 0.1% edge in AUC, a 4% boost in F1-score, and a 3.3% higher accuracy compared to the closest competitor. Furthermore, LightCNN identifies known pathological brain rhythms associated with PD and effectively captures clinically relevant neurophysiological changes in EEG. Its simplicity and interpretability make it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded systems for EEG analysis. In conclusion, LightCNN represents a significant step forward in efficient EEG-based PD classification, demonstrating that a well-designed, lightweight model can achieve superior performance over more complex architectures. This work underscores the potential for minimalist models to meet the needs of modern healthcare applications, particularly where resources are limited.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining popularity in the computational simulation and artificial intelligence fields owing to their biological plausibility and computational efficiency. This paper explores the historical development of SNN and concludes that these two fields are intersecting and merging rapidly. Following the successful application of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS), SNNs have found some proper paradigms, such as continuous visual signal tracking, automatic speech recognition, and reinforcement learning for continuous control, that have extensively supported their key features, including spike encoding, neuronal heterogeneity, specific functional circuits, and multiscale plasticity. Compared to these real-world paradigms, the brain contains a spiking version of the biology-world paradigm, which exhibits a similar level of complexity and is usually considered a mirror of the real world. Considering the projected rapid development of invasive and parallel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as well as the new BCI-based paradigms that include online pattern recognition and stimulus control of biological spike trains, SNNs naturally leverage their advantages in energy efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The biological brain has inspired the present study of SNNs and effective SNN machine-learning algorithms, which can help enhance neuroscience discoveries in the brain by applying them to the new BCI paradigm. Such two-way interactions with positive feedback can accelerate brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence technology.</td>

This study introduces a customized ConvNeXt architecture, a powerful convolutional neural network, specifically adapted for EEG analysis. ConvNeXt addresses traditional EEG challenges like high dimensionality, noise, and variability, enhancing the precision of mental workload classification. Using the STEW dataset, the proposed ConvNeXt model is evaluated alongside SVM, EEGNet, and TSception on binary (No vs SIMKAP task) and ternary (SIMKAP multitask) class mental workload tasks.

This demonstrates ConvNeXt's resilience and efficiency for EEG data analysis, establishing new standards for mental workload evaluation. These findings represent a considerable advancement in EEG-based mental workload estimation, laying the foundation for future improvements in cognitive state measurements.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are crucial for investigating brain function and cognitive processes. This study aims to address the challenges of efficiently recording and analyzing high-dimensional EEG signals while listening to music to recognize emotional states. We propose a method combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for EEG signal processing. Using wearable EEG devices, we collected brain activity data from participants listening to music. The data was preprocessed, segmented, and Differential Entropy (DE) features were extracted. We then constructed and trained a Bi-LSTM model to enhance key feature extraction and improve emotion recognition accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the SEED and DEAP datasets. The Bi-LSTM-AttGW model achieved 98.28% accuracy on the SEED dataset and 92.46% on the DEAP dataset in multi-class emotion recognition tasks, significantly outperforming traditional models such as SVM and EEG-Net. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Bi-LSTM with attention mechanisms, providing robust technical support for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and affective computing. Future work will focus on improving device design, incorporating multimodal data, and further enhancing emotion recognition accuracy, aiming to achieve practical applications in real-world scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals are widely used in affective brain-computer interface (aBCI) applications. However, not all continuously collected EEG signals are relevant or meaningful to the task at hand (e.g., wondering thoughts). On the other hand, manually labeling the relevant parts is nearly impossible due to varying engagement patterns across different tasks and individuals. Therefore, effectively and efficiently identifying the important parts from continuous EEG recordings is crucial for downstream BCI tasks, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep reinforcement learning framework, called Emotion-Agent, to automatically identify relevant and informative emotional moments from continuous EEG signals. Specifically, Emotion-Agent involves unsupervised deep reinforcement learning combined with a heuristic algorithm. We first use the heuristic algorithm to perform an initial global search and form prototype representations of the EEG signals, which facilitates the efficient exploration of the signal space and identify potential regions of interest. Then, we design distribution-prototype reward functions to estimate the interactions between samples and prototypes, ensuring that the identified parts are both relevant and representative of the underlying emotional states. Emotion-Agent is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve stable and efficient convergence. Our experiments compare the performance with and without Emotion-Agent. The results demonstrate that selecting relevant and informative emotional parts before inputting them into downstream tasks enhances the accuracy and reliability of aBCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Driving under drowsy conditions significantly escalates the risk of vehicular accidents. Although recent efforts have focused on using electroencephalography to detect drowsiness, helping prevent accidents caused by driving in such states, seamless human-machine interaction in driving scenarios requires a more versatile EEG-based system. This system should be capable of understanding a driver's intention while demonstrating resilience to artifacts induced by sudden movements. This paper pioneers a novel research direction in BCI-assisted driving, studying the neural patterns related to driving intentions and presenting a novel method for driving intention prediction. In particular, our preliminary analysis of the EEG signal using independent component analysis suggests a close relation between the intention of driving maneuvers and the neural activities in central-frontal and parietal areas. Power spectral density analysis at a group level also reveals a notable distinction among various driving intentions in the frequency domain. To exploit these brain dynamics, we propose a novel Masked EEG Modeling framework for predicting human driving intentions, including the intention for left turning, right turning, and straight proceeding. Extensive experiments, encompassing comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments on public dataset, demonstrate the proposed method is proficient in predicting driving intentions across various vigilance states. Specifically, our model attains an accuracy of 85.19% when predicting driving intentions for drowsy subjects, which shows its promising potential for mitigating traffic accidents related to drowsy driving. Notably, our method maintains over 75% accuracy when more than half of the channels are missing or corrupted, underscoring its adaptability in real-life driving.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.</td>

We propose an approach that combines emotion recognition methods with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) to integrate emotion inferences from decontextualized facial expressions and contextual knowledge inferred via Large-language Models. We test this approach in the context of interpreting facial expressions during a social task, the prisoner's dilemma. Our results provide clear support for BCI across a range of automatic emotion recognition methods. The best automated method achieved results comparable to human observers, suggesting the potential for this approach to advance the field of affective computing.</td>

While the search for suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last two decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same pace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads. In addition, the full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.</td>

This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</td>

In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture both inter-component and inter-network information. To better handle the FNC data, we develop a new component-specific scanning order. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks.

We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce Scaffold Prompt Tuning (ScaPT), a novel prompt-based framework for adapting large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pre-trained models to downstream tasks, with high parameter efficiency and improved performance compared to fine-tuning and baselines for prompt tuning. The full fine-tuning updates all pre-trained parameters, which may distort the learned feature space and lead to overfitting with limited training data which is common in fMRI fields. In contrast, we design a hierarchical prompt structure that transfers the knowledge learned from high-resource tasks to low-resource ones. This structure, equipped with a Deeply-conditioned Input-Prompt (DIP) mapping module, allows for efficient adaptation by updating only 2% of the trainable parameters. The framework enhances semantic interpretability through attention mechanisms between inputs and prompts, and it clusters prompts in the latent space in alignment with prior knowledge. Experiments on public resting state fMRI datasets reveal ScaPT outperforms fine-tuning and multitask-based prompt tuning in neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis/prognosis and personality trait prediction, even with fewer than 20 participants. It highlights ScaPT's efficiency in adapting pre-trained fMRI models to low-resource tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mammalian functional architecture flexibly adapts, transitioning from integration where information is distributed across the cortex, to segregation where information is focal in densely connected communities of brain regions. This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role.</td>

In this paper, we present a new quantum-based approach named the Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates (HQCG) method for efficient understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum Control Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are designed to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively. Our method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum mechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals, such as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical methods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable and less prone to overfitting than the classical methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a currently incurable neurodegeneartive disease. Accurately detecting AD, especially in the early stage, represents a high research priority. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairments that are related to alterations in brain functional connectivity (FC). Based on this association, many studies have been published over the decades using FC and machine learning to differentiate AD from healthy aging. The most recent development in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network (GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack of spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI. The proposed multi-level generated connectome (MLC) based graph convolutional network (GCN) (MLC-GCN) contains a multi-graph generation block and a GCN prediction block. The multi-graph generation block consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature extraction layers for extracting spatio-temporal rsfMRI features at different depths and building the corresponding connectomes. The GCN prediction block takes the learned multi-level connectomes to build and optimize GCNs at each level and concatenates the learned graphical features as the final predicting features for AD classification. Through independent cohort validations, MLC-GCN shows better performance for differentiating MCI, AD, and normal aging than state-of-art GCN and rsfMRI based AD classifiers. The proposed MLC-GCN also showed high explainability in terms of learning clinically reasonable connectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets. While we only tested MLC-GCN on AD, the basic rsfMRI-based multi-level learned GCN based outcome prediction strategy is valid for other diseases or clinical outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research, accurately predicting imagined stimuli is crucial. This study investigates the effectiveness of Domain Adaptation (DA) in enhancing imagery prediction using primarily visual data from fMRI scans of 18 subjects. Initially, we train a baseline model on visual stimuli to predict imagined stimuli, utilizing data from 14 brain regions. We then develop several models to improve imagery prediction, comparing different DA methods. Our results demonstrate that DA significantly enhances imagery prediction, especially with the Regular Transfer approach. We then conduct a DA-enhanced searchlight analysis using Regular Transfer, followed by permutation-based statistical tests to identify brain regions where imagery decoding is consistently above chance across subjects. Our DA-enhanced searchlight predicts imagery contents in a highly distributed set of brain regions, including the visual cortex and the frontoparietal cortex, thereby outperforming standard cross-domain classification methods. The complete code and data for this paper have been made openly available for the use of the scientific community.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</td>

This study utilized bibliometric methods to explore and analyze the progress, hotspots and developmental trends in international MEG research spanning from 1995 to 2022. The results indicated a dynamic and steady growth trend in the overall number of publications in MEG. Ryusuke Kakigi emerged as the most prolific author, while Neuroimage led as the most prolific journal. Current hotspots in MEG research encompass resting state, networks, functional connectivity, phase dynamics, oscillation, and more. Future trends in MEG research are poised to advance across three key aspects: disease treatment and practical applications, experimental foundations and technical advancements, and fundamental and advanced human cognition. In the future, there should be a focus on enhancing cross-integration and utilization of MEG with other instruments to diversify research methodologies in this field</td>

Utilizing stacked \Chandra/\ACISS\ \MEG\ and \LETG\ spectra toward QSO sightlines, we employ the self-consistent hybrid ionization code PHASE to model our data. The stacked spectra are optimally described by three distinct gas phase components: a \warm\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 5.5), \warmhot\ (\logT\ $\sim 6$), and \hot\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 7.5) components. These findings confirm the presence of the \hot\ component in the MW's CGM indicating its coexistence with a \warm\ and a \warmhot\ gas phases. We find this \hot\ component to be homogeneous in temperature but inhomogeneous in column density. The gas in the \hot\ component requires over-abundances relative to solar to be consistent with the Dispersion Measure (DM) from the Galactic halo reported in the literature. {For the hot phase we estimated a DM = $55.1^{+29.9}_{-23.7}$ pc cm$^{-3}$}. We conclude that this phase is either enriched in Oxygen, Silicon, and Sulfur, or has metallicity {over 6} times solar value, or a combination of both. We do not detect Fe L-shell absorption lines, implying O/Fe $\geq$ 4. The non-solar abundance ratios found in the super-virial gas component in the Galactic halo suggest that this phase arises from Galactic feedback.</td>

In this study, we studied non-local CW for the fermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\left| q \right| > 1$ constraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Higher-order properties of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) induced connectivity have been shown to unravel many exclusive topological and dynamical insights beyond pairwise interactions. Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.</td>

First, an MEG-DT architecture is put forward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto edge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low latency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Plasmonic near-field transducers (NFTs) play a key role in administering nanoscale heating for a number of applications ranging from medical devices to next generation data processing technology. We present a novel multi-scale approach, combining quantum many-body perturbation theory with finite-element modelling, to predict the electric and thermal material parameters of various Au-based, noble metal (M) alloys. Specifically, we focus on modelling their performance within an NFT designed to focus high-intensity, sub-diffracted light for technologies such as nanoscale etching, manipulation, sensing, and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). Elemental Au is the long-standing general-purpose NFT medium due its excellent plasmonic performance at relevant wavelengths. However, elemental Au is a soft, ductile material that tends to extrude and deform in response to extreme temperature gradients. Therefore, alloying Au with other noble metals such as Ag, Cu, Pd or Pt, has attracted considerable interest for improved mechanical and thermal robustness while reaching threshold plasmonic generation at standard optoelectronics operating wavelengths (e.g., $\approx 830$~nm) and approximate high-power NFT temperatures ($\approx 400$~K). We predict that certain Au-Ag alloys may offer improved thermal stability as whole-NFT media compared to elemental Au, alongside plasmonic figures of merit comparable to that of Au. Simulations of certain solid solution Au-Pd/Pt alloys enable us to predict significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. We predict that alloying with Pd at low concentrations $\sim 10\%$ may preserve the NFT performance of Au, while offering the benefits of improved thermal and mechanical stability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Conventional 3D medical image segmentation methods typically require learning heavy 3D networks (e.g., 3D-UNet), as well as large amounts of in-domain data with accurate pixel/voxel-level labels to avoid overfitting. These solutions are thus extremely time- and labor-expensive, but also may easily fail to generalize to unseen objects during training. To alleviate this issue, we present MSFSeg, a novel few-shot 3D segmentation framework with a lightweight multi-surrogate fusion (MSF). MSFSeg is able to automatically segment unseen 3D objects/organs (during training) provided with one or a few annotated 2D slices or 3D sequence segments, via learning dense query-support organ/lesion anatomy correlations across patient populations. Our proposed MSF module mines comprehensive and diversified morphology correlations between unlabeled and the few labeled slices/sequences through multiple designated surrogates, making it able to generate accurate cross-domain 3D segmentation masks given annotated slices or sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by showing superior performance on conventional few-shot segmentation benchmarks compared to prior art, and remarkable cross-domain cross-volume segmentation performance on proprietary 3D segmentation datasets for challenging entities, i.e., tubular structures, with only limited 2D or 3D labels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are pivotal in transcribing speech into text, yet the errors they introduce can significantly degrade the performance of downstream tasks like summarization. This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical dialogue summarization, a low-resource domain where supervised data for fine-tuning is scarce, necessitating the use of ASR models as black-box solutions. Employing conventional data augmentation for enhancing the noise robustness of summarization models is not feasible either due to the unavailability of sufficient medical dialogue audio recordings and corresponding ASR transcripts. To address this challenge, we propose MEDSAGE, an approach for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation using Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we leverage the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on a few available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. Experimental results show that LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, and incorporating this noisy data into the training process significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems. This approach addresses the challenges of noisy ASR outputs in critical applications, offering a robust solution to enhance the reliability of clinical dialogue summarization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM), has recently shown competitive performance to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers in Natural Language Processing and general sequence modeling. Various attempts have been made to adapt Mamba to Computer Vision tasks, including medical image segmentation (MIS). Vision Mamba (VM)-based networks are particularly attractive due to their ability to achieve global receptive fields, similar to Vision Transformers, while also maintaining linear complexity in the number of tokens. However, the existing VM models still struggle to maintain both spatially local and global dependencies of tokens in high dimensional arrays due to their sequential nature. Employing multiple and/or complicated scanning strategies is computationally costly, which hinders applications of SSMs to high-dimensional 2D and 3D images that are common in MIS problems. In this work, we propose Local-Global Vision Mamba, LoG-VMamba, that explicitly enforces spatially adjacent tokens to remain nearby on the channel axis, and retains the global context in a compressed form. Our method allows the SSMs to access the local and global contexts even before reaching the last token while requiring only a simple scanning strategy. Our segmentation models are computationally efficient and substantially outperform both CNN and Transformers-based baselines on a diverse set of 2D and 3D MIS tasks. The implementation of LoG-VMamba is available at \url{https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/LoG-VMamba}.</td>

This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Uncertainty quantification is a key pillar of trustworthy machine learning. It enables safe reactions under unsafe inputs, like predicting only when the machine learning model detects sufficient evidence, discarding anomalous data, or emitting warnings when an error is likely to be inbound. This is particularly crucial in safety-critical areas like medical image classification or self-driving cars. Despite the plethora of proposed uncertainty quantification methods achieving increasingly higher scores on performance benchmarks, uncertainty estimates are often shied away from in practice. Many machine learning projects start from pretrained latent representations that come without uncertainty estimates. Uncertainties would need to be trained by practitioners on their own, which is notoriously difficult and resource-intense.   This thesis makes uncertainty estimates easily accessible by adding them to the latent representation vectors of pretrained computer vision models. Besides proposing approaches rooted in probability and decision theory, such as Monte-Carlo InfoNCE (MCInfoNCE) and loss prediction, we delve into both theoretical and empirical questions. We show that these unobservable uncertainties about unobservable latent representations are indeed provably correct. We also provide an uncertainty-aware representation learning (URL) benchmark to compare these unobservables against observable ground-truths. Finally, we compile our findings to pretrain lightweight representation uncertainties on large-scale computer vision models that transfer to unseen datasets in a zero-shot manner.   Our findings do not only advance the current theoretical understanding of uncertainties over latent variables, but also facilitate the access to uncertainty quantification for future researchers inside and outside the field, enabling straightforward but trustworthy machine learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The current mainstream multi-modal medical image-to-image translation methods face a contradiction. Supervised methods with outstanding performance rely on pixel-wise aligned training data to constrain the model optimization. However, obtaining pixel-wise aligned multi-modal medical image datasets is challenging. Unsupervised methods can be trained without paired data, but their reliability cannot be guaranteed. At present, there is no ideal multi-modal medical image-to-image translation method that can generate reliable translation results without the need for pixel-wise aligned data. This work aims to develop a novel medical image-to-image translation model that is independent of pixel-wise aligned data (MITIA), enabling reliable multi-modal medical image-to-image translation under the condition of misaligned training data. The proposed MITIA model utilizes a prior extraction network composed of a multi-modal medical image registration module and a multi-modal misalignment error detection module to extract pixel-level prior information from training data with misalignment errors to the largest extent. The extracted prior information is then used to construct a regularization term to constrain the optimization of the unsupervised cycle-consistent GAN model, restricting its solution space and thereby improving the performance and reliability of the generator. We trained the MITIA model using six datasets containing different misalignment errors and two well-aligned datasets. Subsequently, we compared the proposed method with six other state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods. The results of both quantitative analysis and qualitative visual inspection indicate that MITIA achieves superior performance compared to the competing state-of-the-art methods, both on misaligned data and aligned data.</td>

However, ViTs demand a large amount of data to achieve adequate performance, which makes their application to small datasets challenging, falling behind CNNs. To overcome this, we propose GenFormer, a data augmentation strategy utilizing generated images, thereby improving transformer accuracy and robustness on small-scale image classification tasks. In our comprehensive evaluation we propose Tiny ImageNetV2, -R, and -A as new test set variants of Tiny ImageNet by transferring established ImageNet generalization and robustness benchmarks to the small-scale data domain. Similarly, we introduce MedMNIST-C and EuroSAT-C as corrupted test set variants of established fine-grained datasets in the medical and aerial domain. Through a series of experiments conducted on small datasets of various domains, including Tiny ImageNet, CIFAR, EuroSAT and MedMNIST datasets, we demonstrate the synergistic power of our method, in particular when combined with common train and test time augmentations, knowledge distillation, and architectural design choices. Additionally, we prove the effectiveness of our approach under challenging conditions with limited training data, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, bridging the gap between CNNs and ViTs in the small-scale dataset domain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electron microscopy (EM) imaging offers unparalleled resolution for analyzing neural tissues, crucial for uncovering the intricacies of synaptic connections and neural processes fundamental to understanding behavioral mechanisms. Recently, the foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural and medical image segmentation tasks. However, applying these foundation models to EM segmentation faces significant challenges due to domain disparities. This paper presents ShapeMamba-EM, a specialized fine-tuning method for 3D EM segmentation, which employs adapters for long-range dependency modeling and an encoder for local shape description within the original foundation model. This approach effectively addresses the unique volumetric and morphological complexities of EM data. Tested over a wide range of EM images, covering five segmentation tasks and 10 datasets, ShapeMamba-EM outperforms existing methods, establishing a new standard in EM image segmentation and enhancing the understanding of neural tissue architecture.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In existing medical Region of Interest (ROI) detection, there lacks an algorithm that can simultaneously satisfy both real-time performance and accuracy, not meeting the growing demand for automatic detection in medicine. Although the basic YOLO framework ensures real-time detection due to its fast speed, it still faces challenges in maintaining precision concurrently. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel model named Lightweight Shunt Matching-YOLO (LSM-YOLO), with Lightweight Adaptive Extraction (LAE) and Multipath Shunt Feature Matching (MSFM). Firstly, by using LAE to refine feature extraction, the model can obtain more contextual information and high-resolution details from multiscale feature maps, thereby extracting detailed features of ROI in medical images while reducing the influence of noise. Secondly, MSFM is utilized to further refine the fusion of high-level semantic features and low-level visual features, enabling better fusion between ROI features and neighboring features, thereby improving the detection rate for better diagnostic assistance. Experimental results demonstrate that LSM-YOLO achieves 48.6% AP on a private dataset of pancreatic tumors, 65.1% AP on the BCCD blood cell detection public dataset, and 73.0% AP on the Br35h brain tumor detection public dataset. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter cost on the above three datasets. The source codes are at: https://github.com/VincentYuuuuuu/LSM-YOLO.</td>
