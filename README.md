<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current leading theories of physics such as the Big Bang, the standard model of particle physics, and general relativity suggest that the universe should contain an equal amount of matter and antimatter. Yet observations have found a disproportionately large amount of matter, a phenomenon known as the baryon assymmetry problem. Since century-old established theories are traditionally impossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining antimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the existence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable Antimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a framework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists, and thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy. Our method is the firing of neurons in our brains, typically known as a thought experiment. We still have no idea why or how this works, but it must be good because most of science was created this way. Our results are the result of our methods, which result in some text and the resulting conclusions. In order to encourage the reader to reach the end of this short paper, we do not want to spoil the conclusions here. Instead, the conclusions will conclude the paper.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory of information processing in the brain, providing a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. It is motivated in terms of Bayesian inference, as hidden states and parameters are optimised via gradient descent on variational free energy. However, implementations of PC rely on maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimates of hidden states and maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters, limiting their ability to quantify epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we investigate a Bayesian extension to PC that estimates a posterior distribution over network parameters. This approach, termed Bayesian Predictive coding (BPC), preserves the locality of PC and results in closed-form Hebbian weight updates. Compared to PC, our BPC algorithm converges in fewer epochs in the full-batch setting and remains competitive in the mini-batch setting. Additionally, we demonstrate that BPC offers uncertainty quantification comparable to existing methods in Bayesian deep learning, while also improving convergence properties. Together, these results suggest that BPC provides a biologically plausible method for Bayesian learning in the brain, as well as an attractive approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The correlation matrix is a central representation of functional brain networks in neuroimaging. Traditional analyses often treat pairwise interactions independently in a Euclidean setting, overlooking the intrinsic geometry of correlation matrices. While earlier attempts have embraced the quotient geometry of the correlation manifold, they remain limited by computational inefficiency and numerical instability, particularly in high-dimensional contexts. This paper presents a novel geometric framework that employs diffeomorphic transformations to embed correlation matrices into a Euclidean space, preserving salient manifold properties and enabling large-scale analyses. The proposed method integrates with established learning algorithms - regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering - and extends naturally to population-level inference of brain networks. Simulation studies demonstrate both improved computational speed and enhanced accuracy compared to conventional manifold-based approaches. Moreover, applications in real neuroimaging scenarios illustrate the framework's utility, enhancing behavior score prediction, subject fingerprinting in resting-state fMRI, and hypothesis testing in electroencephalogram data. An open-source MATLAB toolbox is provided to facilitate broader adoption and advance the application of correlation geometry in functional brain network research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We model human and animal learning by computing with high-dimensional vectors (H = 10,000 for example). The architecture resembles traditional (von Neumann) computing with numbers, but the instructions refer to vectors and operate on them in superposition. The architecture includes a high-capacity memory for vectors, analogue of the random-access memory (RAM) for numbers. The model's ability to learn from data reminds us of deep learning, but with an architecture closer to biology. The architecture agrees with an idea from psychology that human memory and learning involve a short-term working memory and a long-term data store. Neuroscience provides us with a model of the long-term memory, namely, the cortex of the cerebellum. With roots in psychology, biology, and traditional computing, a theory of computing with vectors can help us understand how brains compute. Application to learning by robots seems inevitable, but there is likely to be more, including language. Ultimately we want to compute with no more material and energy than used by brains. To that end, we need a mathematical theory that agrees with psychology and biology, and is suitable for nanotechnology. We also need to exercise the theory in large-scale experiments. Computing with vectors is described here in terms familiar to us from traditional computing with numbers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain's complex nonlinear dynamics give rise to adaptive cognition and behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. These dynamics exhibit scale-free and multifractal properties, influencing the reconfiguration of neural networks. However, conventional neuroimaging models are constrained by linear and stationary assumptions, limiting their ability to capture these processes. Transformer-based architectures, known for capturing long-range dependencies, align well with the brain's hierarchical and temporal organization. We introduce Multi-Band Brain Net (MBBN), a transformer-based framework that models frequency-specific spatiotemporal brain dynamics from fMRI by integrating scale-free network principles with frequency-resolved multi-band self-attention. Trained on three large-scale neuroimaging cohorts (UK Biobank, ABCD, ABIDE) totaling 45,951 individuals, MBBN reveals previously undetectable frequency-dependent network interactions, shedding light on connectivity disruptions in psychiatric conditions (ADHD, ASD, depression). This validation shows robust generalizability and highlights core neural principles conserved across populations. MBBN achieves up to 30.59% higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the advantage of frequency-informed spatiotemporal modeling in capturing latent neural computations. MBBN's interpretability uncovers novel frequency-specific biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders, providing insights into the hierarchical organization of brain function. By offering an interpretable framework for spatiotemporal learning, MBBN provides insights into how neural computations underpin cognitive function and psychiatric vulnerability, with implications for brain decoding, cognitive neuroscience, and precision psychiatry.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-human primates (NHPs) serve as critical models for understanding human brain function and neurological disorders due to their close evolutionary relationship with humans. Accurate brain tissue segmentation in NHPs is critical for understanding neurological disorders, but challenging due to the scarcity of annotated NHP brain MRI datasets, the small size of the NHP brain, the limited resolution of available imaging data and the anatomical differences between human and NHP brains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing STU-Net with transfer learning to leverage knowledge transferred from human brain MRI data to enhance segmentation accuracy in the NHP brain MRI, particularly when training data is limited. The combination of STU-Net and transfer learning effectively delineates complex tissue boundaries and captures fine anatomical details specific to NHP brains. Notably, our method demonstrated improvement in segmenting small subcortical structures such as putamen and thalamus that are challenging to resolve with limited spatial resolution and tissue contrast, and achieved DSC of over 0.88, IoU over 0.8 and HD95 under 7. This study introduces a robust method for multi-class brain tissue segmentation in NHPs, potentially accelerating research in evolutionary neuroscience and preclinical studies of neurological disorders relevant to human health.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To evaluate a Deep-Learning-enhanced MUlti-PArametric MR sequence (DL-MUPA) for treatment response assessment for brain metastases patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and head-and-neck (HnN) cancer patients undergoing conventionally fractionation adaptive radiation therapy. Methods: DL-MUPA derives quantitative T1 and T2 maps from a single 4-6-minute scan denoised via DL method using dictionary fitting. Phantom benchmarking was performed on a NIST-ISMRM phantom. Longitudinal patient data were acquired on a 1.5T MR-simulator, including pre-treatment (PreTx) and every 3 months after SRS (PostTx) in brain, and PreTx, mid-treatment and 3 months PostTx in HnN. Changes of mean T1 and T2 values were calculated within gross tumor volumes (GTVs), residual disease (RD, HnN), parotids, and submandibular glands (HnN) for treatment response assessment. Uninvolved normal tissues (normal appearing white matter in brain, masseter in HnN) were evaluated to as control. Results: Phantom benchmarking showed excellent inter-session repeatability (coefficient of variance <1% for T1, <7% for T2). Uninvolved normal tissue suggested acceptable in-vivo repeatability (brain |$\Delta$|<5%, HnN |$\Delta$T1|<7%, |$\Delta$T2|<18% (4ms)). Remarkable changes were noted in resolved brain metastasis ($\Delta$T1=14%) and necrotic settings ($\Delta$T1=18-40%, $\Delta$T2=9-41%). In HnN, two primary tumors showed T2 increase (PostTx GTV $\Delta$T2>13%, RD $\Delta$T2>18%). A nodal disease resolved PostTx (GTV $\Delta$T1=-40%, $\Delta$T2=-33%, RD $\Delta$T1=-29%, $\Delta$T2=-35%). Enhancement was found in involved parotids (PostTx $\Delta$T1>12%, $\Delta$T2>13%) and submandibular glands (PostTx $\Delta$T1>15%, $\Delta$T2>35%) while the uninvolved organs remained stable. Conclusions: DL-MUPA shows promise for treatment response assessment and identifying potential endpoints for functional sparing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain vessel segmentation of MR scans is a critical step in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the fine vessel structure, manual vessel segmentation is time consuming. Therefore, automatic deep learning (DL) based segmentation techniques are intensively investigated. As conventional DL models yield a high complexity and lack an indication of decision reliability, they are often considered as not trustworthy. This work aims to increase trust in DL based models by incorporating epistemic uncertainty quantification into cerebrovascular segmentation models for the first time. By implementing an efficient ensemble model combining the advantages of Bayesian Approximation and Deep Ensembles, we aim to overcome the high computational costs of conventional probabilistic networks. Areas of high model uncertainty and erroneous predictions are aligned which demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the approach. We perform extensive experiments applying the ensemble model on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We demonstrate that for OOD-images, the estimated uncertainty increases. Additionally, omitting highly uncertain areas improves the segmentation quality, both for in- and out-of-distribution data. The ensemble model explains its limitations in a reliable manner and can maintain trustworthiness also for OOD data and could be considered in clinical applications</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity data with phenotypic textual descriptors (e.g., disease label, demographic data) holds significant potential to advance our understanding of neurological conditions. However, existing cross-modal alignment methods often lack interpretability and risk introducing biases by encoding sensitive attributes together with diagnostic-related features. In this work, we propose NeuroLIP, a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework. We introduce text token-conditioned attention (TTCA) and cross-modal alignment via localized tokens (CALT) to the brain region-level embeddings with each disease-related phenotypic token. It improves interpretability via token-level attention maps, revealing brain region-disease associations. To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance. Qualitative visualization of attention maps highlights neuroanatomical patterns aligned with diagnostic characteristics, validated by the neuroscientific literature. Our work advances the development of transparent and equitable neuroimaging AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, which can have severe long-term consequences if undetected and left untreated. Early detection is crucial and typically requires continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring in a hospital setting, which is costly, inconvenient, and requires specialized experts for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a new low-cost active dry-contact electrode-based adjustable EEG headset, a new explainable deep learning model to detect neonatal seizures, and an advanced signal processing algorithm to remove artifacts to address the key aspects that lead to the underdiagnosis of neonatal seizures. Methods: EEG signals are acquired through active electrodes and processed using a custom-designed analog front end (AFE) that filters and digitizes the captured EEG signals. The adjustable headset is designed using three-dimensional (3D) printing and laser cutting to fit a wide range of head sizes. A deep learning model is developed to classify seizure and non-seizure epochs in real-time. Furthermore, a separate multimodal deep learning model is designed to remove noise artifacts. The device is tested on a pediatric patient with absence seizures in a hospital setting. Simultaneous recordings are captured using both the custom device and the commercial wet electrode device available in the hospital for comparison. Results: The signals obtained using our custom design and a commercial device show a high correlation (>0.8). Further analysis using signal-to-noise ratio values shows that our device can mitigate noise similar to the commercial device. The proposed deep learning model has improvements in accuracy and recall by 2.76% and 16.33%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the developed artifact removal algorithm can identify and remove artifacts while keeping seizure patterns intact.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper addresses the problem of detecting change points in the spectral density of time series, motivated by EEG analysis of seizure patients. Seizures disrupt coherence and functional connectivity, necessitating precise detection. Departing from traditional parametric approaches, we utilize the Wold decomposition, representing general time series as autoregressive processes with infinite lags, which are truncated and estimated around the change point. Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals. The proposed method effectively identifies seizure onset in EEG data and extends to event detection in video data. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing techniques.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Virtual reality (VR) presents immersive opportunities across many applications, yet the inherent risk of developing cybersickness during interaction can severely reduce enjoyment and platform adoption. Cybersickness is marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work primarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and motion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the \emph{dynamic nature} of cybersickness while users experience and freely interact in VR. We propose a novel method to \emph{continuously} identify and quantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users' \emph{passively monitored} electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method estimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing techniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels in real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific calibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses the considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing challenge due to its increasing prevalence, complex pathology, and functional ramifications. Electroencephalography (EEG), when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), holds promise for monitoring disease progression, identifying sub-phenotypes, and personalizing treatment strategies. However, the effect of medication state on AI model learning and generalization remains poorly understood, potentially limiting EEG-based AI models clinical applicability. This study evaluates how medication state influences the training and generalization of EEG-based AI models. Paired EEG recordings were utilized from individuals with PD in both ON- and OFF-medication states. AI models were trained on recordings from each state separately and evaluated on independent test sets representing both ON- and OFF-medication conditions. Model performance was assessed using multiple metrics, with accuracy (ACC) as the primary outcome. Statistical significance was assessed via permutation testing (p-values<0.05). Our results reveal that models trained on OFF-medication data exhibited consistent but suboptimal performance across both medication states (ACC_OFF-ON=55.3\pm8.8 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\pm8.7). In contrast, models trained on ON-medication data demonstrated significantly higher performance on ON-medication recordings (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\pm7.1) but significantly reduced generalization to OFF-medication data (ACC_ON-OFF=76.0\pm7.2). Notably, models trained on ON-medication data consistently outperformed those trained on OFF-medication data within their respective states (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\pm7.1 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\pm8.7). Our findings suggest that medication state significantly influences the patterns learned by AI models. Addressing this challenge is essential to enhance the robustness and clinical utility of AI models for PD characterization and management.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spectrograms are pivotal in time-frequency signal analysis, widely used in audio processing and computational neuroscience. Chirp-like patterns in electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrograms (marked by linear or exponential frequency sweep) are key biomarkers for seizure dynamics, but automated tools for their detection, localization, and feature extraction are lacking. This study bridges this gap by fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on synthetic spectrograms, augmented with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to boost adaptability. We generated 100000 synthetic spectrograms with chirp parameters, creating the first large-scale benchmark for chirp localization. These spectrograms mimic neural chirps using linear or exponential frequency sweep, Gaussian noise, and smoothing. A ViT model, adapted for regression, predicted chirp parameters. LoRA fine-tuned the attention layers, enabling efficient updates to the pre-trained backbone. Training used MSE loss and the AdamW optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler and early stopping to curb overfitting. Only three features were targeted: Chirp Start Time (Onset Time), Chirp Start Frequency (Onset Frequency), and Chirp End Frequency (Offset Frequency). Performance was evaluated via Pearson correlation between predicted and actual labels. Results showed strong alignment: 0.9841 correlation for chirp start time, with stable inference times (137 to 140s) and minimal bias in error distributions. This approach offers a tool for chirp analysis in EEG time-frequency representation, filling a critical methodological void.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject EEG emotion recognition is challenged by significant inter-subject variability and intricately entangled intra-subject variability. Existing works have primarily addressed these challenges through domain adaptation or generalization strategies. However, they typically require extensive target subject data or demonstrate limited generalization performance to unseen subjects. Recent few-shot learning paradigms attempt to address these limitations but often encounter catastrophic overfitting during subject-specific adaptation with limited samples. This article introduces the few-shot adapter with a cross-view fusion method called FACE for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition, which leverages dynamic multi-view fusion and effective subject-specific adaptation. Specifically, FACE incorporates a cross-view fusion module that dynamically integrates global brain connectivity with localized patterns via subject-specific fusion weights to provide complementary emotional information. Moreover, the few-shot adapter module is proposed to enable rapid adaptation for unseen subjects while reducing overfitting by enhancing adapter structures with meta-learning. Experimental results on three public EEG emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate FACE's superior generalization performance over state-of-the-art methods. FACE provides a practical solution for cross-subject scenarios with limited labeled data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the rapid advancement of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, the volume of physiological data generated in related research and applications has grown significantly. Data is a critical resource in BCI research and a key factor in the development of BCI technology, making efficient storage and management of this data increasingly vital. In the realm of research, ample data can facilitate the development of novel algorithms, which can be more accurately validated. In terms of applications, well-organized data can foster the emergence of new business opportunities, thereby maximizing the commercial value of the data. Currently, there are two major challenges in the storage and management of BCI data: providing different classification storage modes for multi-modal data, and adapting to varying application scenarios while improving storage strategies. To address these challenges, this study has developed the NeuroStore BCI data persistence system, which provides a general and easily scalable data model and can effectively handle multiple types of data storage. The system has a flexible distributed framework and can be widely applied to various scenarios. It has been utilized as the core support platform for efficient data storage and management services in the "BCI Controlled Robot Contest in World Robot Contest."</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Patients with extreme forms of paralysis face challenges in communication, adversely impacting their quality of life. Recent studies have reported higher-than-chance performance in decoding handwritten letters from EEG signals, potentially allowing these subjects to communicate. However, all prior works have attempted to decode handwriting from EEG during actual motion. Furthermore, they assume that precise movement-onset is known. In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The large volume of electroencephalograph (EEG) data produced by brain-computer interface (BCI) systems presents challenges for rapid transmission over bandwidth-limited channels in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems traditionally used in medicine and designed to interact with the brain to record or stimulate neurons. Despite their benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on neurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In this context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt spontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition. Previous work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced number of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this limitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of the primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons, tested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting gratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus, also testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results, based on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the attacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and fixed events are the most robust. Although both attacks can significantly affect neural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal delays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many neurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO increased with the number of neurons attacked.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The emergence of vision-language-action (VLA) models has given rise to foundation models for robot manipulation. Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</td>

This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative communication methods for individuals with motor disabilities by allowing control and interaction with external devices. Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The correlation matrix is a central representation of functional brain networks in neuroimaging. Traditional analyses often treat pairwise interactions independently in a Euclidean setting, overlooking the intrinsic geometry of correlation matrices. While earlier attempts have embraced the quotient geometry of the correlation manifold, they remain limited by computational inefficiency and numerical instability, particularly in high-dimensional contexts. This paper presents a novel geometric framework that employs diffeomorphic transformations to embed correlation matrices into a Euclidean space, preserving salient manifold properties and enabling large-scale analyses. The proposed method integrates with established learning algorithms - regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering - and extends naturally to population-level inference of brain networks. Simulation studies demonstrate both improved computational speed and enhanced accuracy compared to conventional manifold-based approaches. Moreover, applications in real neuroimaging scenarios illustrate the framework's utility, enhancing behavior score prediction, subject fingerprinting in resting-state fMRI, and hypothesis testing in electroencephalogram data. An open-source MATLAB toolbox is provided to facilitate broader adoption and advance the application of correlation geometry in functional brain network research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain's complex nonlinear dynamics give rise to adaptive cognition and behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. These dynamics exhibit scale-free and multifractal properties, influencing the reconfiguration of neural networks. However, conventional neuroimaging models are constrained by linear and stationary assumptions, limiting their ability to capture these processes. Transformer-based architectures, known for capturing long-range dependencies, align well with the brain's hierarchical and temporal organization. We introduce Multi-Band Brain Net (MBBN), a transformer-based framework that models frequency-specific spatiotemporal brain dynamics from fMRI by integrating scale-free network principles with frequency-resolved multi-band self-attention. Trained on three large-scale neuroimaging cohorts (UK Biobank, ABCD, ABIDE) totaling 45,951 individuals, MBBN reveals previously undetectable frequency-dependent network interactions, shedding light on connectivity disruptions in psychiatric conditions (ADHD, ASD, depression). This validation shows robust generalizability and highlights core neural principles conserved across populations. MBBN achieves up to 30.59% higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the advantage of frequency-informed spatiotemporal modeling in capturing latent neural computations. MBBN's interpretability uncovers novel frequency-specific biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders, providing insights into the hierarchical organization of brain function. By offering an interpretable framework for spatiotemporal learning, MBBN provides insights into how neural computations underpin cognitive function and psychiatric vulnerability, with implications for brain decoding, cognitive neuroscience, and precision psychiatry.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity data with phenotypic textual descriptors (e.g., disease label, demographic data) holds significant potential to advance our understanding of neurological conditions. However, existing cross-modal alignment methods often lack interpretability and risk introducing biases by encoding sensitive attributes together with diagnostic-related features. In this work, we propose NeuroLIP, a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework. We introduce text token-conditioned attention (TTCA) and cross-modal alignment via localized tokens (CALT) to the brain region-level embeddings with each disease-related phenotypic token. It improves interpretability via token-level attention maps, revealing brain region-disease associations. To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance. Qualitative visualization of attention maps highlights neuroanatomical patterns aligned with diagnostic characteristics, validated by the neuroscientific literature. Our work advances the development of transparent and equitable neuroimaging AI.</td>

Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training without direct data sharing. Model-heterogeneous FL (MHFL) extends this paradigm by allowing clients to train personalized models with heterogeneous architectures tailored to their computational resources and application-specific needs. However, existing MHFL methods predominantly rely on centralized aggregation, which introduces scalability and efficiency bottlenecks, or impose restrictions requiring partially identical model architectures across clients. While peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes server dependence, it suffers from model drift and knowledge dilution, limiting its effectiveness in heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedSKD, a novel MHFL framework that facilitates direct knowledge exchange through round-robin model circulation, eliminating the need for centralized aggregation while allowing fully heterogeneous model architectures across clients. FedSKD's key innovation lies in multi-dimensional similarity knowledge distillation, which enables bidirectional cross-client knowledge transfer at batch, pixel/voxel, and region levels for heterogeneous models in FL. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and model drift through progressive reinforcement and distribution alignment while preserving model heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on fMRI-based autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and skin lesion classification demonstrate that FedSKD outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous FL baselines, achieving superior personalization (client-specific accuracy) and generalization (cross-institutional adaptability). These findings underscore FedSKD's potential as a scalable and robust solution for real-world medical federated learning applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In daily life, we encounter diverse external stimuli, such as images, sounds, and videos. As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness. Finally, it identifies key challenges and proposes future research directions, offering valuable insights for the field.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The world of beauty is deeply connected to the visual cortex, as perception often begins with vision in both humans and marmosets. Quantifying functional correspondences in the visual cortex across species can help us understand how information is processed in the primate visual cortex, while also providing deeper insights into human visual cortex functions through the study of marmosets. In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.</td>

We propose a new pipeline to generate synthetic data and to benchmark the state of the art in graph inference. Simulated correlation matrices are designed to have a set of given zeros and a constraint on the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare approaches based on covariance or precision matrices, emphasizing their implications for connectivity inference. This framework allows us to assess the sensitivity of connectivity estimations and edge detection methods to different parameters.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the organization of human brain networks has become a central focus in neuroscience, particularly in the study of functional connectivity, which plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques have significantly improved brain network analysis. However, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex relationships between brain regions, while deep learning methods, particularly Transformer-based models, face computational challenges due to their quadratic complexity in long-sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Core-Periphery State-Space Model (CP-SSM), an innovative framework for functional connectome classification. Specifically, we introduce Mamba, a selective state-space model with linear complexity, to effectively capture long-range dependencies in functional brain networks. Furthermore, inspired by the core-periphery (CP) organization, a fundamental characteristic of brain networks that enhances efficient information transmission, we design CP-MoE, a CP-guided Mixture-of-Experts that improves the representation learning of brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate CP-SSM on two benchmark fMRI datasets: ABIDE and ADNI. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-SSM surpasses Transformer-based models in classification performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-SSM in modeling brain functional connectivity, offering a promising direction for neuroimaging-based neurological disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of human and artificial intelligence represents a scientific opportunity to advance our understanding of information processing, as each system offers unique computational insights that can enhance and inform the other. The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner has been shown to be more accurate than other medical devices in detecting mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity.</td>

However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological images present significant challenges in computational pathology. While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward more efficient and high-quality medical services.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The advancement of generative AI, particularly in medical imaging, confronts the trilemma of ensuring high fidelity, diversity, and efficiency in synthetic data generation. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise across various applications, they still face challenges like mode collapse and insufficient coverage of real data distributions. This work explores the use of GAN ensembles to overcome these limitations, specifically in the context of medical imaging. By solving a multi-objective optimisation problem that balances fidelity and diversity, we propose a method for selecting an optimal ensemble of GANs tailored for medical data. The selected ensemble is capable of generating diverse synthetic medical images that are representative of true data distributions and computationally efficient. Each model in the ensemble brings a unique contribution, ensuring minimal redundancy. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using three distinct medical datasets, testing 22 different GAN architectures with various loss functions and regularisation techniques. By sampling models at different training epochs, we crafted 110 unique configurations. The results highlight the capability of GAN ensembles to enhance the quality and utility of synthetic medical images, thereby improving the efficacy of downstream tasks such as diagnostic modelling.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>PCA is widely used in health and care research to analyze complex HD datasets, such as patient health records, genetic data, and medical imaging. By reducing dimensionality, PCA helps identify key patterns and trends, which can aid in disease diagnosis, treatment optimization, and the discovery of new biomarkers. However, the primary goal of any dimensional reduction technique is to reduce the dimensionality in a data set while keeping the essential information and variability. There are a few ways to do this in practice, such as the Kaiser-Guttman criterion, Cattell's Scree Test, and the percent cumulative variance approach. Unfortunately, the results of these methods are entirely different. That means using inappropriate methods to find the optimal number of PCs retained in PCA may lead to misinterpreted and inaccurate results in PCA and PCA-related health and care research applications. This contradiction becomes even more pronounced in HD settings where n < p, making it even more critical to determine the best approach. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the issues of different techniques to select the optimal number of PCs retained in PCA. Kaiser-Guttman criterion retains fewer PCs, causing overdispersion, while Cattell's scree test retains more PCs, compromising reliability. The percentage of cumulative variation criterion offers greater stability, consistently selecting the optimal number of components. Therefore, the Pareto chart, which shows both the cumulative percentage and the cut-off point for retained PCs, provides the most reliable method of selecting components, ensuring stability and enhancing PCA effectiveness, particularly in health-related research applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In orthodontic treatment, the biological response of the tooth, periodontal ligament, and bone complex to orthodontic force is crucial in influencing treatment outcomes. The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and predicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill the gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on orthodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and technologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force simulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement. Studies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and invisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as the predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant focus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics. Current orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering only the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent demand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly leveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of forecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and efficiency.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) emerging as its most prevalent subtype. Among NSCLC patients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC patients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its established efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for patients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to accurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a critical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an interpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient resistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This machine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected during patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung cancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data types such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data, demographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate well-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the superior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models (c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of combining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Following a successful pioneering study of the biological effects of antimatter ( the AD-4/ACE experiment at CERN), the use of antiprotons in clinical radiotherapy became a very serious possibility. A major part of any future radiotherapy using antiprotons will be real-time imaging of antiproton annihilation in biological targets. In principle, real-time imaging is possible thanks to the secondary particles, neutral pions and charger pions, produced by the annihilation of antiprotons in the cells they come to a stop in.Neutral pions decay dominantly and almost instantaneously into a photon pair, and one approach to real-time imaging is based on the detection of these high-energy gammas. An alternative is based on the detection of charged pions, which have lifetimes almost a billion times longer than neutral pions. This paper is a brief review of this field of research, from the first real-time imaging achieved by the AD-4/ACE experiment in 2004 to the present day.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In colonoscopy, 80% of the missed polyps could be detected with the help of Deep Learning models. In the search for algorithms capable of addressing this challenge, foundation models emerge as promising candidates. Their zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities, facilitate generalization to new data or tasks without extensive fine-tuning. A concept that is particularly advantageous in the medical imaging domain, where large annotated datasets for traditional training are scarce. In this context, a comprehensive evaluation of foundation models for polyp segmentation was conducted, assessing both detection and delimitation. For the study, three different colonoscopy datasets have been employed to compare the performance of five different foundation models, DINOv2, YOLO-World, GroundingDINO, SAM and MedSAM, against two benchmark networks, YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN. Results show that the success of foundation models in polyp characterization is highly dependent on domain specialization. For optimal performance in medical applications, domain-specific models are essential, and generic models require fine-tuning to achieve effective results. Through this specialization, foundation models demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art detection and segmentation models, with some models even excelling in zero-shot evaluation; outperforming fine-tuned models on unseen data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods allow training models to classify images and localize ROIs. WSOL only requires low-cost image-class annotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier, which is important in histology image analysis. Standard WSOL methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according to a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations with histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the limited visual ROI saliency in histology images and the limited localization cues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between classification and localization tasks. The two-step approach is sub-optimal because it is tied to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for localization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for WSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is performed in the pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with classification. This allows learning discriminant features and accurate delineation of foreground/background regions to support ROI localization and image classification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective foreground/background pixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that allows for spatial object localization. PixelCAM is trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from a pretrained WSOL model. Both image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained simultaneously using standard gradient descent. In addition, our pixel classifier can easily be integrated into CNN- and transformer-based architectures without any modifications.</td>

This work introduces IMPACT (Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality registration), a generic semantic similarity metric designed for seamless integration into diverse image registration frameworks (such as Elastix and Voxelmorph). It compares deep learning-based features extracted from medical images without requiring task-specific training, ensuring broad applicability across various modalities. By leveraging the features of the large-scale pretrained TotalSegmentator models and the ability to integrate Segment Anything Model (SAM) and other large-scale segmentation networks, this approach offers significant advantages. It provides robust, scalable, and efficient solutions for multimodal image registration. The IMPACT loss was evaluated on five challenging registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT, and pelvic MR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, such as Target Registration Error and Dice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated significant improvements in anatomical alignment compared to baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further confirmed the increased robustness of the proposed metric in the face of noise, artifacts, and modality variations. IMPACT's versatility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for advancing registration performance in clinical and research applications, addressing critical challenges in multimodal medical imaging.</td>

Despite its clinical relevance, detailed data on menstrual characteristics is rarely available in structured medical records. To address this gap, we propose a novel Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract key menstrual cycle attributes -- dysmenorrhea, regularity, flow volume, and intermenstrual bleeding. Our approach utilizes the GatorTron model with Multi-Task Prompt-based Learning, enhanced by a hybrid retrieval preprocessing step to identify relevant text segments. It out- performs baseline methods, achieving an average F1-score of 90% across all menstrual characteristics, despite being trained on fewer than 100 annotated clinical notes. The retrieval step consistently improves performance across all approaches, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant segments of lengthy clinical notes. These results show that combining multi-task learning with retrieval improves generalization and performance across menstrual charac- teristics, advancing automated extraction from clinical notes and supporting women's health research.</td>
