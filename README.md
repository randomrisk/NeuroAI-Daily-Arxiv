<td style='padding: 4px;'>The promise of large-scale, high-resolution datasets from Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-ray Microtomography (XRM) lies in their ability to reveal neural structures and synaptic connectivity, which is critical for understanding the brain. Effectively managing these complex and rapidly increasing datasets will enable new scientific insights, facilitate querying, and support secondary use across the neuroscience community. However, without effective neurodata standards that permit use of these data across multiple systems and workflows, these valuable and costly datasets risk being underutilized especially as they surpass petascale levels. These standards will promote data sharing through accessible interfaces, allow researchers to build on each other's work, and guide the development of tools and capabilities that are interoperable. Herein we outline a standards framework for creating and managing annotations originating and derived from high-resolution volumetric imaging and connectomic datasets, focusing on ensuring Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) practices. The goal is to enhance collaborative efforts, boost the reliability of findings, and enable comparative analysis across growing datasets of different species and modalities. We have formed a global working group with academic and industry partners in the high-resolution volumetric data generation and analysis community, focused on identifying gaps in current EM and XRM data pipelines, and refining outlines and platforms for standardizing EM and XRM methods. This focus considers existing and past community approaches and includes examining neuronal entities, biological components, and associated metadata, while emphasizing adaptability and fostering collaboration.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image registration is a critical process that aligns various patient scans, facilitating tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and tracking. Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that diffusion MRI tractography geometric shape descriptors can inform the study of the brain's white matter pathways and their relationship to brain function. In this work, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a deep learning model to compute shape measures of the brain's white matter connections. We introduce a novel framework, TractShapeNet, that leverages a point cloud representation of tractography to compute five shape measures: length, span, volume, total surface area, and irregularity. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing neuron morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data is critical to aid neuroscientists in analyzing brain networks and neuroanatomy. With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate segmentation of brain metastases (BMs) in MR image is crucial for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. Methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high segmentation performance. However, due to the loss of critical feature information caused by convolutional and pooling operations, CNNs still face great challenges in small BMs segmentation. Besides, BMs are irregular and easily confused with healthy tissues, which makes it difficult for the model to effectively learn tumor structure during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model called feature-guided attention network with curriculum learning (FANCL). Based on CNNs, FANCL utilizes the input image and its feature to establish the intrinsic connections between metastases of different sizes, which can effectively compensate for the loss of high-level feature from small tumors with the information of large tumors. Furthermore, FANCL applies the voxel-level curriculum learning strategy to help the model gradually learn the structure and details of BMs. And baseline models of varying depths are employed as curriculum-mining networks for organizing the curriculum progression. The evaluation results on the BraTS-METS 2023 dataset indicate that FANCL significantly improves the segmentation performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method.</td>

People with disabilities are facing a real-time problem of doing simple activities such as grasping, handshaking etc. in order to aid with this problem, the use of brain signals to control actuators is showing a great importance. The Emotive Insight, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) device, is utilized in this project to collect brain signals and transform them into commands for controlling a robotic arm using an Arduino controller. The Emotive Insight captures brain signals, which are subsequently analyzed using Emotive software and connected with Arduino code. The HITI Brain software integrates these devices, allowing for smooth communication between brain activity and the robotic arm. This system demonstrates how brain impulses may be utilized to control external devices directly. The results showed that the system is applicable efficiently to robotic arms and also for prosthetic arms with Multi Degree of Freedom. In addition to that, the system can be used for other actuators such as bikes, mobile robots, wheelchairs etc.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Increasing advances in affordable consumer hardware and accessible software frameworks are now bringing Virtual Reality (VR) to the masses. Especially collaborative VR applications where different people can work together are gaining momentum. In this context, human avatars and their representations are a crucial aspect of collaborative VR applications as they represent a digital twin of the end-users and determine how one is perceived in a virtual environment. When it comes to the effect of avatar representation on the end-users of collaborative VR applications, so far mostly questionnaires have been used to assess the quality of avatar representations. A promising alternative to objectively measure the effect of avatar representation is the investigation of inter-brain connections during the usage of a collaborative VR application. However, the combination of immersive VR applications and inter-brain connections has not been fully researched yet. Thus, our work investigates how different human avatar representations (real (RL), full-body (FB), and head-hand (HH)) affect inter-brain connections. For this purpose, we have designed and conducted a hyperscanning study with eight pairs. The main results of our hyperscanning study show that the number of significant sensor pairs was the highest in the RL, medium in the FB, and lowest in the HH condition indicating that an avatar that looks more like a real human enables more significant sensor pairs to appear in an EEG analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI closely interacts with human society, it is crucial to ensure that its decision-making is safe, altruistic, and aligned with human ethical and moral values. However, existing research on embedding ethical and moral considerations into AI remains insufficient, and previous external constraints based on principles and rules are inadequate to provide AI with long-term stability and generalization capabilities. In contrast, the intrinsic altruistic motivation based on empathy is more willing, spontaneous, and robust. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to autonomously driving intelligent agents to acquire morally behaviors through human-like affective empathy mechanisms. We draw inspiration from the neural mechanism of human brain's moral intuitive decision-making, and simulate the mirror neuron system to construct a brain-inspired affective empathy-driven altruistic decision-making model. Here, empathy directly impacts dopamine release to form intrinsic altruistic motivation. Based on the principle of moral utilitarianism, we design the moral reward function that integrates intrinsic empathy and extrinsic self-task goals. A comprehensive experimental scenario incorporating empathetic processes, personal objectives, and altruistic goals is developed. The proposed model enables the agent to make consistent moral decisions (prioritizing altruism) by balancing self-interest with the well-being of others. We further introduce inhibitory neurons to regulate different levels of empathy and verify the positive correlation between empathy levels and altruistic preferences, yielding conclusions consistent with findings from psychological behavioral experiments. This work provides a feasible solution for the development of ethical AI by leveraging the intrinsic human-like empathy mechanisms, and contributes to the harmonious coexistence between humans and AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this study for brain tumor classification, based on transfer learning and the Vision Mamba model, is broadly applicable to other medical imaging classification problems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain tumor detection in multiplane Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is a challenging task due to the various appearances and relationships in the structure of the multiplane images. In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG-based visual perception reconstruction has become a current research hotspot. Neuroscientific studies have shown that humans can perceive various types of visual information, such as color, shape, and texture, when observing objects. However, existing technical methods often face issues such as inconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimulus images and the reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing 3D objects with color consistency based on EEG signals. The method adopts a two-stage strategy: in the first stage, we train an implicit neural EEG encoder with the capability of perceiving 3D objects, enabling it to capture regional semantic features; in the second stage, based on the latent EEG codes obtained in the first stage, we integrate a diffusion model, neural style loss, and NeRF to implicitly decode the 3D objects. Finally, through experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct 3D objects with color consistency using EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The analysis of neural power spectra plays a crucial role in understanding brain function and dysfunction. While recent efforts have led to the development of methods for decomposing spectral data, challenges remain in performing statistical analysis and group-level comparisons. Here, we introduce Bayesian Spectral Decomposition (BSD), a Bayesian framework for analysing neural spectral power. BSD allows for the specification, inversion, comparison, and analysis of parametric models of neural spectra, addressing limitations of existing methods. We first establish the face validity of BSD on simulated data and show how it outperforms an established method (\fooof{}) for peak detection on artificial spectral data. We then demonstrate the efficacy of BSD on a group-level study of EEG spectra in 204 healthy subjects from the LEMON dataset. Our results not only highlight the effectiveness of BSD in model selection and parameter estimation, but also illustrate how BSD enables straightforward group-level regression of the effect of continuous covariates such as age. By using Bayesian inference techniques, BSD provides a robust framework for studying neural spectral data and their relationship to brain function and dysfunction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces an innovative framework designed for progressive (granular in time to onset) prediction of seizures through the utilization of a Deep Learning (DL) methodology based on non-invasive multi-modal sensor networks. Epilepsy, a debilitating neurological condition, affects an estimated 65 million individuals globally, with a substantial proportion facing drug-resistant epilepsy despite pharmacological interventions. To address this challenge, we advocate for predictive systems that provide timely alerts to individuals at risk, enabling them to take precautionary actions. Our framework employs advanced DL techniques and uses personalized data from a network of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions. Our multi-modal model achieves 95% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 97% accuracy, averaged among 29 patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In daily interactions, emotions are frequently conveyed and triggered through verbal exchanges. Sometimes, we must modulate our emotional reactions to align with societal norms. Among the emotional words, taboo words represent a specific category that has been poorly studied. One intriguing question is whether these word categories can be predicted from EEG responses with the use of machine learning methods. To address this question, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to decode the word categories from Event Related Potential (ERP) in 40 native Italian speakers. 240 neutral, negative and taboo words were used to this aim. Results indicate that the SVM classifier successfully distinguished between the three-word categories, with significant differences in neural activity ascribed to the late positive potential mainly detected in the central-parietal-occipital and anterior right scalp areas in the time windows of 450-649 ms and 650-850 ms. These findings were in line with the established distribution pattern of the late positive potential. Intriguingly, the study also revealed that word categories were still detectable in the regulate condition. This study extends previous results on the domain of the cortical responses of taboo words, and how machine learning methods can be used to predict word categories from EEG responses.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The symbolic correlation integral provides a way to measure the complexity of time series and dynamical systems. In the present article we prove limit results for an estimator of this quantity which is based on U-statistics under the assumption of short-range dependence. To this end, we slightly generalize classical limit results in the framework of 1-approximating functionals. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the limit variance. A simulation study with ARMA and ARCH time series as well as a real world data example are also provided. In the latter we show how our method could be used to analyze EEG data in the context of epileptic seizures.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Carrying conversations in multi-sound environments is one of the more challenging tasks, since the sounds overlap across time and frequency making it difficult to understand a single sound source. One proposed approach to help isolate an attended speech source is through decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) and identifying the attended audio source using statistical or machine learning techniques. However, the limited amount of data in comparison to other machine learning problems and the distributional shift between different EEG recordings emphasizes the need for a self supervised approach that works with limited data to achieve a more robust solution. In this paper, we propose a method based on self supervised learning to minimize the difference between the latent representations of an attended speech signal and the corresponding EEG signal. This network is further finetuned for the auditory attention classification task. We compare our results with previously published methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multi-channel EEG signals are commonly used for the diagnosis and assessment of diseases such as epilepsy. Currently, various EEG diagnostic algorithms based on deep learning have been developed. However, most research efforts focus solely on diagnosing and classifying current signal data but do not consider the prediction of future trends for early warning. Additionally, since multi-channel EEG can be essentially regarded as the spatio-temporal signal data received by detectors at different locations in the brain, how to construct spatio-temporal information representations of EEG signals to facilitate future trend prediction for multi-channel EEG becomes an important problem. This study proposes a multi-signal prediction algorithm based on generative diffusion models (EEG-DIF), which transforms the multi-signal forecasting task into an image completion task, allowing for comprehensive representation and learning of the spatio-temporal correlations and future developmental patterns of multi-channel EEG signals. Here, we employ a publicly available epilepsy EEG dataset to construct and validate the EEG-DIF. The results demonstrate that our method can accurately predict future trends for multi-channel EEG signals simultaneously. Furthermore, the early warning accuracy for epilepsy seizures based on the generated EEG data reaches 0.89. In general, EEG-DIF provides a novel approach for characterizing multi-channel EEG signals and an innovative early warning algorithm for epilepsy seizures, aiding in optimizing and enhancing the clinical diagnosis process. The code is available at https://github.com/JZK00/EEG-DIF.</td>

People with disabilities are facing a real-time problem of doing simple activities such as grasping, handshaking etc. in order to aid with this problem, the use of brain signals to control actuators is showing a great importance. The Emotive Insight, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) device, is utilized in this project to collect brain signals and transform them into commands for controlling a robotic arm using an Arduino controller. The Emotive Insight captures brain signals, which are subsequently analyzed using Emotive software and connected with Arduino code. The HITI Brain software integrates these devices, allowing for smooth communication between brain activity and the robotic arm. This system demonstrates how brain impulses may be utilized to control external devices directly.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The rapid evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human-computer interaction, with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG)--based turn intention prediction for lower limb movement is important to build an efficient brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants. The decoding analysis shows the feasibility of turn intention prediction for lower limb movement using the EEG signal before the event onset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.</td>

This study addresses the challenges of detecting P300 event-related potentials in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and integrating these P300 responses for character spelling, particularly within oddball paradigms characterized by uneven P300 distribution, low target probability, and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

For character recognition, the model achieved average accuracies of 76.5\%, 87.5\%, and 94.5\% with five, ten, and fifteen repetitions, respectively.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a technique used to optimize and reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of machine learning models. It has been used primarily for neural networks. For Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that are fully portable and usable in various situations, it is necessary to provide approaches that are lightweight for storage and computation. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of post-training quantization on state-of-the-art approaches in brain-computer interfaces and assess their impact on accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the single-trial detection of event-related potentials representing one major BCI paradigm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve drops from 0.861 to 0.825 with PTQ when applied on both spatial filters and the classifier, while reducing the size of the model by about $\times$ 15. The results support the conclusion that PTQ can substantially reduce the memory footprint of the models while keeping roughly the same level of accuracy.</td>

Yet, a mechanistic computational model of each individual learning trajectory is required to improve the reliability of BCI applications. The few existing attempts mostly rely on model-free (reinforcement learning) approaches. Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training. We show how simple changes in model parameters allow us to qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject. In the near future, this approach may provide a powerful computational to model individual skill learning and thus optimize and finely characterize BCI training.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural encoding of artificial neural networks (ANNs) links their computational representations to brain responses, offering insights into how the brain processes information. Current studies mostly use linear encoding models for clarity, even though brain responses are often nonlinear. This has sparked interest in developing nonlinear encoding models that are still interpretable. To address this problem, we propose LinBridge, a learnable and flexible framework based on Jacobian analysis for interpreting nonlinear encoding models. LinBridge posits that the nonlinear mapping between ANN representations and neural responses can be factorized into a linear inherent component that approximates the complex nonlinear relationship, and a mapping bias that captures sample-selective nonlinearity. The Jacobian matrix, which reflects output change rates relative to input, enables the analysis of sample-selective mapping in nonlinear models. LinBridge employs a self-supervised learning strategy to extract both the linear inherent component and nonlinear mapping biases from the Jacobian matrices of the test set, allowing it to adapt effectively to various nonlinear encoding models. We validate the LinBridge framework in the scenario of neural visual encoding, using computational visual representations from CLIP-ViT to predict brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the linear inherent component extracted by LinBridge accurately reflects the complex mappings of nonlinear neural encoding models; 2) the sample-selective mapping bias elucidates the variability of nonlinearity across different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. This study presents a novel tool for interpreting nonlinear neural encoding models and offers fresh evidence about hierarchical nonlinearity distribution in the visual cortex.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures.   The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches.   By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The growing use of naturalistic stimuli, such as feature films, brings research on emotions closer to ecologically valid settings within brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces NeuGPT, a groundbreaking multi-modal language generation model designed to harmonize the fragmented landscape of neural recording research. Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F. It can also simulate brain signals, thereby serving as a novel neural interface.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the morphology of galaxies is a critical aspect of astrophysics research, providing insight into the formation, evolution, and physical properties of these vast cosmic structures. Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\sim200$ for 2D images and $\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image registration is a critical process that aligns various patient scans, facilitating tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and tracking. Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image segmentation is pivotal in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, informing treatment strategies, and tracking disease progression. This process allows clinicians to extract critical information from visual data, enabling personalized patient care. However, developing neural networks for segmentation remains challenging, especially when preserving image resolution, which is essential in detecting subtle details that influence diagnoses. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these deep learning models has slowed their adoption in clinical practice. Efforts in model interpretability are increasingly focused on making these models' decision-making processes more transparent. In this paper, we introduce MAPUNetR, a novel architecture that synergizes the strengths of transformer models with the proven U-Net framework for medical image segmentation. Our model addresses the resolution preservation challenge and incorporates attention maps highlighting segmented regions, increasing accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, MAPUNetR achieved a dice score of 0.88 and a dice coefficient of 0.92 on the ISIC 2018 dataset. Our experiments show that the model maintains stable performance and potential as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation in clinical practice.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (MedVLP) shows promise in learning generalizable and transferable visual representations from paired and unpaired medical images and reports. MedVLP can provide useful features to downstream tasks and facilitate adapting task-specific models to new setups using fewer examples. However, existing MedVLP methods often differ in terms of datasets, preprocessing, and finetuning implementations. This pose great challenges in evaluating how well a MedVLP method generalizes to various clinically-relevant tasks due to the lack of unified, standardized, and comprehensive benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that the performance of some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>\emph{Objective.} This study conceptualizes the ionization dose to water as the dose absorbed to water and expended exclusively on ionization, which is essential for radiation therapy, and formulates its dosimetric procedures for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. It also aims to design optimal ionization chambers to reduce large dosimetric uncertainty for proton and ion beams. \emph{Approach.} Based on the international code of practice, the dosimetric procedure without the $W$-value correction was formulated for all beams, and that without the stopping-power-ratio correction was formulated for proton and ion beams. For the latter, water-equivalent gas was considered for gas-sealed ionization chambers. Reference dosimetry was performed virtually for test beams. \emph{Main results.} For photon and electron beams, the ionization dose was essentially equivalent to the absorbed dose. For proton and ion beams, dosimetric uncertainties were greatly reduced, especially with water-equivalent gas, to \SI{0.7}{\%} and \SI{1.0}{\%}, respectively. Nitrogen-based water-equivalent gas mixtures were designed with helium, methane, and ethane. Dosimetry with the helium mixture was prone and sensitive to leakage, while the methane and ethane mixtures were flammable. \emph{Significance.} The ionization dose with reduced beam quality corrections provides dose representations of improved accuracy and relevance to radiation therapy, particularly for proton and ion beams.</td>

Noise reduction from images is still a challenging task. Digital Image Processing is a component of Digital signal processing. A wide variety of algorithms can be used in image processing to apply to an image or an input dataset and obtain important outcomes. In image processing research, removing noise from images before further analysis is essential. Post-noise removal of images improves clarity, enabling better interpretation and analysis across medical imaging, satellite imagery, and radar applications. While numerous algorithms exist, each comes with its own assumptions, strengths, and limitations. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different filtering techniques on images with eight types of noise. It evaluates methodologies like Wiener, Median, Gaussian, Mean, Low pass, High pass, Laplacian and bilateral filtering, using the performance metric Peak signal to noise ratio. It shows us the impact of different filters on noise models by applying a variety of filters to various kinds of noise. Additionally, it also assists us in determining which filtering strategy is most appropriate for a certain noise model based on the circumstances.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) are essential for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring various diseases, particularly cancer. Despite their importance, the use of PET/CT systems is limited by the necessity for radioactive materials, the scarcity of PET scanners, and the high cost associated with PET imaging. In contrast, CT scanners are more widely available and significantly less expensive. In response to these challenges, our study addresses the issue of generating PET images from CT images, aiming to reduce both the medical examination cost and the associated health risks for patients. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a conditional diffusion model named CPDM, which, to our knowledge, is one of the initial attempts to employ a diffusion model for translating from CT to PET images. Second, we provide the largest CT-PET dataset to date, comprising 2,028,628 paired CT-PET images, which facilitates the training and evaluation of CT-to-PET translation models. For the CPDM model, we incorporate domain knowledge to develop two conditional maps: the Attention map and the Attenuation map. The former helps the diffusion process focus on areas of interest, while the latter improves PET data correction and ensures accurate diagnostic information. Experimental evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that CPDM surpasses existing methods in generating high-quality PET images in terms of multiple metrics.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Severity level estimation is a crucial task in medical image diagnosis. However, accurately assigning severity class labels to individual images is very costly and challenging. Consequently, the attached labels tend to be noisy. In this paper, we propose a new framework for training with ``ordinal'' noisy labels. Since severity levels have an ordinal relationship, we can leverage this to train a classifier while mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels. Our framework uses two techniques: clean sample selection and dual-network architecture. A technical highlight of our approach is the use of soft labels derived from noisy hard labels. By appropriately using the soft and hard labels in the two techniques, we achieve more accurate sample selection and robust network training. The proposed method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in experiments using two endoscopic ulcerative colitis (UC) datasets and a retinal Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) dataset.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this study for brain tumor classification, based on transfer learning and the Vision Mamba model, is broadly applicable to other medical imaging classification problems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spatial control methods using additional modules on pretrained diffusion models have gained attention for enabling conditional generation in natural images. These methods guide the generation process with new conditions while leveraging the capabilities of large models. They could be beneficial as training strategies in the context of 3D medical imaging, where training a diffusion model from scratch is challenging due to high computational costs and data scarcity. However, the potential application of spatial control methods with additional modules to 3D medical images has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present a tailored spatial control method for 3D medical images with a novel lightweight module, Volumetric Conditioning Module (VCM). Our VCM employs an asymmetric U-Net architecture to effectively encode complex information from various levels of 3D conditions, providing detailed guidance in image synthesis. To examine the applicability of spatial control methods and the effectiveness of VCM for 3D medical data, we conduct experiments under single- and multimodal conditions scenarios across a wide range of dataset sizes, from extremely small datasets with 10 samples to large datasets with 500 samples. The experimental results show that the VCM is effective for conditional generation and efficient in terms of requiring less training data and computational resources. We further investigate the potential applications for our spatial control method through axial super-resolution for medical images. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Ahn-Ssu/VCM}</td>
