<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-resolution slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) from multiple motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D slices constitutes a critical step in image-based diagnostics of moving subjects, such as fetal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions struggle with image artifacts and severe subject motion or require slice pre-alignment to achieve satisfying reconstruction performance. We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion corruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and super-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on implicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with task-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either simulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480 reconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different centers, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion and image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to state-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Repeated exposure to blast overpressure in occupational settings has been associated with changes in cognitive and psychological health, as well as deficits in neurosensory subsystems. In this work, we describe a wearable system to simultaneously monitor physiology and blast exposure levels and demonstrate how this system can identify individualized exposure levels corresponding to acute physiological response to blast exposure. Machine learning was used to develop a dose-response model that fused multiple physiological measures (electrooculuography, gait, and balance) into a single risk score by predicting the level of blast exposure on held-out subjects (Fused model, R = 0.60). We found that blast events with peak pressure levels as low as 0.25 psi could be related to physiological changes and hence may contribute to blast injury. We also identified an individual subject with deteriorating reaction time scores that consistently showed a rapid and anomalous change in physiology-based risk scores after exposure to low-level blast events. Our results suggest that the wearable approach to blast monitoring is viable in weapons training environments as a complement to more direct but sparsely administered brain health assessments, potentially viable in austere environments, and that fusing multiple physiological signals can improve sensitivity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.   Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).   Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large-scale language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and natural language understanding. Although scaling up model parameters with increasing volume of training data has progressively improved DNN capabilities, achieving complex cognitive abilities - such as understanding abstract concepts, reasoning, and adapting to novel scenarios, which are intrinsic to human cognition - remains a major challenge. In this study, we show that brain-in-the-loop supervised learning, utilizing a small set of brain signals, can effectively transfer human conceptual structures to DNNs, significantly enhancing their comprehension of abstract and even unseen concepts. Experimental results further indicate that the enhanced cognitive capabilities lead to substantial performance gains in challenging tasks, including few-shot/zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution recognition, while also yielding highly interpretable concept representations. These findings highlight that human-in-the-loop supervision can effectively augment the complex cognitive abilities of large models, offering a promising pathway toward developing more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised pretrain techniques have been widely used to improve the downstream tasks' performance. However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR) studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study. With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain, and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively. These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments, and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development. Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving non-convex regularized inverse problems is challenging due to their complex optimization landscapes and multiple local minima. However, these models remain widely studied as they often yield high-quality, task-oriented solutions, particularly in medical imaging, where the goal is to enhance clinically relevant features rather than merely minimizing global error. We propose incDG, a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning with incremental model-based optimization to efficiently approximate the $\ell_0$-optimal solution of imaging inverse problems. Built on the Deep Guess strategy, incDG exploits a deep neural network to generate effective initializations for a non-convex variational solver, which refines the reconstruction through regularized incremental iterations. This design combines the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with the theoretical guarantees of model-based optimization, ensuring robustness and stability. We validate incDG on TpV-regularized optimization tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in medical image deblurring and tomographic reconstruction across diverse datasets, including synthetic images, brain CT slices, and chest-abdomen scans. Results show that incDG outperforms both conventional iterative solvers and deep learning-based methods, achieving superior accuracy and stability. Moreover, we confirm that training incDG without ground truth does not significantly degrade performance, making it a practical and powerful tool for solving non-convex inverse problems in imaging and beyond.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Based on the concept that ventral visual stream (VVS) mainly functions for object recognition, current unsupervised task-driven methods model VVS by contrastive learning, and have achieved good brain similarity. However, we believe functions of VVS extend beyond just object recognition. In this paper, we introduce an additional function involving VVS, named relative position (RP) prediction. We first theoretically explain contrastive learning may be unable to yield the model capability of RP prediction. Motivated by this, we subsequently integrate RP learning with contrastive learning, and propose a new unsupervised task-driven method to model VVS, which is more inline with biological reality. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating that: (i) our method significantly improves downstream performance of object recognition while enhancing RP predictivity; (ii) RP predictivity generally improves the model brain similarity. Our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of VVS in location perception (especially RP prediction) from a computational perspective.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are powerful mathematical models that integrate the biological details of neural systems, but their complexity often makes them computationally expensive and analytically untractable. The firing rate of an SNN is a crucial first-order statistic to characterize network activity. However, estimating firing rates analytically from even simplified SNN models is challenging due to 1) the intricate dependence between the nonlinear network dynamics and parameters, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. In this Letter, we propose a class of computationally efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates. This is based on a hierarchy of Markovian approximations that reduces the complexity of SNN dynamics. We show that while considering firing rates alone is insufficient for accurate estimations of themselves, the information of spiking synchrony dramatically improves the estimator's accuracy. This approach provides a practical tool for brain modelers, directly mapping biological parameters to firing rate.</td>

The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) is a neurological condition that occurs in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is marked by suppressed signals just after the seizure before the brain gradually recovers. Recovery from PGES involves a mixed state of amplitude suppression and high-amplitude oscillations, exhibiting a bimodal exponential distribution in power, unlike the unimodal exponential distribution of PGES. In this study, using the subcritical Hopf model, we explain the nature of phase transitions that underlie PGES. Our results reveal that recovery from PGES involves a change from a fixed point state to a bistable state (mixed phase), effectively captured by the noisy fixed-point and bistable regimes of the model. Consistent patterns across patients suggest a universal dynamical signature in PGES recovery. Our findings offer a mechanistic understanding of seizure termination and postictal brain state transitions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining, extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.</td>

A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern.Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying preictal states -- periods during which seizures are more likely to occur -- remains a central challenge in clinical computational neuroscience. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that embeds functional brain connectivity networks, derived from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has demonstrated the possibility of restoring brain-controlled walking in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate classification of EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetic applications, yet many existing methods fail to account for the non-Euclidean, manifold structure of EEG data, resulting in suboptimal performance. Preserving this manifold information is essential to capture the true geometry of EEG signals, but traditional classification techniques largely overlook this need. To this end, we propose MPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based Classifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2) a clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity. Ensembling multiple clustering-based classifiers, MPEC achieves superior results, validated by significant improvements on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper explores silent speech decoding in active brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which offer more natural and flexible communication than traditional BCI applications. We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Our research advances silent speech decoding in active BCI systems, offering an innovative solution for EEG language model pretraining and a new dataset for fundamental research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the Riemannian minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier for all kinds of EEG-based brain--computer interfaces (BCIs). This classifier is simple, fully deterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to transfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation of a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior. In order to promote reproducible research, our code will be released as open source.</td>

We present a neuroadaptive haptics system that adapts XR feedback through reinforcement learning (RL) from explicit user ratings and brain-decoded neural signals. In a user study, participants interacted with virtual objects in VR while Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. An RL agent adjusted haptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural decoder. Results show that the RL agent's performance was comparable across feedback sources, suggesting that implicit neural feedback can effectively guide personalization without requiring active user input. The EEG-based neural decoder achieved a mean F1 score of 0.8, supporting reliable classification of user experience. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and RL to autonomously adapt XR interactions, reducing cognitive load and enhancing immersion.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the brain and external equipment through EEG, which is preferred for its superior temporal resolution. Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To enable run-time head motion control and robust frequency corrections for 3D EPI fMRI. Methods: A short 3D orbital navigator (3 ms) is inserted into a 3D EPI sequence. A linear perturbation model is calibrated to estimate rigid motion and frequency parameters per shot. Rigid motion is corrected by scan geometry updates in run-time, while several techniques are investigated to stabilize navigator-based frequency corrections in the reconstruction. An additional method termed PEERS is proposed that exploits the repetitive structure of fMRI scans to fine-tune shot-wise phase and frequency estimates using the motion-corrected EPI data itself. Results: Servo navigation effectively reduces motion in the raw data of in-vivo fMRI scans in six subjects. PEERS provides high-precision frequency parameters for robust phase-corrected reconstructions in the phantom and in-vivo accounting for scanner drifts and slice encoding-related effects on EPI. In combination, servo navigation and PEERS achieve successful intra-volume corrections and consistent tSNR improvements of 8% on average throughout the brain. The two methods prove to be highly synergetic. Conclusion: Servo navigation achieves high-precision motion correction for 3D-EPI fMRI in run-time and, in synergy with PEERS, provides stable frequency corrections with short navigators even for long echo times. With its automatic self-calibration and no hardware requirements, servo navigation and PEERS enable effective plug-and-play motion correction for 3D fMRI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.</td>

Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment. However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods. Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to 7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord neuroimaging group analysis.</td>

We formulate a system of differential equations to simulate interactions among these variables and validate the model using simulated neural data. Our results demonstrate biologically plausible cognitive patterns consistent with findings from EEG and fMRI studies, particularly related to the default mode network (DMN), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and hippocampal memory mechanisms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional insights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics. Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting disease states from functional brain connectivity is critical for the early diagnosis of severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals. However, recent neuroscience studies found that such node-based connectivity does not accurately capture ``functional connections" within the brain. This paper proposes a novel approach to brain network analysis that emphasizes edge functional connectivity (eFC), shifting the focus to inter-edge relationships. Additionally, we introduce a co-embedding technique to integrate edge functional connections effectively. Experimental results on the ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN methods in classifying functional brain networks.</td>

We focus on the three "golden channels": $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} \gamma$, $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+}$ and $\mu^{-} N \rightarrow e^{-} N$. The collection of upcoming experiments aim for sensitivity improvements up to $10^{4}$ with respect to previous searches. The MEG II experiment, searching for $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} \gamma$, is currently in its 4th year of physics data-taking with a published result from its first year of data. The Mu3e experiment is an upcoming experiment searching for $\mu^{+} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} e^{+}$ with plans of physics data-taking as soon as 2025. The Mu2e and COMET experiments are upcoming searches for $\mu^{-} N \rightarrow e^{-} N$ with the goal of physics data-taking starting in 2027 and 2026 respectively. This proceeding summarizes the signal signature, expected background, resolutions, and timelines for the mentioned searches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

In this work, we compute the monitoring edge-geodetic number efficiently for the following graph classes: distance-hereditary graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, and strongly chordal graphs. The algorithms follow from structural characterizations of the optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for these graph classes in terms of \emph{mandatory vertices} (those that need to be in every solution).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cardiac image segmentation is an important step in many cardiac image analysis and modeling tasks such as motion tracking or simulations of cardiac mechanics. While deep learning has greatly advanced segmentation in clinical settings, there is limited work on pre-clinical imaging, notably in porcine models, which are often used due to their anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. However, differences between species create a domain shift that complicates direct model transfer from human to pig data.   Recently, foundation models trained on large human datasets have shown promise for robust medical image segmentation; yet their applicability to porcine data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can generate sufficiently accurate pseudo-labels for pig cardiac CT and propose a simple self-training approach to iteratively refine these labels. Our method requires no manually annotated pig data, relying instead on iterative updates to improve segmentation quality. We demonstrate that this self-training process not only enhances segmentation accuracy but also smooths out temporal inconsistencies across consecutive frames. Although our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement, for example by incorporating more sophisticated self-training strategies and by exploring additional foundation models and other cardiac imaging technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In imaging inverse problems, we would like to know how close the recovered image is to the true image in terms of full-reference image quality (FRIQ) metrics like PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc. This is especially important in safety-critical applications like medical imaging, where knowing that, say, the SSIM was poor could potentially avoid a costly misdiagnosis. But since we don't know the true image, computing FRIQ is non-trivial. In this work, we combine conformal prediction with approximate posterior sampling to construct bounds on FRIQ that are guaranteed to hold up to a user-specified error probability. We demonstrate our approach on image denoising and accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) problems. Code is available at https://github.com/jwen307/quality_uq.</td>

Endo-CLIP's three-stage framework--cleansing, attunement, and unification--addresses these challenges by (1) removing background frames, (2) leveraging large language models to extract clinical attributes for fine-grained contrastive learning, and (3) employing patient-level cross-attention to resolve multi-polyp ambiguities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Endo-CLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pre-training methods in zero-shot and few-shot polyp detection and classification, paving the way for more accurate and clinically relevant endoscopic analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Measurement of pressure distribution applied to a fingertip is crucial for the teleoperation of robots and human computer interface. Previous studies have acquired pressure distribution by affixing a sensor array to the fingertip or by optically recording the deformation of an object. However, these existing methods inhibit the fingertip from directly contacting the texture, and the pressure applied to the fingertip is measured indirectly. In this study, we propose a method to measure pressure distribution by directly touching a transparent object, focusing on the change in skin color induced by the applied pressure, caused by blood flow. We evaluated the relationship between pressure and skin color change when local pressure is applied, and found a correlation between the pressure and the color change. However, the contact area and the color change area did not align perfectly. We further explored the factor causing the spatial non-uniformity of the color change, by accounting for the stress distribution using finite element analysis. These results suggest that the proposed measurement method can be utilized to measure the internal stress distribution, and it is anticipated to serve as a simple sensor in the field of human computer interface.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.   Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).   Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dermatological diagnosis represents a complex multimodal challenge that requires integrating visual features with specialized clinical knowledge. While vision-language pretraining (VLP) has advanced medical AI, its effectiveness in dermatology is limited by text length constraints and the lack of structured texts. In this paper, we introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks. Recognizing that comprehensive dermatological descriptions require multiple knowledge aspects that exceed standard text constraints, our framework introduces: (1) a multi-aspect contrastive learning strategy that decomposes clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts through large language models, (2) a fine-grained alignment mechanism that connects subcaptions with diagnostically relevant image features, and (3) a diagnosis-guided weighting scheme that adaptively prioritizes different sub-captions based on clinical significance prior. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text pairs collected from education resources, MAKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, where early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for improving survival rates. While deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized medical image analysis by detecting subtle patterns indicative of early-stage lung cancer, its adoption faces challenges. These models are often computationally expensive and require significant resources, making them unsuitable for resource constrained environments. Additionally, their lack of transparency hinders trust and broader adoption in sensitive fields like healthcare. Knowledge distillation addresses these challenges by transferring knowledge from large, complex models (teachers) to smaller, lightweight models (students). We propose a knowledge distillation-based approach for lung cancer detection, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model transparency. Eight CNNs, including ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, and VGG16, are evaluated as teacher models. We developed and trained a lightweight student model, Distilled Custom Student Network (DCSNet) using ResNet50 as the teacher. This approach not only ensures high diagnostic performance in resource-constrained settings but also addresses transparency concerns, facilitating the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools in healthcare.</td>

Despite extensive studies on scaling behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation. Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task, traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image processing.</td>
