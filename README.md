<td style='padding: 4px;'>Butterfly tumors are a distinct class of gliomas that span the corpus callosum, producing a characteristic butterfly-shaped appearance on MRI. The distinctive growth pattern of these tumors highlights how white matter fibers and structural connectivity influence brain tumor cell migration. To investigate this relation, we applied biophysical tumor growth models to a large patient cohort, systematically comparing models that incorporate fiber tract information with those that do not. Our results demonstrate that including fiber orientation data significantly improves model accuracy, particularly for a subset of butterfly tumors. These findings highlight the critical role of white matter architecture in tumor spread and suggest that integrating fiber tract information can enhance the precision of radiotherapy target volume delineation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography(EEG) based emotion recognition holds great promise for affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs), yet practical deployment remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and the lack of labeled data in target domains. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel unsupervised Semantic-Dynamic Consistency domain adaptation network for fully label-free cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. First, we introduce a Same-Subject Same-Trial Mixup strategy that generates augmented samples via intra-trial interpolation, enhancing data diversity while explicitly preserving individual identity to mitigate label ambiguity. Second, we construct a dynamic distribution alignment module in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), jointly aligning marginal and conditional distributions through multi-objective kernel mean embedding, and leveraging a confidence-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to ensure stable adaptation. Third, we propose a dual-domain similarity consistency learning mechanism that enforces cross-domain structural constraints based on latent pairwise similarities, enabling semantic boundary learning without relying on temporal synchronization or label priors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SDC-Net, extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used EEG benchmark datasets: SEED, SEED-IV, and Faced. Comparative results against existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods demonstrate that SDC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition under both cross-subject and cross-session conditions. This advancement significantly improves the accuracy and generalization capability of emotion decoding, and lays a solid foundation for real-world applications of personalized affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). The source code will be released at https://github.com/XuanSuTrum/SDC-Net.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting anomalies while reducing false positive rates.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Adaptive link sizes is a major breakthrough step in evolving networks and is now considered as an essential process both in biological and artificial neural networks. In adaptive networks the link weights change in time and, in brain dynamics, these changes are controlled by the potential variations of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. In particular, in biological neural networks the adaptivity of the links (synapses) was first addressed by D. Hebb who proposed the rule that neurons which fire together wire together. In the present study, we explore the effects of adaptive linking in networks where hybrid synchronization patterns (solitaries, chimeras and bump states) are observed in the absence of adaptivity (i.e., for constant coupling strengths). The network consists of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons coupled nonlocally in a 1D ring geometry. The adaptivity follows the Hebbian principle adjusted by the Oja rule to avoid unbounded increase of the coupling strengths. Our results indicate that, for negative coupling strengths, the adaptive LIF network may transit through chimera state regimes with different multiplicity, provided that the time scales governing the link dynamics are relatively small compared to the time scales of the potential evolution. Moreover, the size of the coherent and incoherent domains of the chimera and their multiplicity change following the average coupling strength in the network. Similar results are shown for the case of bump states: for positive coupling strengths, the adaptive LIF network transits through states of different number of active and subthreshold domains. The size and number of these domains also follow the evolution of the average coupling strength. Such transient effects are suppressed when the time scales governing the link adaptive dynamics become of the same order as the time scales governing the potential dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, noise presents a persistent challenge, often compromising the quality of EEG signals essential for accurate data interpretation. This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for achieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address the issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by non-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line interference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of problematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting (ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify channels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR topographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the impact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery (MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%] (confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions), significantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]). These results underscore the critical role of channel selection and the potential of using blink patterns for detecting bad EEG channels, offering valuable insights for improving real-time or offline BCI systems by reducing noise and enhancing signal quality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational, agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and (ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.   Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Biostasis has the potential to extend human lives by offering a bridge to powerful life extension technologies that may be developed in the future. However, key questions in the field remain unresolved, including which biomarkers reliably indicate successful preservation, what technical obstacles pose the greatest barriers, and whether different proposed revival methods are theoretically feasible. To address these gaps, we conducted a collaborative forecasting exercise with 22 practitioners in biostasis, including individuals with expertise in neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care. Our results reveal substantial consensus in some areas, for example that synaptic connectivity can serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for information preservation quality. Practitioners identified three most likely failure modes in contemporary biostasis: inadequate preservation quality even under ideal conditions, geographic barriers preventing timely preservation, and poor procedural execution. Regarding revival strategies, most respondents believe that provably reversible cryopreservation of whole mammalian organisms is most likely decades away, with provably reversible human cryopreservation expected even later, if it is ever achieved. Among revival strategies from contemporary preservation methods, whole brain emulation was considered the most likely to be developed first, though respondents were divided on the metaphysical question of whether it could constitute genuine revival. Molecular nanotechnology was viewed as nearly as likely to be technically feasible, and compatible with both pure cryopreservation and aldehyde-based methods. Taken together, these findings delineate current barriers to high-quality preservation, identify future research priorities, and provide baseline estimates for key areas of uncertainty.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices. Current visual BCI systems suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use. Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50% over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding 200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and 103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm. This study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of high-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to create realistic models for brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological realism. Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane voltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network expressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by long-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting non-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term dependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order dynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns beyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of fspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters by solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using adjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph datasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs, achieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training memory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a novel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely applicable to various real-world tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring computational efficiency for real-time applications. Existing methods often oversimplify temporal granularity and spatial hierarchies, limiting accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel framework integrating multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling, and efficient fusion via the Mamba architecture. By segmenting EEG signals across diverse temporal scales and constructing global-local graphs with neuroanatomical priors, MSGM effectively captures fine-grained emotional fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity. A multi-depth Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and token embedding fusion module, paired with Mamba's state-space modeling, enable dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at linear complexity. Notably, with just one MSST-Mamba layer, MSGM surpasses leading methods in the field on the SEED, THU-EP, and FACED datasets, outperforming baselines in subject-independent emotion classification while achieving robust accuracy and millisecond-level inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However, wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data. Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was 76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection, dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1% with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Goal: Epilepsy remains under-diagnosed in low-income countries due to scarce neurologists and costly diagnostic tools. We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Information processing tasks involve complex cognitive mechanisms that are shaped by various factors, including individual goals, prior experience, and system environments. Understanding such behaviors requires a sophisticated and personalized data capture of how one interacts with modern information systems (e.g., web search engines). Passive sensors, such as wearables, capturing physiological and behavioral data, have the potential to provide solutions in this context. This paper presents a novel dataset, SenseSeek, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of consumer-grade sensors in a complex information processing scenario: searching via systems (e.g., search engines), one of the common strategies users employ for information seeking. The SenseSeek dataset comprises data collected from 20 participants, 235 trials of the stimulated search process, 940 phases of stages in the search process, including the realization of Information Need (IN), Query Formulation (QF), Query Submission by Typing (QS-T) or Speaking (QS-S), and Relevance Judgment by Reading (RJ-R) or Listening (RJ-L). The data includes Electrodermal Activities (EDA), Electroencephalogram (EEG), PUPIL, GAZE, and MOTION data, which were captured using consumer-grade sensors. It also contains 258 features extracted from the sensor data, the gaze-annotated screen recordings, and task responses. We validate the usefulness of the dataset by providing baseline analysis on the impacts of different cognitive intents and interaction modalities on the sensor data, and effectiveness of the data in discriminating the search stages. To our knowledge, SenseSeek is the first dataset that characterizes the multiple stages involved in information seeking with physiological signals collected from multiple sensors. We hope this dataset can serve as a reference for future research on information-seeking behaviors.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy detectors.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, noise presents a persistent challenge, often compromising the quality of EEG signals essential for accurate data interpretation. This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for achieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address the issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by non-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line interference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of problematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting (ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify channels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR topographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the impact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery (MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%] (confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions), significantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]). These results underscore the critical role of channel selection and the potential of using blink patterns for detecting bad EEG channels, offering valuable insights for improving real-time or offline BCI systems by reducing noise and enhancing signal quality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices. Current visual BCI systems suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use. Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50% over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding 200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and 103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm. This study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of high-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models. Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.</td>

Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to 4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>(Abridged) Stroke and SCI are conditions that can significantly impact the QoL of survivors in both the physical and psychosocial domains. Both diseases often result in significant motor and sensory impairments that are not fully reversible despite current available therapies. Invasive BCIs have emerged as a promising means to bypass the site of injury and potentially restore motor and sensory function. However, to maximize the utility and participant satisfaction with such technology, participants' willingness to embrace BCIs must be assessed, and placed in context with functional goals and rehabilitative priorities. Hence, we conducted a survey of a cohort of stroke (n=33), SCI (n=37), and both (n=1) participants regarding their receptiveness to invasive ECoG-based BCIs as well as to assess their goals for functional rehabilitation. Overall, participants indicated a high level of willingness to undergo surgery to implant ECoG grids for BCI technology if basic motor functions, including upper extremity, gait, bowel/bladder, and sensory function were restored. There was no correlation between participant willingness to undergo a prospective BCI implantation and the level of functional recovery offered by the BCI. Similarly, there was no correlation between willingness to undergo surgery and the participants' perceived rehabilitative priorities and level of disability. These findings indicate that participants were interested in invasive BCI technology even if only basic functions can be restored, regardless of their level of disability and their rehabilitative priorities. Such observations imply that first generation commercial invasive BCIs may not need extensive functions to garner adoption. Conversely, it also raises a concern that participants from the stroke and SCI cohort may be overly enthusiastic about such technology, which poses potential risks for medical exploitation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain is often studied from a network perspective, where functional activity is assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to estimate connectivity between predefined neuronal regions. Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current methodologies typically integrate biophysical brain models with functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) data - while offering millimeter-scale spatial resolution (0.5-2 mm^3 voxels), these approaches suffer from limited temporal resolution (>0.5 Hz) for tracking rapid neural dynamics during continuous tasks. Conversely, Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides millisecond-scale temporal precision (<=1 ms sampling rate) for real-time guidance of continuous task execution, albeit constrained by low spatial resolution. To reconcile these complementary modalities, we present a generalizable Bayesian inference framework that integrates high-spatial-resolution structural MRI(sMRI) with high-temporal-resolution EEG to construct a biologically realistic digital twin brain(DTB) model. The framework establishes voxel-wise mappings between millisecond-scale EEG and sMRI-derived spiking networks, while demonstrating its translational potential through a brain-inspired autonomous driving simulation. Our EEG-DTB model achieves capabilities: (1) Biologically-plausible EEG signal generation (0.88 resting-state,0.60 task-state correlation), with simulated signals in task-state yielding steering predictions outperforming both chance and empirical signals (p<0.05); (2) Successful autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator using decoded steering angles. The proposed approach pioneers a new paradigm for studying sensorimotor integration and for mechanistic studies of perception-action cycles and the development of brain-inspired control systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such as the one proposed in this paper.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters, prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.</td>

Our results demonstrate that including fiber orientation data significantly improves model accuracy, particularly for a subset of butterfly tumors. These findings highlight the critical role of white matter architecture in tumor spread and suggest that integrating fiber tract information can enhance the precision of radiotherapy target volume delineation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing methods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame and a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these methods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen, achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$), demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2) introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3) comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately, our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved diagnostic processes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above challenges.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics, resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion detection.</td>
