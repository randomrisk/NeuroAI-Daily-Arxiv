<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition, characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This 'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to modeling complex neural population dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments. (2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements.   The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints. Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95% generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of SSVEP for practical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections, leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with 2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by 48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns. Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence.</td>

Using a hierarchical strategy, we divided imaging data from 237 mouse brains into about 13,570,000 standardized blocks, classified into four levels of reconstruction difficulty. With the custom-developed reconstruction platform, we achieved high-precision three-dimensional reconstructions of 9,676 neurons at the whole-brain scale.

Treating stocks as functional nodes and their co-fluctuations as expressions of collective cognition, we introduce dynamic Market Network Connectivity (dMNC), the financial analogue of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC). This biologically inspired framework reveals structurally persistent market subnetworks, captures regime shifts, and uncovers systemic early warning signals all without reliance on predictive labels. Our results suggest that markets, like brains, exhibit modular, self-organizing, and temporally evolving architectures. This work inaugurates the field of financial connectomics, a principled synthesis of systems neuroscience and quantitative finance aimed at uncovering the hidden logic of complex economies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Attention is not monolithic; rather, it operates in multiple forms to facilitate efficient cognitive processing. In the auditory domain, attention enables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be either attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed towards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these modes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural correlates of different attentional modes in a controlled "cocktail party" paradigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a spatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene (global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in the scene. Our findings indicate that object-based attention is more perceptually effective than feature-based or global attention. Furthermore, object-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and are differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up salience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a reduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated. In addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a source-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the object or spatial modes. Overall, the study shows that the perception of the same acoustic scene differs according to the listening task, guided by an interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks, they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene (navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent). Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e., without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found. Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs. informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but offering much greater flexibility</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a 36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials, which reached only 56.9% accuracy.</td>

The challenges of identifying features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes. This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time series forecasting.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG Source localization is a critical tool in neuroscience, with applications ranging from epilepsy diagnosis to cognitive research. It involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem that lacks a unique solution unless constrained by prior knowledge. The Bayesian framework enables the incorporation of such knowledge, typically encoded through prior models. Various algorithms have been proposed for source localization, and they differ significantly in how prior knowledge is incorporated. Some approaches rely on anatomical or functional constraints, while others use statistical distributions or sampling-based techniques. In this landscape, the Standardized Kalman Filter (SKF) represents a dynamic Bayesian approach that integrates temporal modeling with a Gaussian prior structure. It addresses the depth bias, a common limitation in source localization, through a post-hoc standardization step that equalizes sensitivity across cortical depths and makes deep activity detection feasible.   This study focuses on the development and optimization of Gaussian prior models within the SKF framework for simultaneous cortical and sub-cortical activity detection. Synthetic data similar to the P20 / N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) was used to identify effective prior parameter configurations for reconstructing both deep and superficial sources under different noise levels. We also investigated the role of RTS smoothing in enhancing source separability. Our results indicate that raising the standardization exponent to 1.25, along with smoothing, significantly improves depth localization accuracy at low noise levels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB. Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous EEG-fMRI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure, little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO, and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB) while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source our implementation at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tracealign-2DA7</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers can render a new communication channel independent of peripheral nervous system, which are especially valuable for patients with severe motor disabilities. However, current BCI spellers often require users to type intended utterances letter-by-letter while spelling errors grow proportionally due to inaccurate electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding, largely impeding the efficiency and usability of BCIs in real-world communication. In this paper, we present MindChat, a large language model (LLM)-assisted BCI speller to enhance BCI spelling efficiency by reducing users' manual keystrokes. Building upon prompt engineering, we prompt LLMs (GPT-4o) to continuously suggest context-aware word and sentence completions/predictions during spelling. Online copy-spelling experiments encompassing four dialogue scenarios demonstrate that MindChat saves more than 62\% keystrokes and over 32\% spelling time compared with traditional BCI spellers. We envision high-speed BCI spellers enhanced by LLMs will potentially lead to truly practical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model (BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces training time without sacrificing performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification, facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and generalized EEG models.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, noise presents a persistent challenge, often compromising the quality of EEG signals essential for accurate data interpretation. This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for achieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address the issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by non-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line interference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of problematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting (ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify channels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR topographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the impact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery (MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%] (confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions), significantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]). These results underscore the critical role of channel selection and the potential of using blink patterns for detecting bad EEG channels, offering valuable insights for improving real-time or offline BCI systems by reducing noise and enhancing signal quality.</td>

Current visual BCI systems suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use. Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50% over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding 200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and 103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm.

These maps heavily rely on automated methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678 research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They also offer new insights into emerging trends within the BCI-XR field. The source code is available https://github.com/AryaAftab/RATE</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments. (2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs) is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional (e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g., affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied, and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients, but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models. Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts. Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1 score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB. Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous EEG-fMRI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices. Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared representational format between vision and language remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting functional organization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.   Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.   This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction, ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex. Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample composition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values, class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings, achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools. AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI (XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes, cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning experiences and competency assessment.</td>

SNOMED CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making them well-suited for real-world deployment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However, these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or ``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert review.   In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML) methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.   Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight, task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape modeling.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO (Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning. Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9 percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted preference learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements.   The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation.</td>

Existing research shows that pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance. However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities. In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw data only.</td>
