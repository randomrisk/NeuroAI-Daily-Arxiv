<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-invasive stimulation of small, variably shaped brain sub-regions is crucial for advancing our understanding of brain functions. Current ultrasound neuromodulation faces two significant trade-offs when targeting brain sub-regions: miniaturization versus volumetric control and spatial resolution versus transcranial capability. Here, we present an optically-generated Bessel beam ultrasound (OBUS) device designed to overcome these limitations. This 2.33 mm-diameter miniaturized device delivers a column-shaped field achieving a lateral resolution of 152 um and an axial resolution of 1.93 mm, targeting brain sub-regions with an elongated volume of tissue activation. Immunofluorescence imaging of mouse brain slices confirms its ability to stimulate cells at a depth of 2.2 mm. Additionally, OBUS outperforms conventional Gaussian ultrasound in transcranial transmission efficiency and beam shape preservation. Electrophysiological recordings and functional MRI captured rodent brain responses evoked by OBUS, demonstrating OBUS's ability to non-invasively activate neural circuits in intact brains. This technology offers new possibilities for studying brain functions with precision and volumetric control.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuromorphic computing promises to transform AI systems by enabling them to perceive, respond to, and adapt swiftly and accurately to dynamic data and user interactions. However, traditional silicon-based and hybrid electronic technologies for artificial neurons constrain neuromorphic processors in terms of flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the use of Doped-Gain-Layer-on-Waveguide-Synapses for bio-inspired neurons, utilizing a pulsed pump-signal mechanism to enhance neuromorphic computation. This approach addresses critical challenges in scalability and energy efficiency inherent in current technologies.   We introduce the concept of Gain on Waveguide Dynamics for synapses, demonstrating how non-linear pulse transformations of input probe signals occur under various pump-probe configurations. Our findings reveal that primarily properties of pulse amplitude, period as well material properties such as doping densities and population dynamics influence strongly the generation of spiking responses that emulate neuronal behaviour and effectively how computational logic is. By harnessing the complex interactions of asynchronous spiking pump techniques and ion densities in excited states, our method produces event-driven responses that mirror natural neuronal functions. This gain-enhanced environment supports short-term memory capabilities alongside essential characteristics like asynchronous spike generation, threshold operation, and temporal integration, foundational to brain-inspired spiking neural network paradigms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mechanical forces are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their in vivo measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.</td>

<td style='padding: 8px;'>Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2, can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain. This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize multiple lesioned brain images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile, such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes - is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques - time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception, maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain tumor resection is a complex procedure with significant implications for patient survival and quality of life. Predictions of patient outcomes provide clinicians and patients the opportunity to select the most suitable onco-functional balance. In this study, global features derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging in a clinical dataset of 49 pre- and post-surgery patients identified potential biomarkers associated with survival outcomes. We propose a framework that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) with neuroimaging-based feature engineering for survival assessment, offering guidance for surgical decision-making. In this study, we introduce a global explanation optimizer that refines survival-related feature attribution in deep learning models, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Our findings suggest that survival is influenced by alterations in regions associated with cognitive and sensory functions, indicating the importance of preserving areas involved in decision-making and emotional regulation during surgery to improve outcomes. The global explanation optimizer improves both fidelity and comprehensibility of explanations compared to state-of-the-art XAI methods. It effectively identifies survival-related variability, underscoring its relevance in precision medicine for brain tumor treatment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation, hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Undirected graphical models are powerful tools for uncovering complex relationships among high-dimensional variables. This paper aims to fully recover the structure of an undirected graphical model when the data naturally take matrix form, such as temporal multivariate data.   As conventional vector-variate analyses have clear limitations in handling such matrix-structured data, several approaches have been proposed, mostly relying on the likelihood of the Gaussian distribution with a separable covariance structure. Although some of these methods provide theoretical guarantees against false inclusions (i.e. all identified edges exist in the true graph), they may suffer from crucial limitations: (1) failure to detect important true edges, or (2) dependency on conditions for the estimators that have not been verified.   We propose a novel regression-based method for estimating matrix graphical models, based on the relationship between partial correlations and regression coefficients. Adopting the primal-dual witness technique from the regression framework, we derive a non-asymptotic inequality for exact recovery of an edge set. Under suitable regularity conditions, our method consistently identifies the true edge set with high probability.   Through simulation studies, we compare the support recovery performance of the proposed method against existing alternatives. We also apply our method to an electroencephalography (EEG) dataset to estimate both the spatial brain network among 64 electrodes and the temporal network across 256 time points.</td>

In this article, we present a numerically efficient, practically competitive, and theoretically rigorous classification method for distinguishing between two classes of locally stationary time series based on their time-domain, second-order characteristics. Our approach builds on the autoregressive approximation for locally stationary time series, combined with an ensemble aggregation and a distance-based threshold for classification. It imposes no requirement on the training sample size, and is shown to achieve zero misclassification error rate asymptotically when the underlying time series differ only mildly in their second-order characteristics. The new method is demonstrated to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art solutions, including wavelet-based, tree-based, convolution-based methods, as well as modern deep learning methods, through intensive numerical simulations and a real EEG data analysis for epilepsy classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition.</td>

Experiments on the DTU dataset show that using 32 channels yields comparable accuracy to the full 64-channel setup (79.21% vs. 81.06%) on average. In some cases, even 8 channels can deliver satisfactory accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SHAP-AAD in reducing complexity while preserving high detection performance.</td>

By treating EEG as video-like sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy. Beyond classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in real-world clinical settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional video-induced emotion physiological datasets often use whole-trial annotation, assigning a single emotion label to all data collected during an entire trial. This coarse-grained annotation approach misaligns with the dynamic and temporally localized nature of emotional responses as they unfold with video narratives, introducing label noise that limits emotion recognition algorithm evaluation and performance. To solve the label noise problem caused by coarse-grained annotation, we propose a fine-grained annotation method through an immediate recall paradigm. This paradigm integrates an immediate video replay phase after the initial stimulus viewing, allowing participants to precisely mark the onset timestamp, emotion label, and intensity based on their immediate recall. We validate this paradigm through physiological evidence and recognition performance. Physiological validation of multimodal signals within participant-marked windows revealed rhythm-specific EEG patterns and arousal-dependent GSR responses-with SCRs appearing in 91% of high-arousal versus 6% of low-arousal emotion windows. These objective physiological data changes strongly aligned with subjective annotations, confirming annotation precision. For recognition performance, classification experiments showed that models trained on fine-grained annotations achieved 9.7% higher accuracy than traditional whole-trial labeling, despite using less data. This work not only addresses label noise through fine-grained annotation but also demonstrates that annotation precision outweighs data scale in determining emotion recognition performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.</td>

It remains unknown whether non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can support volitional communication in CLIS. Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered "Yes"/"No" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring basic communication in CLIS.</td>

To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in ecological settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI. The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning, and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with similar content and structure from EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems, existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and 2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI) datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How does the information flow between different brain regions during various stimuli? This is the question we aim to address by studying complex cognitive paradigms in terms of Information Theory. To assess creativity and the emergence of patterns from a Shannon perspective, we applied a range of tools, including Entropy Density, Effective Measure Complexity, and the Lempel-Ziv distance. These entropic tools enable the detection of both linear and non-linear dynamics without relying on pre-established parameters, models, or prior assumptions about the data. To identify connections between different brain regions, we analyse task-based fMRI data from subjects during motor, working memory, emotion recognition, and language stimuli to gain insight into these complex cognitive processes. Since this method does not rely on prior knowledge, it is particularly well-suited for exploratory research, facilitating the discovery of previously unidentified connections or patterns in the brain. The capacity to identify non-linear dynamics is especially important for studying brain connectivity, as the brain exhibits significant non-linear interactions across multiple functional levels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods, including recent hypergraph-based techniques.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress, reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states. Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis of metastability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale neural mass models have been widely used to simulate resting-state brain activity from structural connectivity. In this work, we extend a well-established Wilson--Cowan framework by introducing a novel hemispheric-specific coupling scheme that differentiates between intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric structural interactions. We apply this model to empirical cortical connectomes and resting-state fMRI data from matched control and schizophrenia groups. Simulated functional connectivity is computed from the band-limited envelope correlations of regional excitatory activity and compared against empirical functional connectivity matrices. Our results show that incorporating hemispheric asymmetries enhances the correlation between simulated and empirical functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of anatomically-informed coupling strategies in improving the biological realism of large-scale brain network models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However, existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be made publicly available at this https://github.com/arunkumar-kannan/BrainMT-fMRI</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human languages differ widely in their forms, each having distinct sounds, scripts, and syntax. Yet, they can all convey similar meaning. Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks. This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks. HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes associated with neurocognitive decline.</td>

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</td>

Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions, particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.</td>

Among its most promising applications is the restoration of communication to paralysed individuals affected by speech deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the conditions for an "ImageNet moment" or breakthrough in non-invasive neural decoding, by harnessing the collective power of the machine learning community.   To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset recorded to date (LibriBrain) together with a user-friendly Python library (pnpl) for easy data access and integration with deep learning frameworks. For the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Edge-Geodetic Sets play a crucial role in network monitoring and optimization, wherein the goal is to strategically place monitoring stations on vertices of a network, represented as a graph, to ensure complete coverage of edges and mitigate faults by monitoring lines of communication. This paper illustrates and explores the Monitoring Edge-Geodetic Set (MEG-set) problem, which involves determining the minimum set of vertices that need to be monitored to achieve geodetic coverage for a given network. The significance of this problem lies in its potential to facilitate efficient network monitoring, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of various applications. In this work, we prove the $\mathcal{NP}$-completeness of the MEG-set optimization problem by showing a reduction from the well-known Vertex Cover problem. Furthermore, we present inapproximability results, proving that the MEG-set optimization problem is $\mathcal{APX}$-Hard and that, if the unique games conjecture holds, the problem is not approximable within a factor of $2-\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. Despite its $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm achieving an approximation ratio of $O(\sqrt{|V(G)| \cdot \ln{|V(G)|})}$ for the MEG-set optimization problem, based on the well-known Set Cover approximation algorithm, where $|V(G)|$ is the number of nodes of the MEG-set instance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Subjective well-being is a key metric in economic, medical, and policy decision-making. As artificial intelligence provides scalable tools for modelling human outcomes, it is crucial to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict well-being across diverse global populations. We evaluate four leading LLMs using data from 64,000 individuals in 64 countries. While LLMs capture broad correlates such as income and health, their predictive accuracy decreases in countries underrepresented in the training data, highlighting systematic biases rooted in global digital and economic inequality. A pre-registered experiment demonstrates that LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic similarity rather than conceptual understanding, leading to systematic misestimations in unfamiliar or resource-limited settings. Injecting findings from underrepresented contexts substantially enhances performance, but a significant gap remains. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in predicting global well-being, underscoring the importance of robust validation prior to their implementation across these areas.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline, from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone. Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15 \textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for clinical translation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy. Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs. Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate the images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Pediatric medical imaging presents unique challenges due to significant anatomical and developmental differences compared to adults. Direct application of segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal performance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address these challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been proposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult, pediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including the network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric, or mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning method (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT (Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer learning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on segmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric CT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a commercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides actionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments reveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned with pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation, especially when segmenting fine structures-and that continual learning strategies mitigate institutional shifts, thus enhancing generalization across diverse pediatric datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/ICANS-Strasbourg/PSAT.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge: models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging. Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy, but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes. Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent, clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover 15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods. These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Trans-spinal FUS (tsFUS) has recently been shown promise in modulating spinal reflexes in rodents, opening new avenues for spinal cord interventions in motor control and pain management. However, anatomical differences between rodents and human spinal cords require careful targeting strategies and transducer design adaptations for human applications. Aim: This study aims to computationally explore the feasibility of tsFUS in the human spinal cord by leveraging the intervertebral acoustic window and vertebral lamina. Method: Acoustic simulations were performed using an anatomically detailed human spinal cord model with an adapted single-element focusing transducer (SEFT) to investigate the focality and intensity of the acoustic quantities generated within the spinal cord. Results: Sonication through the intervertebral acoustic window using an adapted transducer achieved approximately 2-fold higher intensity and up to 20% greater beam overlap compared to commercial SEFT. Precise transducer positioning was critical; a 10 mm vertical shift resulted in a reduction of target intensity by approximately 7-fold. The vertebral level also substantially influenced the sonication outcomes, with the thoracic spine achieving 6-fold higher intensity than the cervical level. Sonication through the vertebral lamina resulted in approximately 2.5-fold higher intraspinal intensity in the cervical spine. Conclusion and Significance: This study presents the first systematic, anatomically realistic computational model for the feasibility of tsFUS in humans. Quantifying the trade-offs between acoustic path, vertebral level, and transducer geometry offers foundational design and procedural guidelines for the design and safety of spinal FUS protocols, supporting future studies of trans-spinal FUS in humans.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visualizing 3D medical images is challenging due to self-occlusion, where anatomical structures of interest can be obscured by surrounding tissues. Existing methods, such as slicing and interactive clipping, are limited in their ability to fully represent internal anatomy in context. In contrast, hand-drawn medical illustrations in anatomy books manage occlusion effectively by selectively removing portions based on tissue type, revealing 3D structures while preserving context. This paper introduces AnatomyCarve, a novel technique developed for a VR environment that creates high-quality illustrations similar to those in anatomy books, while remaining fast and interactive. AnatomyCarve allows users to clip selected segments from 3D medical volumes, preserving spatial relations and contextual information. This approach enhances visualization by combining advanced rendering techniques with natural user interactions in VR. Usability of AnatomyCarve was assessed through a study with non-experts, while surgical planning effectiveness was evaluated with practicing neurosurgeons and residents. The results show that AnatomyCarve enables customized anatomical visualizations, with high user satisfaction, suggesting its potential for educational and clinical applications.</td>
