<td style='padding: 4px;'>Combining brightness and nanoscale size of short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters is equally essential in the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, but such nano-emitters are still lacking. Here we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with lengths much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in solubilized carbon nanotubes. The observed NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After being made biocompatible, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with luminescent color centers open the route toward point-spread function engineering and 3-dimensional single-particle studies for nanoscale NIR-II imaging in thick brain tissue.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor, poses major challenges due to its poor prognosis and high morbidity rates. Partial differential equation-based models offer promising potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes by simulating patient-specific tumor behavior for improved radiotherapy planning. However, model calibration remains a bottleneck due to the high computational demands of optimization methods like Monte Carlo sampling and evolutionary algorithms. To address this, we recently introduced an approach leveraging a neural forward solver with gradient-based optimization to significantly reduce calibration time. This approach requires a highly accurate and fully differentiable forward model. We investigate multiple architectures, including (i) an enhanced TumorSurrogate, (ii) a modified nnU-Net, and (iii) a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT). The optimized TumorSurrogate achieved the best overall results, excelling in both tumor outline matching and voxel-level prediction of tumor cell concentration. It halved the MSE relative to the baseline model and achieved the highest Dice score across all tumor cell concentration thresholds. Our study demonstrates significant enhancement in forward solver performance and outlines important future research directions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The development of EEG decoding algorithms confronts challenges such as data sparsity, subject variability, and the need for precise annotations, all of which are vital for advancing brain-computer interfaces and enhancing the diagnosis of diseases. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage approach named Self-Supervised State Reconstruction-Primed Riemannian Dynamics (EEG-ReMinD) , which mitigates reliance on supervised learning and integrates inherent geometric features. This approach efficiently handles EEG data corruptions and reduces the dependency on labels. EEG-ReMinD utilizes self-supervised and geometric learning techniques, along with an attention mechanism, to analyze the temporal dynamics of EEG features within the framework of Riemannian geometry, referred to as Riemannian dynamics. Comparative analyses on both intact and corrupted datasets from two different neurodegenerative disorders underscore the enhanced performance of EEG-ReMinD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is pivotal for achieving optimal performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, while full fine-tuning delivers superior results, it entails significant computational and resource costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, address these challenges by reducing the number of trainable parameters, but they often struggle with rank adjustment efficiency and task-specific adaptability. We propose Triangular Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (TriAdaptLoRA), a novel PEFT framework inspired by neuroscience principles, which dynamically optimizes the allocation of trainable parameters. TriAdaptLoRA introduces three key innovations: 1) a triangular split of transformation matrices into lower and upper triangular components to maximize parameter utilization, 2) a parameter importance metric based on normalized Frobenius norms for efficient adaptation, and 3) an adaptive rank-growth strategy governed by dynamic thresholds, allowing flexible parameter allocation across training steps. Experiments conducted on a variety of natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that TriAdaptLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods. It achieves superior performance, enhanced stability, and reduced computational overhead, particularly under linear threshold-driven rank growth. These results highlight its efficacy as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, large models, such as Vision Transformer and BERT, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their extensive computational requirements lead to considerable power and hardware resource consumption. Brain-inspired computing, characterized by its spike-driven methods, has emerged as a promising approach for low-power hardware implementation. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse hardware accelerator for Spike-driven Transformer. We first design a novel encoding method that encodes the position information of valid activations and skips non-spike values. This method enables us to use encoded spikes for executing the calculations of linear, maxpooling and spike-driven self-attention. Compared with the single spike input design of conventional SNN accelerators that primarily focus on convolution-based spiking computations, the specialized module for spike-driven self-attention is unique in its ability to handle dual spike inputs. By exclusively utilizing activated spikes, our design fully exploits the sparsity of Spike-driven Transformer, which diminishes redundant operations, lowers power consumption, and minimizes computational latency. Experimental results indicate that compared to existing SNNs accelerators, our design achieves up to 13.24$\times$ and 1.33$\times$ improvements in terms of throughput and energy efficiency, respectively.</td>

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</td>

XR enhances ecological validity while enabling real-time, multimodal data collection through tools such as galvanic skin response (GSR), electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), hand tracking, and body tracking. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive and emotional processes, as well as adaptive, personalized interventions for users. Despite these advancements, current XR applications often underutilize the full potential of multimodal integration, relying primarily on visual and auditory inputs. Challenges such as cybersickness, usability concerns, and accessibility barriers further limit the widespread adoption of XR tools in cognitive science and clinical practice. This review examines XR-based cognitive assessment and training, focusing on its advantages over traditional methods, including ecological validity, engagement, and adaptability. It also explores unresolved challenges such as system usability, cost, and the need for multimodal feedback integration. The review concludes by identifying opportunities for optimizing XR tools to improve cognitive evaluation and rehabilitation outcomes, particularly for diverse populations, including older adults and individuals with cognitive impairments.</td>

However, most studies rely on highly controlled laboratory environments with scripted stimuli. Here, we examine the audio visual benefit using unscripted, natural speech from untrained speakers within a virtual acoustic environment. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and cortical speech tracking, we assessed neural responses across audio visual, audio only, visual only, and masked lip conditions to isolate the role of lip movements. Additionally, we analysed individual differences in acoustic and visual features of the speakers, including pitch, jitter, and lip openness, to explore their influence on the audio visual speech tracking benefit. Results showed a significant audio visual enhancement in speech tracking with background noise, with the masked lip condition performing similarly to the audio-only condition, emphasizing the importance of lip movements in adverse listening situations. Our findings reveal the feasibility of cortical speech tracking with naturalistic stimuli and underscore the impact of individual speaker characteristics on audio-visual integration in real world listening contexts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In modeling musical surprisal expectancy with computational methods, it has been proposed to use the information content (IC) of one-step predictions from an autoregressive model as a proxy for surprisal in symbolic music. With an appropriately chosen model, the IC of musical events has been shown to correlate with human perception of surprise and complexity aspects, including tonal and rhythmic complexity. This work investigates whether an analogous methodology can be applied to music audio. We train an autoregressive Transformer model to predict compressed latent audio representations of a pretrained autoencoder network. We verify learning effects by estimating the decrease in IC with repetitions. We investigate the mean IC of musical segment types (e.g., A or B) and find that segment types appearing later in a piece have a higher IC than earlier ones on average. We investigate the IC's relation to audio and musical features and find it correlated with timbral variations and loudness and, to a lesser extent, dissonance, rhythmic complexity, and onset density related to audio and musical features. Finally, we investigate if the IC can predict EEG responses to songs and thus model humans' surprisal in music. We provide code for our method on github.com/sonycslparis/audioic.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The resting-state brain networks (RSNs) reflects the functional connectivity patterns between brain modules, providing essential foundations for decoding intrinsic neural information within the brain. It serves as one of the primary tools for describing the spatial dynamics of the brain using various neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the distribution rules or potential modes of functional connectivity weights in the resting state remain unclear. In this context, we first start from simulation, using forward solving model to generate scalp EEG with four channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128). Subsequently, we construct scalp brain networks using five coupling measures, aiming to explore whether different channel density or coupling measures affect the distribution pattern of functional connectivity weights. Next, we quantify the distribution pattern by calculating the skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy of the functional connectivity network weights. Finally, the results of the simulation were validated in a normative database. We observed that: 1) The functional connection weights exhibit a right-skewed distribution, and are not influenced by channel density or coupling measures; 2) The functional connection weights exhibit a relatively uniform distribution, with the potential for volume conduction to affect the degree of uniformity in the distribution; 3) Networks constructed using coupling measures influenced by volume conduction exhibit significant correlations between the average connection weight and measures of skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of RSNs, providing valuable insights for research in the field of neuroscience, and holds promise for being associated with brain cognition and disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Biometric authentication is increasingly popular for its convenience and accuracy. However, while recent advancements focus on reducing errors and expanding modalities, the reliability of reported performance metrics often remains overlooked. Understanding reliability is critical, as it communicates how accurately reported error rates represent a system's actual performance, considering the uncertainty in error-rate estimates from test data. Currently, there is no widely accepted standard for reporting these uncertainties and indeed biometric studies rarely provide reliability estimates, limiting comparability and interpretation. To address this gap, we introduce BioQuake--a measure to estimate uncertainty in biometric verification systems--and empirically validate it on four systems and three datasets. Based on BioQuake, we provide simple guidelines for estimating performance uncertainty and facilitating reliable reporting. Additionally, we apply BioQuake to analyze biometric recognition performance on 62 biometric datasets used in research across eight modalities: face, fingerprint, gait, iris, keystroke, eye movement, Electroencephalogram (EEG), and Electrocardiogram (ECG). Our analysis shows that reported state-of-the-art performance often deviates significantly from actual error rates, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions. To support researchers and foster the development of more reliable biometric systems and datasets, we release BioQuake as an easy-to-use web tool for reliability calculations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question "what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain--computer interfaces are groundbreaking technology whereby brain signals are used to control external devices. Despite some advances in recent years, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor-imagery tasks face challenges, such as amplitude and phase variability and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller models and faster inference. In this study, we develop a prototype, called the Lightweight Geometric Learning Brain--Computer Interface (LGL-BCI), which uses our customized geometric deep learning architecture for swift model inference without sacrificing accuracy.

Meanwhile, a built-in lossless transformation helps boost the inference speed. The performance of our solution was evaluated using two real-world EEG devices and two public EEG datasets. LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency. These findings underscore both the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of LGL-BCI, demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of geometric deep learning in motor-imagery brain--computer interface applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor execution, a fundamental aspect of human behavior, has been extensively studied using BCI technologies. EEG and fNIRS have been utilized to provide valuable insights, but their individual limitations have hindered performance. This study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying rest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI dataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a multimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional Additive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging convolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in multimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a computationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a hybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from separate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate that MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities (EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than EEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with embedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and OD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data. This work highlights the potential of deep learning, specifically MECASA, to enhance EEG-fNIRS fusion for BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding has emerged as a rapidly advancing and extensively utilized technique within neuroscience. This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question "what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer numerous human-centered application possibilities, particularly affecting people with neurological disorders. Text or speech decoding from brain activities is a relevant domain that could augment the quality of life for people with impaired speech perception. We propose a novel approach to enhance listened speech decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by utilizing an auxiliary phoneme predictor that simultaneously decodes textual phoneme sequences. The proposed model architecture consists of three main parts: EEG module, speech module, and phoneme predictor. The EEG module learns to properly represent EEG signals into EEG embeddings. The speech module generates speech waveforms from the EEG embeddings. The phoneme predictor outputs the decoded phoneme sequences in text modality. Our proposed approach allows users to obtain decoded listened speech from EEG signals in both modalities (speech waveforms and textual phoneme sequences) simultaneously, eliminating the need for a concatenated sequential pipeline for each modality. The proposed approach also outperforms previous methods in both modalities. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding speech from non-invasive brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), has the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), with applications in silent communication and assistive technologies for individuals with speech impairments. However, EEG-based speech decoding faces major challenges, such as noisy data, limited datasets, and poor performance on complex tasks like speech perception. This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) facilitate high-throughput target image detection by identifying event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked in EEG signals. The RSVP-BCI systems effectively detect single-class targets within a stream of images but have limited applicability in scenarios that require detecting multiple target categories. Multi-class RSVP-BCI systems address this limitation by simultaneously identifying the presence of a target and distinguishing its category. However, existing multi-class RSVP decoding algorithms predominantly rely on single-modality EEG decoding, which restricts their performance improvement due to the high similarity between ERPs evoked by different target categories. In this work, we introduce eye movement (EM) modality into multi-class RSVP decoding and explore EEG and EM fusion to enhance decoding performance. First, we design three independent multi-class target RSVP tasks and build an open-source dataset comprising EEG and EM signals from 43 subjects. Then, we propose the Multi-class Target RSVP EEG and EM fusion Network (MTREE-Net) to enhance multi-class RSVP decoding. Specifically, a dual-complementary module is proposed to strengthen the differentiation of uni-modal features across categories. To improve multi-modal fusion performance, we adopt a dynamic reweighting fusion strategy guided by theoretically derived modality contribution ratios. Furthermore, we reduce the misclassification of non-target samples through knowledge transfer between two hierarchical classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of integrating EM signals into multi-class RSVP decoding and highlight the superior performance of MTREE-Net compared to existing RSVP decoding methods. The proposed MTREE-Net and open-source dataset provide a promising framework for developing practical multi-class RSVP-BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is an effective technology used for information detection by detecting Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). The current RSVP decoding methods can perform well in decoding EEG signals within a single RSVP task, but their decoding performance significantly decreases when directly applied to different RSVP tasks without calibration data from the new tasks. This limits the rapid and efficient deployment of RSVP-BCI systems for detecting different categories of targets in various scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this study aims to enhance the cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding performance. First, we design three distinct RSVP tasks for target image retrieval and build an open-source dataset containing EEG signals and corresponding stimulus images. Then we propose an EEG with Language-Image Prior fusion Transformer (ELIPformer) for cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding. Specifically, we propose a prompt encoder based on the language-image pre-trained model to extract language-image features from task-specific prompts and stimulus images as prior knowledge for enhancing EEG decoding. A cross bidirectional attention mechanism is also adopted to facilitate the effective feature fusion and alignment between the EEG and language-image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding, which promotes the RSVP-BCI system from research to practical application.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hemispheric strokes impair motor control in contralateral body parts, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies. Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Complex systems are characterized by nonlinear dynamics, multi-level interactions, and emergent collective behaviors. Traditional analyses that focus solely on pairwise interactions often oversimplify these systems, neglecting the higher-order interactions critical for understanding their full collective dynamics. Recent advances in multivariate information theory provide a principled framework for quantifying these higher-order interactions, capturing key properties such as redundancy, synergy, shared randomness, and collective constraints. However, two major challenges persist: accurately estimating joint entropies and addressing the combinatorial explosion of interacting terms. To overcome these challenges, we introduce THOI (Torch-based High-Order Interactions), a novel, accessible, and efficient Python library for computing high-order interactions in continuous-valued systems. THOI leverages the well-established Gaussian copula method for joint entropy estimation, combined with state-of-the-art batch and parallel processing techniques to optimize performance across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments. Our results demonstrate that THOI significantly outperforms existing tools in terms of speed and scalability. For larger systems, where exhaustive analysis is computationally impractical, THOI integrates optimization strategies that make higher-order interaction analysis feasible. We validate THOI accuracy using synthetic datasets with parametrically controlled interactions and further illustrate its utility by analyzing fMRI data from human subjects in wakeful resting states and under deep anesthesia. Finally, we analyzed over 900 real-world and synthetic datasets, establishing a comprehensive framework for applying higher-order interaction (HOI) analysis in complex systems.</td>

However, the current captioning approach introduces the challenge of potential data contamination given that the GIT model was trained on the COCO dataset. In this work, we present an alternative method for decoding brain signals into image captions by predicting a DINOv2 model's embedding of an image from the corresponding fMRI signal and then providing its [CLS] token as the prefix to the GPT-2 language model which decreases computational requirements considerably.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The quantitative formulation of evolution equations is the backbone for prediction, control, and understanding of dynamical systems across diverse scientific fields. Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding aims to reconstruct original stimuli from fMRI signals, providing insights into interpreting mental content. Current approaches rely heavily on subject-specific models due to the complex brain processing mechanisms and the variations in fMRI signals across individuals. Therefore, these methods greatly limit the generalization of models and fail to capture cross-subject commonalities. To address this, we present UniBrain, a unified brain decoding model that requires no subject-specific parameters. Our approach includes a group-based extractor to handle variable fMRI signal lengths, a mutual assistance embedder to capture cross-subject commonalities, and a bilevel feature alignment scheme for extracting subject-invariant features. We validate our UniBrain on the brain decoding benchmark, achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art subject-specific models with extremely fewer parameters. We also propose a generalization benchmark to encourage the community to emphasize cross-subject commonalities for more general brain decoding.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This Dissertation is comprised of two main projects, addressing questions in neuroscience through applications of generative modeling.   Project #1 (Chapter 4) explores how neurons encode features of the external world. I combine Helmholtz's "Perception as Unconscious Inference" -- paralleled by modern generative models like variational autoencoders (VAE) -- with the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. This combination leads to the development of a hierarchical VAE model, which I test for its ability to mimic neurons from the primate visual cortex in response to motion stimuli. Results show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate brain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion inputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner. Collectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding.   Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using simultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates that the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with around half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities. Comparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from fMRI and Ca2+ signals.   The introduction (Chapter 1) is divided similarly to this abstract: sections 1.1 to 1.8 provide background information about Project #1, and sections 1.9 to 1.13 are related to Project #2. Chapter 2 includes historical background, Chapter 3 provides the necessary mathematical background, and finally, Chapter 6 contains concluding remarks and future directions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) is commonly employed to study human brain activity, since it offers insight into the relationship between functional fluctuations and human behavior. To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders, with significant impacts on many daily activities and quality of life. It stands as one of the most common mental disorders globally and ranks as the second leading cause of disability. The current diagnostic approach for MDD primarily relies on clinical observations and patient-reported symptoms, overlooking the diverse underlying causes and pathophysiological factors contributing to depression. Therefore, scientific researchers and clinicians must gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MDD. There is growing evidence in neuroscience that depression is a brain network disorder, and the use of neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a significant role in identifying and treating MDD. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques used to study MDD. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to neuroimaging data to help with early mental health disorder detection. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in graph neural networks (GNNs), which are deep neural architectures specifically designed to handle graph-structured data like rs-fMRI. This research aimed to develop an ensemble-based GNN model capable of detecting discriminative features from rs-fMRI images for the purpose of diagnosing MDD. Specifically, we constructed an ensemble model by combining features from multiple brain region segmentation atlases to capture brain complexity and detect distinct features more accurately than single atlas-based models. Further, the effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by assessing its performance on a large multi-site MDD dataset. The best performing model among all folds achieved an accuracy of 75.80%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 61.84%, a precision of 71.29%, and an F1-score of 79.12%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques in multi-view settings face significant challenges, particularly when integrating heterogeneous data, aligning feature spaces, and managing view-specific biases. These issues are prominent in neuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are analyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), where signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's underlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are assumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View Independent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across subjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual variability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a temporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory stimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays alone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to differ across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a model with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in closed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms existing multi-view ICA methods. We further validate its effectiveness using the Cam-CAN dataset, and showing how delays and dilations are related to aging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The resting-state brain networks (RSNs) reflects the functional connectivity patterns between brain modules, providing essential foundations for decoding intrinsic neural information within the brain. It serves as one of the primary tools for describing the spatial dynamics of the brain using various neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the distribution rules or potential modes of functional connectivity weights in the resting state remain unclear. In this context, we first start from simulation, using forward solving model to generate scalp EEG with four channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128). Subsequently, we construct scalp brain networks using five coupling measures, aiming to explore whether different channel density or coupling measures affect the distribution pattern of functional connectivity weights. Next, we quantify the distribution pattern by calculating the skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy of the functional connectivity network weights. Finally, the results of the simulation were validated in a normative database. We observed that: 1) The functional connection weights exhibit a right-skewed distribution, and are not influenced by channel density or coupling measures; 2) The functional connection weights exhibit a relatively uniform distribution, with the potential for volume conduction to affect the degree of uniformity in the distribution; 3) Networks constructed using coupling measures influenced by volume conduction exhibit significant correlations between the average connection weight and measures of skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of RSNs, providing valuable insights for research in the field of neuroscience, and holds promise for being associated with brain cognition and disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent experimental results from the Atomki collaboration have reported the observation of anomalous effects in Beryllium, Helium and Carbon nuclear transitions that could hint at physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the MEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the Beryllium transition ${^8}\text{Be}^\star\to{^8}\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of this result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations of the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$ with mass around $17\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of a spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was initially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous signal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the SINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon anomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\% to 54.88\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning has recently enabled the decoding of language from the neural activity of a few participants with electrodes implanted inside their brain. However, reliably decoding words from non-invasive recordings remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language.</td>

MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables.

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep Learning for medical imaging faces challenges in adapting and generalizing to new contexts. Additionally, it often lacks sufficient labeled data for specific tasks requiring significant annotation effort. Continual Learning (CL) tackles adaptability and generalizability by enabling lifelong learning from a data stream while mitigating forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Active Learning (AL) reduces the number of required annotations for effective training. This work explores both approaches (CAL) to develop a novel framework for robust medical image analysis. Based on the automatic recognition of shifts in image characteristics, Replay-Base Architecture for Context Adaptation (RBACA) employs a CL rehearsal method to continually learn from diverse contexts, and an AL component to select the most informative instances for annotation. A novel approach to evaluate CAL methods is established using a defined metric denominated IL-Score, which allows for the simultaneous assessment of transfer learning, forgetting, and final model performance. We show that RBACA works in domain and class-incremental learning scenarios, by assessing its IL-Score on the segmentation and diagnosis of cardiac images. The results show that RBACA outperforms a baseline framework without CAL, and a state-of-the-art CAL method across various memory sizes and annotation budgets.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Hand-specific localization has garnered significant interest within the computer vision community. Although there are numerous datasets with hand annotations from various angles and settings, domain transfer techniques frequently struggle in surgical environments. This is mainly due to the limited availability of gloved hand instances and the unique challenges of operating rooms (ORs). Thus, hand-detection models tailored to OR settings require extensive training and expensive annotation processes. To overcome these challenges, we present "RoHan" - a novel approach for robust hand detection in the OR, leveraging advanced semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques to tackle the challenges of varying recording conditions, diverse glove colors, and occlusions common in surgical settings. Our methodology encompasses two main stages: (1) data augmentation strategy that utilizes "Artificial Gloves," a method for augmenting publicly available hand datasets with synthetic images of hands-wearing gloves; (2) semi-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that improves detection performance in real-world OR settings through iterative prediction refinement and efficient frame filtering. We evaluate our method using two datasets: simulated enterotomy repair and saphenous vein graft harvesting. "RoHan" substantially reduces the need for extensive labeling and model training, paving the way for the practical implementation of hand detection technologies in medical settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim-hardware.

Despite adeptly handling a broad spectrum of healthcare inquiries, these models face significant challenges in delivering accurate and practical advice for chronic conditions such as diabetes. We evaluate the responses of ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4 to diabetes patient queries, assessing their depth of medical knowledge and their capacity to deliver personalized, context-specific advice for diabetes self-management. Our findings reveal discrepancies in accuracy and embedded biases, emphasizing the models' limitations in providing tailored advice unless activated by sophisticated prompting techniques. Additionally, we observe that both models often provide advice without seeking necessary clarification, a practice that can result in potentially dangerous advice. This underscores the limited practical effectiveness of these models without human oversight in clinical settings. To address these issues, we propose a commonsense evaluation layer for prompt evaluation and incorporating disease-specific external memory using an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation technique. This approach aims to improve information quality and reduce misinformation risks, contributing to more reliable AI applications in healthcare settings. Our findings seek to influence the future direction of AI in healthcare, enhancing both the scope and quality of its integration.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Soft tissue manipulation is an integral aspect of most surgical procedures; however, the vast majority of surgical graspers used today are made of hard materials, such as metals or hard plastics. Furthermore, these graspers predominately function by pinching tissue between two hard objects as a method for tissue manipulation. As such, the potential to apply too much force during contact, and thus damage tissue, is inherently high. As an alternative approach, gaspers developed using a pneumatic vortex could potentially levitate soft tissue, enabling manipulation with low or even no contact force. In this paper, we present the design and well as a full factorial study of the force characteristics of the vortex gripper grasping soft surfaces with four common shapes, with convex and concave curvature, and ranging over 10 different radii of curvature, for a total of 40 unique surfaces. By changing the parameters of the nozzle elements in the design of the gripper, it was possible to investigate the influence of the mass flow parameters of the vortex gripper on the lifting force for all of these different soft surfaces. An $\pmb{ex}$ $\pmb{vivo}$ experiment was conducted on grasping biological tissues and soft balls of various shapes to show the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed technology. The obtained results allowed us to find limitations in the use of vortex technology and the following stages of its improvement for medical use.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying optimal medical treatments to improve survival has long been a critical goal of pharmacoepidemiology. Traditionally, we use an average treatment effect measure to compare outcomes between treatment plans. However, new methods leveraging advantages of machine learning combined with the foundational tenets of causal inference are offering an alternative to the average treatment effect. Here, we use three unique, precision medicine algorithms (random forests, residual weighted learning, efficient augmentation relaxed learning) to identify optimal treatment rules where patients receive the optimal treatment as indicated by their clinical history. First, we present a simple hypothetical example and a real-world application among heart failure patients using Medicare claims data. We next demonstrate how the optimal treatment rule improves the absolute risk in a hypothetical, three-modifier setting. Finally, we identify an optimal treatment rule that optimizes the time to outcome in a real-world heart failure setting. In both examples, we compare the average time to death under the optimized, tailored treatment rule with the average time to death under a universal treatment rule to show the benefit of precision medicine methods. The improvement under the optimal treatment rule in the real-world setting is greatest (additional ~9 days under the tailored rule) for survival time free of heart failure readmission.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sclera segmentation is crucial for developing automatic eye-related medical computer-aided diagnostic systems, as well as for personal identification and verification, because the sclera contains distinct personal features. Deep learning-based sclera segmentation has achieved significant success compared to traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features, primarily because it can autonomously extract critical output-related features without the need to consider potential physical constraints. However, achieving accurate sclera segmentation using these methods is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality, fully labeled datasets, which depend on costly, labor-intensive medical acquisition and expertise. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel sclera segmentation framework that excels with limited labeled samples. Specifically, we employ a semi-supervised learning method that integrates domain-specific improvements and image-based spatial transformations to enhance segmentation performance. Additionally, we have developed a real-world eye diagnosis dataset to enrich the evaluation process. Extensive experiments on our dataset and two additional public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method, especially with significantly fewer labeled samples.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automated chest radiographs interpretation requires both accurate disease classification and detailed radiology report generation, presenting a significant challenge in the clinical workflow. Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.
