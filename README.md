<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current methodologies typically integrate biophysical brain models with functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) data - while offering millimeter-scale spatial resolution (0.5-2 mm^3 voxels), these approaches suffer from limited temporal resolution (>0.5 Hz) for tracking rapid neural dynamics during continuous tasks. Conversely, Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides millisecond-scale temporal precision (<=1 ms sampling rate) for real-time guidance of continuous task execution, albeit constrained by low spatial resolution. To reconcile these complementary modalities, we present a generalizable Bayesian inference framework that integrates high-spatial-resolution structural MRI(sMRI) with high-temporal-resolution EEG to construct a biologically realistic digital twin brain(DTB) model. The framework establishes voxel-wise mappings between millisecond-scale EEG and sMRI-derived spiking networks, while demonstrating its translational potential through a brain-inspired autonomous driving simulation. Our EEG-DTB model achieves capabilities: (1) Biologically-plausible EEG signal generation (0.88 resting-state,0.60 task-state correlation), with simulated signals in task-state yielding steering predictions outperforming both chance and empirical signals (p<0.05); (2) Successful autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator using decoded steering angles. The proposed approach pioneers a new paradigm for studying sensorimotor integration and for mechanistic studies of perception-action cycles and the development of brain-inspired control systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article addresses the challenge of adapting data-based models over time. We propose a novel two-fold modelling architecture designed to correct plant-model mismatch caused by two types of uncertainty. Out-of-domain uncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in the initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from real-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To handle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the human brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored operating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems it necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a combination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical proximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and (ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises the ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of a new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain uncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast thinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the slow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP) model, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding older samples. The proposed methodology is tested on a benchmark energy system referenced in the literature, demonstrating that the combined use of slow and fast learning components improves model accuracy compared to standard adaptation approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain tumor classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such as the one proposed in this paper.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding, which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to 4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses, Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun), and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this result.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</td>

This paper examines the neural mechanisms behind aesthetic experiences, aiming to explain why certain designs or artworks feel emotionally or cognitively "right." By analyzing the interaction between perception, emotion, and cognition, neuroaesthetics reveals how beauty is constructed in the brain and how this understanding can inform fields such as graphic and interface design. This paper offers a clear and accessible overview of core neuroaesthetic principles, making the subject approachable to a wide audience. The findings suggest that impactful design is more than surface-level appeal: well-crafted visual experiences can engage, support, and connect people in meaningful ways.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency. Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.</td>

Thirty-eight healthy adults were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 20), which completed two sessions spaced two weeks apart with daily breathing practice, or a control group (n = 18), which completed one session. In each session, participants underwent an auditory EEG assessment with resting, mental load, and startle conditions. The intervention group also completed a guided breathing session during the first visit and practiced the technique between sessions. EEG biomarkers (ST4, Alpha, Delta, Gamma, VC0) and subjective anxiety levels (STAI) were assessed before and after the intervention. A significant reduction in Gamma power was observed in the intervention group immediately following the first breathing session during mental load (p = .002), indicating acute stress reduction. Across sessions, long-term breathing practice led to increased Alpha and Delta power and reduced ST4 activity, suggesting cumulative improvements in emotional regulation and cognitive efficiency. Correlational analyses revealed that changes in VC0 and Alpha were significantly associated with subjective reports of tension, focus difficulty, and calmness. Guided slow-paced breathing at a 5:5 rhythm produces both immediate and sustained effects on neural markers of stress and cognition, with corresponding improvements in subjective anxiety. These findings support EEG-based monitoring as a scalable method for evaluating breath-based interventions and promoting real-time emotional self-regulation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying neural markers of stress and cognitive load is key to developing scalable tools for mental state assessment. This study evaluated whether a single-channel high-density EEG (hdrEEG) system could dissociate cognitive and stress-related activity during a brief auditory task-based protocol. Sixty-eight healthy adults completed resting state recordings, cognitively demanding auditory tasks, and exposure to unpredictable literalized startle stimuli. Participants also rated their stress and anxiety using a modified State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). EEG analysis focused on frequency bands (Theta, Gamma, Delta) and machine-learning-derived features (A0, ST4, VC9, T2). A double dissociation emerged: Theta and VC9 increased under cognitive load but not startle, supporting their sensitivity to executive function. In contrast, Gamma and A0 were elevated by the startle stimulus, consistent with stress reactivity. ST4 tracked cognitive effort and worry, while T2 negatively correlated with self-reported calmness, indicating relevance to emotional regulation. These results demonstrate that a short, uniform assessment using portable EEG can yield multiple reliable biomarkers of cognitive and affective states. The findings have implications for clinical, occupational, and educational settings, and may inform future neurofeedback protocols targeting simultaneous regulation of attention and stress.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding, which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to 4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world applications.</td>

However, decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel 5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking, (4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic alignment and image quality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>(Abridged) Stroke and SCI are conditions that can significantly impact the QoL of survivors in both the physical and psychosocial domains. Both diseases often result in significant motor and sensory impairments that are not fully reversible despite current available therapies. Invasive BCIs have emerged as a promising means to bypass the site of injury and potentially restore motor and sensory function. However, to maximize the utility and participant satisfaction with such technology, participants' willingness to embrace BCIs must be assessed, and placed in context with functional goals and rehabilitative priorities. Hence, we conducted a survey of a cohort of stroke (n=33), SCI (n=37), and both (n=1) participants regarding their receptiveness to invasive ECoG-based BCIs as well as to assess their goals for functional rehabilitation. Overall, participants indicated a high level of willingness to undergo surgery to implant ECoG grids for BCI technology if basic motor functions, including upper extremity, gait, bowel/bladder, and sensory function were restored. There was no correlation between participant willingness to undergo a prospective BCI implantation and the level of functional recovery offered by the BCI. Similarly, there was no correlation between willingness to undergo surgery and the participants' perceived rehabilitative priorities and level of disability. These findings indicate that participants were interested in invasive BCI technology even if only basic functions can be restored, regardless of their level of disability and their rehabilitative priorities. Such observations imply that first generation commercial invasive BCIs may not need extensive functions to garner adoption. Conversely, it also raises a concern that participants from the stroke and SCI cohort may be overly enthusiastic about such technology, which poses potential risks for medical exploitation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).   We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current methodologies typically integrate biophysical brain models with functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) data - while offering millimeter-scale spatial resolution (0.5-2 mm^3 voxels), these approaches suffer from limited temporal resolution (>0.5 Hz) for tracking rapid neural dynamics during continuous tasks. Conversely, Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides millisecond-scale temporal precision (<=1 ms sampling rate) for real-time guidance of continuous task execution, albeit constrained by low spatial resolution. To reconcile these complementary modalities, we present a generalizable Bayesian inference framework that integrates high-spatial-resolution structural MRI(sMRI) with high-temporal-resolution EEG to construct a biologically realistic digital twin brain(DTB) model. The framework establishes voxel-wise mappings between millisecond-scale EEG and sMRI-derived spiking networks, while demonstrating its translational potential through a brain-inspired autonomous driving simulation. Our EEG-DTB model achieves capabilities: (1) Biologically-plausible EEG signal generation (0.88 resting-state,0.60 task-state correlation), with simulated signals in task-state yielding steering predictions outperforming both chance and empirical signals (p<0.05); (2) Successful autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator using decoded steering angles. The proposed approach pioneers a new paradigm for studying sensorimotor integration and for mechanistic studies of perception-action cycles and the development of brain-inspired control systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such as the one proposed in this paper.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</td>

While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviors; however, objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain lacking. We propose a coevolutionary balance paradigm that quantifies network level energy via a Hamiltonian integrating regional activity measured by fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and resting state functional connectivity (FC). Analysis of resting state fMRI data from 93 adult males with ASD and 93 matched controls revealed that empirical networks showed lower energy than 1000 topology preserving null models (paired t = -4.12, p less than or equal to 1e-4). Participants with ASD exhibited more negative whole brain energy (t = -3.239, p = 0.0015), driven by increased agreement links and reduced imbalanced same motifs. Subnetwork analysis indicated greater energy in the Default Mode Network after false discovery rate correction (p less than 0.016) and enhanced energy between the Default Mode, Salience and Dorsal Attention networks (p less than 0.032). Energy metrics and inter network connectivity correlated with Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule severity scores (absolute correlation greater than or equal to 0.29, p less than 0.02). A k nearest neighbors classifier using nine principal features including motif proportions, global node link alignment, inter network fALFF weighted and FC strengths, subnetwork magnetization and pairwise energy achieved an accuracy of 79 percent with balanced sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate that coevolutionary energy detects interpretable network disruptions and establishes a robust framework for ASD classification.</td>

CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative (THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories. We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been commonly used to construct functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of the human brain. TFCNs are primarily limited to quantifying pairwise relationships between ROIs ignoring higher order dependencies between multiple brain regions. Recently, hypergraph construction methods from fMRI time series data have been proposed to characterize the high-order relations among multiple ROIs. While there have been multiple methods for constructing hypergraphs from fMRI time series, the question of how to characterize the topology of these hypergraphs remains open. In this paper, we make two key contributions to the field of community detection in brain hypernetworks. First, we construct a hypergraph for each subject capturing high order dependencies between regions. Second, we introduce a spectral clustering based approach on hypergraphs to detect overlapping community structure. Finally, the proposed method is implemented to detect the consensus community structure across multiple subjects. The proposed method is applied to resting state fMRI data from Human Connectome Project to summarize the overlapping community structure across a group of healthy young adults.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying what aspects of brain activity are responsible for conscious perception remains one of the most challenging problems in science. While progress has been made through psychophysical studies employing EEG and fMRI, research would greatly benefit from improved methods for stimulating the brain in healthy human subjects. Traditional techniques for neural stimulation through the skull, including electrical or magnetic stimulation, suffer from coarse spatial resolution and have limited ability to target deep brain structures with high spatial selectivity. Over the past decade, a new tool has emerged known as transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which enables the human brain to be stimulated safely and non-invasively through the skull with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, including cortical as well as deep brain structures. This tool offers an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs in consciousness research. Given the extensive preparation and regulatory approvals associated with tFUS testing, careful experimental planning is essential. Therefore, our goal here is to provide a roadmap for using tFUS in humans for exploring the neural substrate of conscious perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Historically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has focused primarily on gray matter, particularly the cortical gray matter and associated nuclei. However, recent work has demonstrated that functional activity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and learning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global patterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled exploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical harmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via GitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the source code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized version of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple public datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of functional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high angular resolution functional correlations. The key innovation of this work is the containerized implementation, which we have made available under a permissive open-source license to support reproducible and accessible research practices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the sub-cellular level.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P). Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited, textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR), Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation (DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features. DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally, experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Acquiring medical expertise is a critical component of medical education and professional development. While existing studies focus primarily on constructing medical knowledge bases or developing learning tools based on the structured, private healthcare data, they often lack methods for extracting expertise from unstructured medical texts. These texts constitute a significant portion of medical literature and offer greater flexibility and detail compared to structured data formats. Furthermore, many studies fail to provide explicit analytical and learning pathways in this context.   This paper introduces MExplore, an interactive visual analytics system designed to support the acquisition of medical expertise. To address the challenges of the inconsistencies and confidentiality concerns inherent in unstructured medical texts, we propose a workflow that employs a fine-tuned BERT-based model to extract medical entities (MEs) from them. We then present a novel multilevel visual analysis framework that integrates multiple coordinated visualizations, enabling a progressive and interactive exploration of medical knowledge.   To assess the effectiveness of MExplore, we conducted three case studies, a user study, and interviews with domain experts. The results indicate that the system significantly enhances the medical expertise acquisition process, providing an effective interactive approach for acquiring and retaining knowledge from medical texts.</td>

However, current approaches for designing eligibility criteria have limitations to support interactive exploration of the large space of eligibility criteria. They also ignore incorporating detailed characteristics from the original electronic health record (EHR) data for criteria refinement. To address these limitations, we proposed TrialCompass, a visual analytics system integrating a novel workflow, which can empower clinicians to iteratively explore the vast space of eligibility criteria through knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches. TrialCompass supports history-tracking to help clinicians trace the evolution of their adjustments and decisions when exploring various forms of data (i.e., eligibility criteria, outcome metrics, and detailed characteristics of original EHR data) through these two approaches. This feature can help clinicians comprehend the impact of eligibility criteria on outcome metrics and patient characteristics, which facilitates systematic refinement of eligibility criteria. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TrialCompass in providing insights into designing eligibility criteria for septic shock and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We also discussed the research prospects of applying visual analytics to clinical trials.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen, domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM), a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain, paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical practice.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optical fiber-based platforms are increasingly explored as compact, minimally invasive tools for integrated photonic functionalities in biomedical applications. Among these, the combination of plasmonic heating and optical sensing on a single fiber tip offers compelling opportunities for localized photothermal actuation and in situ molecular detection. In this work, we present a multifunctional plasmonic fiber probe (PFP) that enables spectral multiplexing of thermo-plasmonic heating and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). This dual capability is achieved by integrating gold nanoislands (AuNIs) onto the flat facet of a multimode optical fiber using a solid-state dewetting process - a straightforward and scalable fabrication method that avoids the complexity of lithographic techniques. We characterize how the morphology of the AuNIs modulates optical extinction, photothermal response, and electromagnetic field enhancement across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Specifically, we demonstrate efficient, wavelength-dependent heating under visible light and strong SERS signal enhancement under near-infrared excitation, both supported by electromagnetic and thermal simulations. The ability to decouple photothermal stimulation and Raman sensing in a single, fiber-integrated device addresses a current gap in lab-on-fiber technologies, where multifunctional operation is often constrained to a single wavelength.</td>

Our method can be seamlessly integrated into segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at https://github.com/StudioYG/Med-OoD.</td>
