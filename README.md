<td style='padding: 4px;'>To date, most dendritic studies have predominantly focused on the apical zone of pyramidal two-point neurons (TPNs) receiving only feedback (FB) connections from higher perceptual layers and using them for learning. Recent cellular neurophysiology and computational neuroscience studies suggests that the apical input (context), coming from feedback and lateral connections, is multifaceted and far more diverse, with greater implications for ongoing learning and processing in the brain than previously realized. In addition to the FB, the apical tuft receives signals from neighboring cells of the same network as proximal (P) context, other parts of the brain as distal (D) context, and overall coherent information across the network as universal (U) context. The integrated context (C) amplifies and suppresses the transmission of coherent and conflicting feedforward (FF) signals, respectively. Specifically, we show that complex context-sensitive (CS)-TPNs flexibly integrate C moment-by-moment with the FF somatic current at the soma such that the somatic current is amplified when both feedforward (FF) and C are coherent; otherwise, it is attenuated. This generates the event only when the FF and C currents are coherent, which is then translated into a singlet or a burst based on the FB information. Spiking simulation results show that this flexible integration of somatic and contextual currents enables the propagation of more coherent signals (bursts), making learning faster with fewer neurons. Similar behavior is observed when this functioning is used in conventional artificial networks, where orders of magnitude fewer neurons are required to process vast amounts of heterogeneous real-world audio-visual (AV) data trained using backpropagation (BP). The computational findings presented here demonstrate the universality of CS-TPNs, suggesting a dendritic narrative that was previously overlooked.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, AI research has primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), and increasing accuracy often involves scaling up and consuming more power. The power consumption of AI has become a significant societal issue; in this context, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution. SNNs operate event-driven, like the human brain, and compress information temporally. These characteristics allow SNNs to significantly reduce power consumption compared to perceptron-based artificial neural networks (ANNs), highlighting them as a next-generation neural network technology. However, societal concerns regarding AI go beyond power consumption, with the reliability of AI models being a global issue. For instance, adversarial attacks on AI models are a well-studied problem in the context of traditional neural networks. Despite their importance, the stability and property verification of SNNs remains in the early stages of research. Most SNN verification methods are time-consuming and barely scalable, making practical applications challenging. In this paper, we introduce temporal encoding to achieve practical performance in verifying the adversarial robustness of SNNs. We conduct a theoretical analysis of this approach and demonstrate its success in verifying SNNs at previously unmanageable scales. Our contribution advances SNN verification to a practical level, facilitating the safer application of SNNs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research on algorithms and control methods for distributed collaborative robots. However, the emergence of collective behavior in a swarm is still difficult to predict and control. Nevertheless, human interaction with the swarm helps render the swarm more predictable and controllable, as human operators can utilize intuition or knowledge that is not always available to the swarm. Therefore, this paper designs the Dynamic Visualization Research Platform for Multimodal Human-Swarm Interaction (DVRP-MHSI), which is an innovative open system that can perform real-time dynamic visualization and is specifically designed to accommodate a multitude of interaction modalities (such as brain-computer, eye-tracking, electromyographic, and touch-based interfaces), thereby expediting progress in human-swarm interaction research. Specifically, the platform consists of custom-made low-cost omnidirectional wheeled mobile robots, multitouch screens and two workstations. In particular, the mutitouch screens can recognize human gestures and the shapes of objects placed on them, and they can also dynamically render diverse scenes. One of the workstations processes communication information within robots and the other one implements human-robot interaction methods. The development of DVRP-MHSI frees researchers from hardware or software details and allows them to focus on versatile swarm algorithms and human-swarm interaction methods without being limited to fixed scenarios, tasks, and interfaces. The effectiveness and potential of the platform for human-swarm interaction studies are validated by several demonstrative experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dementia is a neurological syndrome marked by cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Previous studies have utilized various EEG features, such as subband power and connectivity patterns to differentiate these conditions. However, artifacts in EEG signals can obscure crucial information, necessitating advanced signal processing techniques. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. The study utilizes scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to check for the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (comprising AD, FTD, and healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (including subjects with AD, MCI, and HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes on both datasets. The best results were achieved by using a product of probabilities from classifiers for left and right subcortical regions in conjunction with the DenseNet model architecture. It yields accuracies of 94.17$\%$ and 77.72$\%$ on the BrainLat and IITD-AIIA datasets, respectively. This highlights the potential of this approach for early and accurate differentiation of neurodegenerative disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Whole-body CT is used for multi-trauma patients in the search of any and all injuries. Since an initial assessment needs to be rapid and the search for lesions is done for the whole body, very little time can be allocated for the inspection of a specific anatomy. In particular, intracranial hemorrhages are still missed, especially by clinical students. In this work, we present a Deep Learning approach for highlighting such lesions to improve the diagnostic accuracy. While most works on intracranial hemorrhages perform segmentation, detection only requires bounding boxes for the localization of the bleeding. In this paper, we propose a novel Voxel-Complete IoU (VC-IoU) loss that encourages the network to learn the 3D aspect ratios of bounding boxes and leads to more precise detections. We extensively experiment on brain bleeding detection using a publicly available dataset, and validate it on a private cohort, where we achieve 0.877 AR30, 0.728 AP30, and 0.653 AR30, 0.514 AP30 respectively. These results constitute a relative +5% improvement in Average Recall for both datasets compared to other loss functions. Finally, as there is little data currently publicly available for 3D object detection and as annotation resources are limited in the clinical setting, we evaluate the cost of different annotation methods, as well as the impact of imprecise bounding boxes in the training data on the detection performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The challenge of Multimodal Deformable Image Registration (MDIR) lies in the conversion and alignment of features between images of different modalities. Generative models (GMs) cannot retain the necessary information enough from the source modality to the target one, while non-GMs struggle to align features across these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine MDIR framework,LLM-Morph, which is applicable to various pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve these concerns by aligning the deep features from different modal medical images. Specifically, we first utilize a CNN encoder to extract deep visual features from cross-modal image pairs, then we use the first adapter to adjust these tokens, and use LoRA in pre-trained LLMs to fine-tune their weights, both aimed at eliminating the domain gap between the pre-trained LLMs and the MDIR task. Third, for the alignment of tokens, we utilize other four adapters to transform the LLM-encoded tokens into multi-scale visual features, generating multi-scale deformation fields and facilitating the coarse-to-fine MDIR task. Extensive experiments in MR-CT Abdomen and SR-Reg Brain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the potential of pre-trained LLMs for MDIR task.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) has emerged as a powerful approach in neuroimaging research, utilized in over 7,000 studies since the year 2000. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, VBM assesses variations in the local density of brain tissue and examines its associations with biological and psychometric variables. Here, we present deepmriprep, a neural network-based pipeline that performs all necessary preprocessing steps for VBM analysis of T1-weighted MR images using deep neural networks. Utilizing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), deepmriprep is 37 times faster than CAT12, the leading VBM preprocessing toolbox. The proposed method matches CAT12 in accuracy for tissue segmentation and image registration across more than 100 datasets and shows strong correlations in VBM results. Tissue segmentation maps from deepmriprep have over 95% agreement with ground truth maps, and its non-linear registration, using supervised SYMNet, predicts smooth deformation fields comparable to CAT12. The high processing speed of deepmriprep enables rapid preprocessing of extensive datasets and thereby fosters the application of VBM analysis to large-scale neuroimaging studies and opens the door to real-time applications. Finally, deepmripreps straightforward, modular design enables researchers to easily understand, reuse, and advance the underlying methods, fostering further advancements in neuroimaging research. deepmriprep can be conveniently installed as a Python package and is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wwu-mmll/deepmriprep.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce Scaffold Prompt Tuning (ScaPT), a novel prompt-based framework for adapting large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pre-trained models to downstream tasks, with high parameter efficiency and improved performance compared to fine-tuning and baselines for prompt tuning. The full fine-tuning updates all pre-trained parameters, which may distort the learned feature space and lead to overfitting with limited training data which is common in fMRI fields. In contrast, we design a hierarchical prompt structure that transfers the knowledge learned from high-resource tasks to low-resource ones. This structure, equipped with a Deeply-conditioned Input-Prompt (DIP) mapping module, allows for efficient adaptation by updating only 2% of the trainable parameters. The framework enhances semantic interpretability through attention mechanisms between inputs and prompts, and it clusters prompts in the latent space in alignment with prior knowledge. Experiments on public resting state fMRI datasets reveal ScaPT outperforms fine-tuning and multitask-based prompt tuning in neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis/prognosis and personality trait prediction, even with fewer than 20 participants. It highlights ScaPT's efficiency in adapting pre-trained fMRI models to low-resource tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The widespread application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has significantly influenced the development of new therapeutic agents. These computational methods can be used to design and predict the properties of generated molecules. Multi-target Drug Discovery (MTDD) is an emerging paradigm for discovering drugs against complex disorders that do not respond well to more traditional target-specific treatments, such as central nervous system, immune system, and cardiovascular diseases. Still, there is yet to be an established benchmark suite for assessing the effectiveness of AI tools for designing multi-target compounds. Standardized benchmarks allow for comparing existing techniques and promote rapid research progress. Hence, this work proposes an evaluation framework for molecule generation techniques in MTDD scenarios, considering brain diseases as a case study. Our methodology involves using large language models to select the appropriate molecular targets, gathering and preprocessing the bioassay datasets, training quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict target modulation, and assessing other essential drug-likeness properties for implementing the benchmarks. Additionally, this work will assess the performance of four deep generative models and evolutionary algorithms over our benchmark suite. In our findings, both evolutionary algorithms and generative models can achieve competitive results across the proposed benchmarks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we introduce LightCNN, a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification using EEG data. LightCNN's strength lies in its simplicity, utilizing just a single convolutional layer. Embracing Leonardo da Vinci's principle that "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," LightCNN demonstrates that complexity is not required to achieve outstanding results. We benchmarked LightCNN against several state-of-the-art deep learning models known for their effectiveness in EEG-based PD classification. Remarkably, LightCNN outperformed all these complex architectures, with a 2.3% improvement in recall, a 4.6% increase in precision, a 0.1% edge in AUC, a 4% boost in F1-score, and a 3.3% higher accuracy compared to the closest competitor. Furthermore, LightCNN identifies known pathological brain rhythms associated with PD and effectively captures clinically relevant neurophysiological changes in EEG. Its simplicity and interpretability make it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded systems for EEG analysis. In conclusion, LightCNN represents a significant step forward in efficient EEG-based PD classification, demonstrating that a well-designed, lightweight model can achieve superior performance over more complex architectures. This work underscores the potential for minimalist models to meet the needs of modern healthcare applications, particularly where resources are limited.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals has garnered widespread attention in recent years. However, existing studies have struggled to develop a sufficiently generalized model suitable for different datasets without re-training (cross-corpus). This difficulty arises because distribution differences across datasets far exceed the intra-dataset variability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling (SCMM) framework. Inspired by emotional continuity, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a new hybrid masking strategy to effectively mine the "short-term continuity" characteristics inherent in human emotions. During the self-supervised learning process, soft weights are assigned to sample pairs, enabling adaptive learning of similarity relationships across samples. Furthermore, we introduce an aggregator that weightedly aggregates complementary information from multiple close samples based on pairwise similarities among samples to enhance fine-grained feature representation, which is then used for original sample reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP datasets show that SCMM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming the second-best method by an average accuracy of 4.26% under two types of cross-corpus conditions (same-class and different-class) for EEG-based emotion recognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interpretable classification of time series presents significant challenges in high dimensions. Traditional feature selection methods in the frequency domain often assume sparsity in spectral density matrices (SDMs) or their inverses, which can be restrictive for real-world applications. In this article, we propose a model-based approach for classifying high-dimensional stationary time series by assuming sparsity in the difference between inverse SDMs. Our approach emphasizes the interpretability of model parameters, making it especially suitable for fields like neuroscience, where understanding differences in brain network connectivity across various states is crucial. The estimators for model parameters demonstrate consistency under appropriate conditions. We further propose using standard deep learning optimizers for parameter estimation, employing techniques such as mini-batching and learning rate scheduling. Additionally, we introduce a method to screen the most discriminatory frequencies for classification, which exhibits the sure screening property under general conditions. The flexibility of the proposed model allows the significance of covariates to vary across frequencies, enabling nuanced inferences and deeper insights into the underlying problem. The novelty of our method lies in the interpretability of the model parameters, addressing critical needs in neuroscience. The proposed approaches have been evaluated on simulated examples and the `Alert-vs-Drowsy' EEG dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Principal component analysis has been a main tool in multivariate analysis for estimating a low dimensional linear subspace that explains most of the variability in the data. However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates of the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.</td>

Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sleep plays a crucial role in neonatal development. Monitoring the sleep patterns in neonates in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is imperative for understanding the maturation process. While polysomnography (PSG) is considered the best practice for sleep classification, its expense and reliance on human annotation pose challenges. Existing research often relies on multichannel EEG signals; however, concerns arise regarding the vulnerability of neonates and the potential impact on their sleep quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to neonatal sleep stage classification using a single-channel gradient boosting algorithm with Hjorth features. The gradient boosting parameters are fine-tuned using random search cross-validation (randomsearchCV), achieving an accuracy of 82.35% for neonatal sleep-wake classification. Validation is conducted through 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed algorithm not only enhances existing neonatal sleep algorithms but also opens avenues for broader applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Integrating physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG), with other data such as interview audio, may offer valuable multimodal insights into psychological states or neurological disorders. Recent advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) position them as prospective ``health agents'' for mental health assessment. However, current research predominantly focus on single data modalities, presenting an opportunity to advance understanding through multimodal data. Our study aims to advance this approach by investigating multimodal data using LLMs for mental health assessment, specifically through zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Three datasets are adopted for depression and emotion classifications incorporating EEG, facial expressions, and audio (text). The results indicate that multimodal information confers substantial advantages over single modality approaches in mental health assessment. Notably, integrating EEG alongside commonly used LLM modalities such as audio and images demonstrates promising potential. Moreover, our findings reveal that 1-shot learning offers greater benefits compared to zero-shot learning methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Driving under drowsy conditions significantly escalates the risk of vehicular accidents. Although recent efforts have focused on using electroencephalography to detect drowsiness, helping prevent accidents caused by driving in such states, seamless human-machine interaction in driving scenarios requires a more versatile EEG-based system. This system should be capable of understanding a driver's intention while demonstrating resilience to artifacts induced by sudden movements. This paper pioneers a novel research direction in BCI-assisted driving, studying the neural patterns related to driving intentions and presenting a novel method for driving intention prediction. In particular, our preliminary analysis of the EEG signal using independent component analysis suggests a close relation between the intention of driving maneuvers and the neural activities in central-frontal and parietal areas. Power spectral density analysis at a group level also reveals a notable distinction among various driving intentions in the frequency domain. To exploit these brain dynamics, we propose a novel Masked EEG Modeling framework for predicting human driving intentions, including the intention for left turning, right turning, and straight proceeding. Extensive experiments, encompassing comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments on public dataset, demonstrate the proposed method is proficient in predicting driving intentions across various vigilance states. Specifically, our model attains an accuracy of 85.19% when predicting driving intentions for drowsy subjects, which shows its promising potential for mitigating traffic accidents related to drowsy driving. Notably, our method maintains over 75% accuracy when more than half of the channels are missing or corrupted, underscoring its adaptability in real-life driving.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text.</td>

While traditional approaches to automatic emotion recognition have focused on decontextualized signals, recent research emphasizes the importance of context in shaping emotion perceptions. This paper contributes to the emerging field of context-based emotion recognition by leveraging psychological theories of human emotion perception to inform the design of automated methods. We propose an approach that combines emotion recognition methods with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) to integrate emotion inferences from decontextualized facial expressions and contextual knowledge inferred via Large-language Models. We test this approach in the context of interpreting facial expressions during a social task, the prisoner's dilemma. Our results provide clear support for BCI across a range of automatic emotion recognition methods. The best automated method achieved results comparable to human observers, suggesting the potential for this approach to advance the field of affective computing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces Dareplane, a modular and broad technology agnostic open source software platform for brain-computer interface research with an application focus on adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS). While the search for suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last two decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same pace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads. In addition, the full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment.</td>

Decoding linguistic representations in the evoked brain has shown groundbreaking achievements, thanks to the rapid improvement of neuroimaging, medical technology, life sciences and artificial intelligence. In this work, we present a taxonomy of brain-to-language decoding of both textual and speech formats. This work integrates two types of research: neuroscience focusing on language understanding and deep learning-based brain decoding. Generating discernible language information from brain activity could not only help those with limited articulation, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients but also open up a new way for the next generation's brain-computer interface (BCI).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical tool in neuroscience and clinical practice for monitoring and analyzing brain activity. Traditional neural network models, such as EEGNet, have achieved considerable success in decoding EEG signals but often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of the data. Recent advances in quantum computing present new opportunities to enhance machine learning models through quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. In this paper, we introduce Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a novel hybrid neural network that integrates quantum computing with the classical EEGNet architecture to improve EEG encoding and analysis, as a forward-looking approach, acknowledging that the results might not always surpass traditional methods but it shows its potential. QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise. Our results highlight the significant potential of quantum-enhanced neural networks in EEG analysis, suggesting new directions for both research and practical applications in the field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a means to convert neural signals into control signals, providing a potential restoration of movement for people with paralysis. Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Over recent decades, neuroimaging tools, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), have revolutionized our understanding of the brain and its functions. EEG is extensively used in traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and high temporal resolution. This makes it invaluable for identifying different brain states relevant to both medical and non-medical applications. Although this practice is widely recognized, current methods are mainly confined to lab or clinical environments because they rely on data from multiple EEG electrodes covering the entire head. Nonetheless, a significant advancement for these applications would be their adaptation for "real-world" use, using portable devices with a single-channel. In this study, we tackle this challenge through two distinct strategies: the first approach involves training models with data from multiple channels and then testing new trials on data from a single channel individually. The second method focuses on training with data from a single channel and then testing the performances of the models on data from all the other channels individually. To efficiently classify cognitive tasks from EEG data, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with only a few parameters and fast learnable spectral-temporal features. We demonstrated the feasibility of these approaches on EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks from three datasets. We achieved the highest accuracies of 100%, 91.55% and 73.45% in binary and 3-class classification on specific channels across three datasets. This study can contribute to the development of single-channel BCI and provides a robust EEG biomarker for brain states classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the human brain and external systems by utilizing brain signals, eliminating the need for conventional communication methods such as speaking, writing, or typing. Nevertheless, the continuous generation of brain signals in BCI frameworks poses challenges for efficient storage and real-time transmission. While considering the human brain as a semantic source, the meaningful information associated with cognitive activities often gets obscured by substantial noise present in acquired brain signals, resulting in abundant redundancy. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal brain-computer semantic communication paradigm, named EidetiCom, for decoding visual perception under limited-bandwidth constraint. The framework consists of three hierarchical layers, each responsible for compressing the semantic information of brain signals into representative features. These low-dimensional compact features are transmitted and converted into semantically meaningful representations at the receiver side, serving three distinct tasks for decoding visual perception: brain signal-based visual classification, brain-to-caption translation, and brain-to-image generation, in a scalable manner. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm facilitates the semantic communication under low bit rate conditions ranging from 0.017 to 0.192 bits-per-sample, achieving high-quality semantic reconstruction and highlighting its potential for efficient storage and real-time communication of brain recordings in BCI applications, such as eidetic memory storage and assistive communication for patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce Scaffold Prompt Tuning (ScaPT), a novel prompt-based framework for adapting large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pre-trained models to downstream tasks, with high parameter efficiency and improved performance compared to fine-tuning and baselines for prompt tuning. The full fine-tuning updates all pre-trained parameters, which may distort the learned feature space and lead to overfitting with limited training data which is common in fMRI fields. In contrast, we design a hierarchical prompt structure that transfers the knowledge learned from high-resource tasks to low-resource ones. This structure, equipped with a Deeply-conditioned Input-Prompt (DIP) mapping module, allows for efficient adaptation by updating only 2% of the trainable parameters. The framework enhances semantic interpretability through attention mechanisms between inputs and prompts, and it clusters prompts in the latent space in alignment with prior knowledge. Experiments on public resting state fMRI datasets reveal ScaPT outperforms fine-tuning and multitask-based prompt tuning in neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis/prognosis and personality trait prediction, even with fewer than 20 participants. It highlights ScaPT's efficiency in adapting pre-trained fMRI models to low-resource tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mammalian functional architecture flexibly adapts, transitioning from integration where information is distributed across the cortex, to segregation where information is focal in densely connected communities of brain regions. This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role.</td>

This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum Control Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are designed to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively. Our method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum mechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals, such as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical methods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable and less prone to overfitting than the classical methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a currently incurable neurodegeneartive disease. Accurately detecting AD, especially in the early stage, represents a high research priority. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairments that are related to alterations in brain functional connectivity (FC). Based on this association, many studies have been published over the decades using FC and machine learning to differentiate AD from healthy aging. The most recent development in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network (GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack of spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI. The proposed multi-level generated connectome (MLC) based graph convolutional network (GCN) (MLC-GCN) contains a multi-graph generation block and a GCN prediction block. The multi-graph generation block consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature extraction layers for extracting spatio-temporal rsfMRI features at different depths and building the corresponding connectomes. The GCN prediction block takes the learned multi-level connectomes to build and optimize GCNs at each level and concatenates the learned graphical features as the final predicting features for AD classification. Through independent cohort validations, MLC-GCN shows better performance for differentiating MCI, AD, and normal aging than state-of-art GCN and rsfMRI based AD classifiers. The proposed MLC-GCN also showed high explainability in terms of learning clinically reasonable connectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets. While we only tested MLC-GCN on AD, the basic rsfMRI-based multi-level learned GCN based outcome prediction strategy is valid for other diseases or clinical outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research, accurately predicting imagined stimuli is crucial. This study investigates the effectiveness of Domain Adaptation (DA) in enhancing imagery prediction using primarily visual data from fMRI scans of 18 subjects. Initially, we train a baseline model on visual stimuli to predict imagined stimuli, utilizing data from 14 brain regions. We then develop several models to improve imagery prediction, comparing different DA methods. Our results demonstrate that DA significantly enhances imagery prediction, especially with the Regular Transfer approach. We then conduct a DA-enhanced searchlight analysis using Regular Transfer, followed by permutation-based statistical tests to identify brain regions where imagery decoding is consistently above chance across subjects. Our DA-enhanced searchlight predicts imagery contents in a highly distributed set of brain regions, including the visual cortex and the frontoparietal cortex, thereby outperforming standard cross-domain classification methods. The complete code and data for this paper have been made openly available for the use of the scientific community.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern Machine Learning (ML) has significantly advanced various research fields, but the opaque nature of ML models hinders their adoption in several domains. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this challenge by providing additional information to help users understand the internal decision-making process of ML models. In the field of neuroscience, enriching a ML model for brain decoding with attribution-based XAI techniques means being able to highlight which brain areas correlate with the task at hand, thus offering valuable insights to domain experts. In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the "StudyForrest" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the "Forrest Gump" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can provide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation theory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses from asymptomatic changes to clinical symptoms, emphasizing the importance of early detection for proper treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), particularly dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC), has emerged as an important biomarker for AD. Nevertheless, studies probing at-risk subjects in the pre-symptomatic stage using dFNC are limited. To identify at-risk subjects and understand alterations of dFNC in different stages, we leverage deep learning advancements and introduce a transformer-convolution framework for predicting at-risk subjects based on dFNC, incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention to capture brain network dependencies and temporal dynamics. Our model significantly outperforms other popular machine learning methods. By analyzing individuals with diagnosed AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we studied the AD progression and observed a higher similarity between MCI and asymptomatic AD. The interpretable analysis highlights the cognitive-control network's diagnostic importance, with the model focusing on intra-visual domain dFNC when predicting asymptomatic AD subjects.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in understanding the brain's functional organization related to behavior have been pivotal, particularly in the development of predictive models based on brain connectivity. Traditional methods in this domain often involve a two-step process by first constructing a connectivity matrix from predefined brain regions, and then linking these connections to behaviors or clinical outcomes. However, these approaches with unsupervised node partitions predict outcomes inefficiently with independently established connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the Supervised Brain Parcellation (SBP), a brain node parcellation scheme informed by the downstream predictive task. With voxel-level functional time courses generated under resting-state or cognitive tasks as input, our approach clusters voxels into nodes in a manner that maximizes the correlation between inter-node connections and the behavioral outcome, while also accommodating intra-node homogeneity. We rigorously evaluate the SBP approach using resting-state and task-based fMRI data from both the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our analyses show that SBP significantly improves out-of-sample connectome-based predictive performance compared to conventional step-wise methods under various brain atlases. This advancement holds promise for enhancing our understanding of brain functional architectures with behavior and establishing more informative network neuromarkers for clinical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</td>

This study utilized bibliometric methods to explore and analyze the progress, hotspots and developmental trends in international MEG research spanning from 1995 to 2022. The results indicated a dynamic and steady growth trend in the overall number of publications in MEG. Ryusuke Kakigi emerged as the most prolific author, while Neuroimage led as the most prolific journal. Current hotspots in MEG research encompass resting state, networks, functional connectivity, phase dynamics, oscillation, and more. Future trends in MEG research are poised to advance across three key aspects: disease treatment and practical applications, experimental foundations and technical advancements, and fundamental and advanced human cognition. In the future, there should be a focus on enhancing cross-integration and utilization of MEG with other instruments to diversify research methodologies in this field</td>

Utilizing stacked \Chandra/\ACISS\ \MEG\ and \LETG\ spectra toward QSO sightlines, we employ the self-consistent hybrid ionization code PHASE to model our data. The stacked spectra are optimally described by three distinct gas phase components: a \warm\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 5.5), \warmhot\ (\logT\ $\sim 6$), and \hot\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 7.5) components. These findings confirm the presence of the \hot\ component in the MW's CGM indicating its coexistence with a \warm\ and a \warmhot\ gas phases. We find this \hot\ component to be homogeneous in temperature but inhomogeneous in column density. The gas in the \hot\ component requires over-abundances relative to solar to be consistent with the Dispersion Measure (DM) from the Galactic halo reported in the literature. {For the hot phase we estimated a DM = $55.1^{+29.9}_{-23.7}$ pc cm$^{-3}$}. We conclude that this phase is either enriched in Oxygen, Silicon, and Sulfur, or has metallicity {over 6} times solar value, or a combination of both. We do not detect Fe L-shell absorption lines, implying O/Fe $\geq$ 4. The non-solar abundance ratios found in the super-virial gas component in the Galactic halo suggest that this phase arises from Galactic feedback.</td>

We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Higher-order properties of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) induced connectivity have been shown to unravel many exclusive topological and dynamical insights beyond pairwise interactions. Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A novel paradigm of mobile edge generation (MEG)-enabled digital twin (DT) is proposed, which enables distributed on-device generation at mobile edge networks for real-time DT applications. First, an MEG-DT architecture is put forward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto edge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low latency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>New medical treatment development requires multiple phases of clinical trials. Despite the significant human and financial costs of bringing a drug to market, less than 20% of drugs in testing will make it from the first phase to final approval. Recent literature indicates that the design of the trial protocols significantly contributes to trial performance. We investigated Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction (CTOP) using trial design documents to predict phase transitions automatically. We propose CTP-LLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based model for CTOP. We also introduce the PhaseTransition (PT) Dataset; which labels trials based on their progression through the regulatory process and serves as a benchmark for CTOP evaluation. Our fine-tuned GPT-3.5-based model (CTP-LLM) predicts clinical trial phase transition by analyzing the trial's original protocol texts without requiring human-selected features. CTP-LLM achieves a 67% accuracy rate in predicting trial phase transitions across all phases and a 75% accuracy rate specifically in predicting the transition from Phase~III to final approval. Our experimental performance highlights the potential of LLM-powered applications in forecasting clinical trial outcomes and assessing trial design.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An obstetric goal for a laboring mother is to achieve a vaginal delivery as it reduces the risks inherent in major abdominal surgery (i.e., a Cesarean section). Various medical interventions may be used by a physician to increase the likelihood of this occurring while minimizing maternal and fetal morbidity. However, patients with prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) have only two commonly used options for cervical ripening, Pitocin and misoprostol. Little research exists on the benefits/risks for these two key drugs for PROM patients. A major limitation with most induction-of-labor related research is the inability to account for differences in \textit{Bishop scores} that are commonly used in obstetrical practice to determine the next induction agent offered to the patient. This creates a confounding factor, which biases the results, but has not been realized in the literature. In this work, we use a Bayesian model of the relationships between the relevant factors, informed by expert physicians, to separate the confounding variable from its actual impact. In doing so, we provide strong evidence that pitocin and buccal misoprostol are equally effective and safe; thus, physicians have more choice in clinical care than previously realized. This is particularly important for developing countries where neither medication may be readily available, and prior guidelines may create an artificial barrier to needed medication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objectives: Evaluating the effects and artifacts introduced by medical foreign bodies in clinical dark-field chest radiographs and assessing their influence on the evaluation of pulmonary tissue, compared to conventional radiographs.   Material & Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from subjects enrolled in clinical trials conducted between 2018 and 2021, focusing on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 patients. All patients obtained a radiograph using an in-house developed clinical prototype for grating-based dark-field chest radiography. The prototype simultaneously delivers a conventional and dark-field radiograph. Two radiologists independently assessed the clinical studies to identify patients with foreign bodies. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted on the effects and artifacts attributed to distinct foreign bodies and their impact on the assessment of pulmonary tissue.   Results: Overall, 30 subjects with foreign bodies were included in this study (mean age, 64 years +/- 11 [standard deviation]; 15 men). Foreign bodies composed of materials lacking microstructure exhibited a diminished dark-field signal or no discernible signal. Foreign bodies with a microstructure, in our investigations the cementation of the kyphoplasty, produce a positive dark-field signal. Since most foreign bodies lack microstructural features, dark-field imaging revealed fewer signals and artifacts by foreign bodies compared to conventional radiographs.   Conclusion: Dark-field radiography enhances the assessment of pulmonary tissue with overlaying foreign bodies compared to conventional radiography. Reduced interfering signals result in fewer overlapping radiopaque artifacts within the investigated regions. This mitigates the impact on image quality and interpretability of the radiographs and the projection-related limitations of radiography compared to CT.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Chronic wounds pose an ongoing health concern globally, largely due to the prevalence of conditions such as diabetes and leprosy's disease. The standard method of monitoring these wounds involves visual inspection by healthcare professionals, a practice that could present challenges for patients in remote areas with inadequate transportation and healthcare infrastructure. This has led to the development of algorithms designed for the analysis and follow-up of wound images, which perform image-processing tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms heavily depends on the availability of comprehensive and varied wound image data, which is usually scarce. This paper introduces the CO2Wounds-V2 dataset, an extended collection of RGB wound images from leprosy patients with their corresponding semantic segmentation annotations, aiming to enhance the development and testing of image-processing algorithms in the medical field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The challenge of Multimodal Deformable Image Registration (MDIR) lies in the conversion and alignment of features between images of different modalities. Generative models (GMs) cannot retain the necessary information enough from the source modality to the target one, while non-GMs struggle to align features across these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine MDIR framework,LLM-Morph, which is applicable to various pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve these concerns by aligning the deep features from different modal medical images. Specifically, we first utilize a CNN encoder to extract deep visual features from cross-modal image pairs, then we use the first adapter to adjust these tokens, and use LoRA in pre-trained LLMs to fine-tune their weights, both aimed at eliminating the domain gap between the pre-trained LLMs and the MDIR task. Third, for the alignment of tokens, we utilize other four adapters to transform the LLM-encoded tokens into multi-scale visual features, generating multi-scale deformation fields and facilitating the coarse-to-fine MDIR task. Extensive experiments in MR-CT Abdomen and SR-Reg Brain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the potential of pre-trained LLMs for MDIR task.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern deep learning continues to achieve outstanding performance on an astounding variety of high-dimensional tasks. In practice, this is obtained by fitting deep neural models to all the input data with minimal feature engineering, thus sacrificing interpretability in many cases. However, in applications such as medicine, where interpretability is crucial, feature subset selection becomes an important problem. Metaheuristics such as Binary Differential Evolution are a popular approach to feature selection, and the research literature continues to introduce novel ideas, drawn from quantum computing and chaos theory, for instance, to improve them. In this paper, we demonstrate that introducing chaos-generated variables, generated from considerations of the Lyapunov time, in place of random variables in quantum-inspired metaheuristics significantly improves their performance on high-dimensional medical classification tasks and outperforms other approaches. We show that this chaos-induced improvement is a general phenomenon by demonstrating it for multiple varieties of underlying quantum-inspired metaheuristics. Performance is further enhanced through Lasso-assisted feature pruning. At the implementation level, we vastly speed up our algorithms through a scalable island-based computing cluster parallelization technique.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cervical cancer is a crucial global health concern for women, and the persistent infection of High-risk HPV mainly triggers this remains a global health challenge, with young women diagnosis rates soaring from 10\% to 40\% over three decades. While Pap smear screening is a prevalent diagnostic method, visual image analysis can be lengthy and often leads to mistakes. Early detection of the disease can contribute significantly to improving patient outcomes. In recent decades, many researchers have employed machine learning techniques that achieved promise in cervical cancer detection processes based on medical images. In recent years, many researchers have employed various deep-learning techniques to achieve high-performance accuracy in detecting cervical cancer but are still facing various challenges. This research proposes an innovative and novel approach to automate cervical cancer image classification using Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method leverages the strengths of both MHSA mechanisms and CNN to effectively capture both local and global features within cervical images in two streams. MHSA facilitates the model's ability to focus on relevant regions of interest, while CNN extracts hierarchical features that contribute to accurate classification. Finally, we combined the two stream features and fed them into the classification module to refine the feature and the classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we used the SIPaKMeD dataset, which classifies cervical cells into five categories. Our model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.522\%. This performance has high recognition accuracy of medical image classification and holds promise for its applicability in other medical image recognition tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a microstructure imaging technique for estimating compartment-specific T2 and T2* simultaneously in the human brain. Microstructure imaging with diffusion MRI (dMRI) has enabled the modelling of intra-neurite and extra-neurite diffusion signals separately allowing for the estimation of compartment-specific tissue properties. These compartment-specific properties have been widely used in clinical studies. However, conventional dMRI cannot disentangle differences in relaxations between tissue compartments, causing biased estimates of diffusion measures which also change with TE. To solve the problem, combined relaxometry-diffusion imaging methods have been developed in recent years, providing compartmental T2-diffusion or T2*-diffusion imaging respectively, but not T2 and T2* together. As they provide complementary information, a technique that can estimate both jointly with diffusion is appealing to neuroimaging studies. The aim of this work is to develop a method to map compartmental T2-T2*-diffusion simultaneously. Using an advanced MRI acquisition called diffusion-PEPTIDE, a novel microstructure model is proposed and a multi-step fitting method is developed to estimate parameters of interest. We demonstrate for the first time that compartmental T2, T2* can be estimated simultaneously from in vivo data. we further show the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation with simulation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mesh reconstruction based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is popular in a variety of applications such as computer graphics, virtual reality, and medical imaging due to its efficiency in handling complex geometric structures and facilitating real-time rendering. However, existing works often fail to capture fine geometric details accurately and struggle with optimizing rendering quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that progressively generates and optimizes meshes from multi-view images. Our approach initiates with the training of a NeRF model to establish an initial Signed Distance Field (SDF) and a view-dependent appearance field. Subsequently, we iteratively refine the SDF through a differentiable mesh extraction method, continuously updating both the vertex positions and their connectivity based on the loss from mesh differentiable rasterization, while also optimizing the appearance representation. To further leverage high-fidelity and detail-rich representations from NeRF, we propose an online-learning strategy based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to enhance viewpoints by adaptively incorporating images rendered by the initial NeRF model into the training dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers highly competitive and robust performance in both mesh rendering quality and geometric quality.</td>
