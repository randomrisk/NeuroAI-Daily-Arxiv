<td style='padding: 4px;'>Few-shot image classification has become a popular research topic for its wide application in real-world scenarios, however the problem of supervision collapse induced by single image-level annotation remains a major challenge. Existing methods aim to tackle this problem by locating and aligning relevant local features. However, the high intra-class variability in real-world images poses significant challenges in locating semantically relevant local regions under few-shot settings. Drawing inspiration from the human's complementary learning system, which excels at rapidly capturing and integrating semantic features from limited examples, we propose the generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network, SCAM-Net. This approach simulates the systems consolidation of complementary learning system with an adaptive memory module, which successfully addresses the difficulty of identifying meaningful features in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we construct a Hippocampus-Neocortex dual-network that consolidates structured representation of each category, the structured representation is then stored and adaptively regulated following the generalization optimization principle in a long-term memory inside Neocortex. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain nuclei are clusters of anatomically distinct neurons that serve as important hubs for processing and relaying information in various neural circuits. Fine-scale parcellation of the brain nuclei is vital for a comprehensive understanding of its anatomico-functional correlations. Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that can estimate the brain's white matter structural connectivity to potentially reveal the topography of the nuclei of interest for studying its subdivisions. In this work, we present a deep clustering pipeline, namely DeepNuParc, to perform automated, fine-scale parcellation of brain nuclei using diffusion MRI tractography. First, we incorporate a newly proposed deep learning approach to enable accurate segmentation of the nuclei of interest directly on the dMRI data. Next, we design a novel streamline clustering-based structural connectivity feature for a robust representation of voxels within the nuclei. Finally, we improve the popular joint dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering approach to enable nuclei parcellation at a finer scale. We demonstrate DeepNuParc on two important brain structures, i.e. the amygdala and the thalamus, that are known to have multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei subdivisions. Experimental results show that DeepNuParc enables consistent parcellation of the nuclei into multiple parcels across multiple subjects and achieves good correspondence with the widely used coarse-scale atlases.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper presents a novel split parallel algorithm for solving quasi-static multiple-network poroelasticity (MPET) equations. By introducing a total pressure variable, the MPET system can be reformulated into a coupled Stokes-parabolic system. To efficiently solve this system, we propose a split parallel approach. In the first time step, a monolithic solver is used to solve all variables simultaneously. For subsequent time steps, the system is split into a Stokes subproblem and a parabolic subproblem. These subproblems are then solved in parallel using a stabilization technique. This split parallel approach differs from sequential or iterative decoupling, significantly reducing computational time. The algorithm is proven to be unconditionally stable, optimally convergent, and robust across various parameter settings. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. We also apply this parallel algorithm to simulate fluid-tissue interactions within the physiological environment of the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early brain development is crucial for lifelong neurodevelopmental health. However, current clinical practice offers limited knowledge of normal embryonic brain anatomy on ultrasound, despite the brain undergoing rapid changes within the time-span of days. To provide detailed insights into normal brain development and identify deviations, we created the 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas using a deep learning-based approach for groupwise registration and spatiotemporal atlas generation. Our method introduced a time-dependent initial atlas and penalized deviations from it, ensuring age-specific anatomy was maintained throughout rapid development. The atlas was generated and validated using 831 3D ultrasound images from 402 subjects in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, acquired between gestational weeks 8 and 12. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which demonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization produced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations led to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing ex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In conclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical development of the embryonic brain. The resulting 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas provides a unique insights into this crucial early life period and holds the potential for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of prenatal neurodevelopmental disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Whole-brain tractography in diffusion MRI is often followed by a parcellation in which each streamline is classified as belonging to a specific white matter bundle, or discarded as a false positive. Efficient parcellation is important both in large-scale studies, which have to process huge amounts of data, and in the clinic, where computational resources are often limited. TractCloud is a state-of-the-art approach that aims to maximize accuracy with a local-global representation. We demonstrate that the local context does not contribute to the accuracy of that approach, and is even detrimental when dealing with pathological cases. Based on this observation, we propose PETParc, a new method for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation. PETParc is a transformer-based architecture in which the whole-brain tractogram is randomly partitioned into sub-tractograms whose streamlines are classified in parallel, while serving as global context for each other. This leads to a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude relative to TractCloud, and permits inference even on clinical workstations without a GPU. PETParc accounts for the lack of streamline orientation either via a novel flip-invariant embedding, or by simply using flips as part of data augmentation. Despite the speedup, results are often even better than those of prior methods. The code and pretrained model will be made public upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional artificial neural networks take inspiration from biological networks, using layers of neuron-like nodes to pass information for processing. More realistic models include spiking in the neural network, capturing the electrical characteristics more closely. However, a large proportion of brain cells are of the glial cell type, in particular astrocytes which have been suggested to play a role in performing computations. Here, we introduce a modified spiking neural network model with added astrocyte-like units in a neural network and asses their impact on learning. We implement the network as a liquid state machine and task the network with performing a chaotic time-series prediction task. We varied the number and ratio of neuron-like and astrocyte-like units in the network to examine the latter units effect on learning. We show that the combination of neurons and astrocytes together, as opposed to neural- and astrocyte-only networks, are critical for driving learning. Interestingly, we found that the highest learning rate was achieved when the ratio between astrocyte-like and neuron-like units was roughly 2 to 1, mirroring some estimates of the ratio of biological astrocytes to neurons. Our results demonstrate that incorporating astrocyte-like units which represent information across longer timescales can alter the learning rates of neural networks, and the proportion of astrocytes to neurons should be tuned appropriately to a given task.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interactive segmentation models use real-time user interactions, such as mouse clicks, as extra inputs to dynamically refine the model predictions. After model deployment, user corrections of model predictions could be used to adapt the model to the post-deployment data distribution, countering distribution-shift and enhancing reliability. Motivated by this, we introduce an online adaptation framework that enables an interactive segmentation model to continuously learn from user interaction and improve its performance on new data distributions, as it processes a sequence of test images. We introduce the Gaussian Point Loss function to train the model how to leverage user clicks, along with a two-stage online optimization method that adapts the model using the corrected predictions generated via user interactions. We demonstrate that this simple and therefore practical approach is very effective. Experiments on 5 fundus and 4 brain MRI databases demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches under various data distribution shifts, including segmentation of image modalities and pathologies not seen during training.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>3D neuroimages provide a comprehensive view of brain structure and function, aiding in precise localization and functional connectivity analysis. Segmentation of white matter (WM) tracts using 3D neuroimages is vital for understanding the brain's structural connectivity in both healthy and diseased states. One-shot Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (OCIS) refers to effectively segmenting new (novel) classes using only a single sample while retaining knowledge of old (base) classes without forgetting. Voxel-contrastive OCIS methods adjust the feature space to alleviate the feature overlap problem between the base and novel classes. However, since WM tract segmentation is a multi-label segmentation task, existing single-label voxel contrastive-based methods may cause inherent contradictions. To address this, we propose a new multi-label voxel contrast framework called MultiCo3D for one-shot class incremental tract segmentation. Our method utilizes uncertainty distillation to preserve base tract segmentation knowledge while adjusting the feature space with multi-label voxel contrast to alleviate feature overlap when learning novel tracts and dynamically weighting multi losses to balance overall loss. We compare our method against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The experimental results show that our method significantly enhances one-shot class incremental tract segmentation accuracy across five different experimental setups on HCP and Preto datasets.</td>

It integrates three complementary metrics, each capturing a different aspect of semantic similarity between images. Using carefully crowd-sourced human judgment data, we demonstrate that SEED achieves the highest alignment with human evaluations, outperforming other widely used metrics. Through the evaluation of existing visual brain decoding models, we further reveal that crucial information is often lost in translation, even in state-of-the-art models that achieve near-perfect scores on existing metrics. To facilitate further research, we open-source the human judgment data, encouraging the development of more advanced evaluation methods for brain decoding models. Additionally, we propose a novel loss function designed to enhance semantic decoding performance by leveraging the order of pairwise cosine similarity in CLIP image embeddings. This loss function is compatible with various existing methods and has been shown to consistently improve their semantic decoding performances when used for training, with respect to both existing metrics and SEED.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is crucial in extensive practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, medical EEG analysis, and action recognition. Real-world time series datasets typically exhibit complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, RNN-based, CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid models have been proposed. Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks.</td>

However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how children communicate and relate to other people and the world around them. Emerging studies have shown that neurofeedback training (NFT) games are an effective and playful intervention to enhance social and attentional capabilities for autistic children. However, NFT is primarily available in a clinical setting that is hard to scale. Also, the intervention demands deliberately-designed gamified feedback with fun and enjoyment, where little knowledge has been acquired in the HCI community. Through a ten-month iterative design process with four domain experts, we developed Eggly, a mobile NFT game based on a consumer-grade EEG headband and a tablet. Eggly uses novel augmented reality (AR) techniques to offer engagement and personalization, enhancing their training experience. We conducted two field studies (a single-session study and a three-week multi-session study) with a total of five autistic children to assess Eggly in practice at a special education center. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate the effectiveness of the approach as well as contribute to the design knowledge of creating mobile AR NFT games.</td>

While existing normalization layers, Batch-Norm, LayerNorm and InstanceNorm, help address distribution shifts, they fail to capture the temporal dependencies inherent in temporal signals. In this paper, we propose PSDNorm, a layer that leverages Monge mapping and temporal context to normalize feature maps in deep learning models. Notably, the proposed method operates as a test-time domain adaptation technique, addressing distribution shifts without additional training. Evaluations on 10 sleep staging datasets using the U-Time model demonstrate that PSDNorm achieves state-of-the-art performance at test time on datasets not seen during training while being 4x more data-efficient than the best baseline. Additionally, PSDNorm provides a significant improvement in robustness, achieving markedly higher F1 scores for the 20% hardest subjects.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Coherence analysis plays a vital role in the study of functional brain connectivity. However, coherence captures only linear spectral associations, and thus can produce misleading findings when ignoring variations of connectivity in the tails of the distribution. This limitation becomes important when investigating extreme neural events that are characterized by large signal amplitudes. The focus of this paper is to examine connectivity in the tails of the distribution, as this reveals salient information that may be overlooked by standard methods. We develop a novel notion of spectral tail association of periodograms to study connectivity in the network of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of seizure-prone neonates. We further develop a novel non-stationary extremal dependence model for multivariate time series that captures differences in extremal dependence during different brain phases, namely burst-suppression and non-burst-suppression. One advantage of our proposed approach is its ability to identify tail connectivity at key frequency bands that could be associated with outbursts of energy which may lead to seizures. We discuss these novel scientific findings alongside a comparison of the extremal behavior of brain signals for epileptic and non-epileptic patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to focus auditory attention in complex acoustic environments, such as cocktail parties. Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) data. Existing AAD algorithms often leverage deep learning's powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities, few consider the neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing in the brain. In this paper, we propose SincAlignNet, a novel network based on an improved SincNet and contrastive learning, designed to align audio and EEG features for auditory attention detection. The SincNet component simulates the brain's processing of audio during auditory attention, while contrastive learning guides the model to learn the relationship between EEG signals and attended speech. During inference, we calculate the cosine similarity between EEG and audio features and also explore direct inference of the attended speaker using EEG data. Cross-trial evaluations results demonstrate that SincAlignNet outperforms state-of-the-art AAD methods on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU, achieving average accuracies of 78.3% and 92.2%, respectively, with a 1-second decision window. The model exhibits strong interpretability, revealing that the left and right temporal lobes are more active during both male and female speaker scenarios. Furthermore, we found that using data from only six electrodes near the temporal lobes maintains similar or even better performance compared to using 64 electrodes. These findings indicate that efficient low-density EEG online decoding is achievable, marking an important step toward the practical implementation of neuro-guided hearing aids in real-world applications.

Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be fine-tuned for age group classification, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotional Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is an important method for diagnosing health conditions such as autism or depression, as well as understanding emotions in individuals who struggle to express their feelings. Current ERC methods primarily rely on complete semantic textual information, including audio and visual data, but face challenges in integrating physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG). This paper proposes a novel Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning Framework (Hyper-MML), designed to effectively identify emotions in conversation by integrating EEG with audio and video information to capture complex emotional dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper-MML significantly outperforms traditional methods in emotion recognition. This is achieved through a Multi-modal Hypergraph Fusion Module (MHFM), which actively models higher-order relationships between multi-modal signals, as validated on the EAV dataset. Our proposed Hyper-MML serves as an effective communication tool for healthcare professionals, enabling better engagement with patients who have difficulty expressing their emotions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has motivated similar approaches for general time series analysis. While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The emergence of vision-language-action (VLA) models has given rise to foundation models for robot manipulation. Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the rapid advancement of deep learning, attention mechanisms have become indispensable in electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis, significantly enhancing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology. This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers seeking to leverage attention mechanisms for improved EEG interpretation and application.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative communication methods for individuals with motor disabilities by allowing control and interaction with external devices. Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning has achieved significant progress in the development of electroencephalogram (EEG) foundation models, with Transformer-based architectures excelling at capturing long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic computational complexity presents challenges in memory efficiency, training, and inference speed, limiting their scalability and generalizability as a foundation model. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework based on structured state space duality (SSD) that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 introduces three key innovations: (1) a reconstruction-based framework that captures both local and global EEG features through Mamba-2 structured state space models, (2) a spatiotemporal-aware loss function that enhances robustness to noise and preserves spectral information, and (3) a multi-branch receptive field input embedding strategy that improves cross-subject generalization and stability for EEG sequences of varying lengths. In comparison to traditional pretraining methods, on raw EEG or latent representation spaces, EEGM2 shows superior performance on long-sequence tasks, where conventional models struggle. Our experimental results on six EEG datasets validate that EEGM2 not only achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it a more efficient solution for deployment on resource-constrained BCI devices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) serves as a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device. While supervised learning has been extensively explored for motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, small data quantity has been a key factor limiting the performance of deep feature learning. Methods: This paper proposes a knowledge-driven time-space-frequency based multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet) for MI EEG decoding in BCIs. MVCNet integrates knowledge from the time, space, and frequency domains into the training process through data augmentations from multiple views, fostering more discriminative feature learning of the characteristics of EEG data. We introduce a cross-view contrasting module to learn from different augmented views and a cross-model contrasting module to enhance the consistency of features extracted between knowledge-guided and data-driven models. Results: The combination of EEG data augmentation strategies was systematically investigated for more informative supervised contrastive learning. Experiments on four public MI datasets and three different architectures demonstrated that MVCNet outperformed 10 existing approaches. Significance: Our approach can significantly boost EEG classification performance beyond designated networks, showcasing the potential to enhance the feature learning process for better EEG decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction. The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) is a popular paradigm for its simplicity and high information transfer rate (ITR). Accurate and fast SSVEP decoding is crucial for reliable BCI performance. However, conventional decoding methods demand longer time windows, and deep learning models typically require subject-specific fine-tuning, leaving challenges in achieving optimal performance in cross-subject settings. This paper proposed a biofocal masking attention-based method (SSVEP-BiMA) that synergistically leverages the native and symmetric-antisymmetric components for decoding SSVEP. By utilizing multiple signal representations, the network is able to integrate features from a wider range of sample perspectives, leading to more generalized and comprehensive feature learning, which enhances both prediction accuracy and robustness. We performed experiments on two public datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses baseline approaches in both accuracy and ITR. We believe that this work will contribute to the development of more efficient SSVEP-based BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In MRI-based mental disorder diagnosis, most previous studies focus on functional connectivity network (FCN) derived from functional MRI (fMRI). However, the small size of annotated fMRI datasets restricts its wide application. Meanwhile, structural MRIs (sMRIs), such as 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, which are commonly used and readily accessible in clinical settings, are often overlooked. To integrate the complementary information from both function and structure for improved diagnostic accuracy, we propose CINP (Contrastive Image-Network Pre-training), a framework that employs contrastive learning between sMRI and FCN. During pre-training, we incorporate masked image modeling and network-image matching to enhance visual representation learning and modality alignment. Since the CINP facilitates knowledge transfer from FCN to sMRI, we introduce network prompting. It utilizes only sMRI from suspected patients and a small amount of FCNs from different patient classes for diagnosing mental disorders, which is practical in real-world clinical scenario. The competitive performance on three mental disorder diagnosis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CINP in integrating multimodal MRI information, as well as the potential of incorporating sMRI into clinical diagnosis using network prompting.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise parcellation of functional networks (FNs) of early developing human brain is the fundamental basis for identifying biomarker of developmental disorders and understanding functional development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease.</td>

While syncopation has been extensively studied in groove perception, the neural mechanisms underlying low-frequency groove remain underexplored. This fMRI study examines the role of the mirror neuron system and associated brain regions in processing low-frequency groove. Region-of-interest analysis revealed that amplifying drum and bass components in K-pop songs significantly increased activity in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior/superior parietal lobules, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that low-frequency grooves engage sensorimotor, executive, and rhythm semantics networks, reinforcing their role in action-related processing.

Precisely localizing these regions stands as a crucial long-term goal in neuroscience to grasp essential brain functions and mechanisms. Conventional experiment-driven approaches hinge on manually constructed visual stimulus collections and corresponding brain activity recordings, constraining the support and coverage of concept localization. Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural contexts and are potentially biased by subjective preferences, thus prompting concerns about the validity and generalizability of the identified regions. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven exploration approach. By synthesizing extensive brain activity recordings, we statistically localize various concept-selective regions. Our proposed MindSimulator leverages advanced generative technologies to learn the probability distribution of brain activity conditioned on concept-oriented visual stimuli. This enables the creation of simulated brain recordings that reflect real neural response patterns. Using the synthetic recordings, we successfully localize several well-studied concept-selective regions and validate them against empirical findings, achieving promising prediction accuracy. The feasibility opens avenues for exploring novel concept-selective regions and provides prior hypotheses for future neuroscience research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate MR signal simulation, including microvascular structures and water diffusion, is crucial for MRI techniques like fMRI BOLD modeling and MR vascular Fingerprinting (MRF), which use susceptibility effects on MR signals for tissue characterization. However, integrating microvascular features and diffusion remains computationally challenging, limiting the accuracy of the estimates. Using advanced modeling and deep neural networks, we propose a novel simulation tool that efficiently accounts for susceptibility and diffusion effects. We used dimension reduction of magnetic field inhomogeneity matrices combined with deep learning method to accelerate the simulations while maintaining their accuracy. We validated our results through an in silico study against a reference method and in vivo MRF experiments. This approach accelerates MR signal generation by a factor of almost 13,000 compared to previously used simulation methods while preserving accuracy. The MR-WAVES method allows fast generation of MR signals accounting for microvascular structures and water-diffusion contribution.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In recent years,the application of deep learning in task functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (tfMRI) decoding has led to significant advancements. However,most studies remain constrained by assumption of temporal stationarity in neural activity,resulting in predominantly block-wise analysis with limited temporal resolution on the order of tens of seconds. This limitation restricts the ability to decode cognitive functions in detail. To address these limitations, this study proposes a deep neural network designed for volume-wise identification of task states within tfMRI data,thereby overcoming the constraints of conventional methods. Evaluated on Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor and gambling tfMRI datasets,the model achieved impressive mean accuracy rates of 94.0% and 79.6%,respectively. These results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in temporal resolution,enabling more detailed exploration of cognitive processes. The study further employs visualization algorithms to investigate dynamic brain mappings during different tasks,marking a significant step forward in deep learning-based frame-level tfMRI decoding. This approach offers new methodologies and tools for examining dynamic changes in brain activities and understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuropathic pain, affecting up to 10% of adults, remains difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Developing interpretable models for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is highly valuable yet challenging, primarily due to the complexity of encoding, decoding and integrating imaging and non-imaging data. Many existing machine learning models struggle to provide comprehensive interpretability, often failing to extract meaningful biomarkers from imaging data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or lacking mechanisms to explain the significance of non-imaging data. In this paper, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a novel framework designed to learn from fine-grained local patterns to comprehensive global multi-modal interactions. This framework comprises two key modules. The first module, the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer) for local patterns, integrates global modeling with brain connectomic-constrained graph neural networks to identify biomarkers through information bottleneck-guided pooling. The second module, the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN) for global multi-modal interactions, facilitates interpretable multi-modal fusion of imaging and non-imaging data using heterogeneous graph neural networks. The results of the experiments demonstrate that I2B-HGNN excels in diagnosing NDDs with high accuracy, providing interpretable biomarker identification and effective analysis of non-imaging data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S\subseteq V$ is said to be a monitoring edge-geodetic set if the deletion of any edge in the graph results in a change in the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $S$. The minimum size of such a set in $G$ is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$ and is denoted by $meg(G)$.   In this work, we compute the monitoring edge-geodetic number efficiently for the following graph classes: distance-hereditary graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, and strongly chordal graphs. The algorithms follow from structural characterizations of the optimal monitoring edge-geodetic sets for these graph classes in terms of \emph{mandatory vertices} (those that need to be in every solution). This extends previous results from the literature for cographs, interval graphs and block graphs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Standard language model evaluations can fail to capture risks that emerge only at deployment scale. For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.</td>

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner has been shown to be more accurate than other medical devices in detecting mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity.</td>

To defend against these attacks, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers: safeguards trained on synthetic data, generated by prompting LLMs with natural language rules (i.e., a constitution) specifying permitted and restricted content. In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks. These classifiers also maintain deployment viability, with an absolute 0.38% increase in production-traffic refusals and a 23.7% inference overhead. Our work demonstrates that defending against universal jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment viability is tractable.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Journalism has emerged as an essential domain for understanding the uses, limitations, and impacts of large language models (LLMs) in the workplace. News organizations face divergent financial incentives: LLMs already permeate newswork processes within financially constrained organizations, even as ongoing legal challenges assert that AI companies violate their copyright. At stake are key questions about what LLMs are created to do, and by whom: How might a journalist-led LLM work, and what can participatory design illuminate about the present-day challenges about adapting ``one-size-fits-all'' foundation models to a given context of use? In this paper, we undertake a co-design exploration to understand how a participatory approach to LLMs might address opportunities and challenges around AI in journalism. Our 20 interviews with reporters, data journalists, editors, labor organizers, product leads, and executives highlight macro, meso, and micro tensions that designing for this opportunity space must address. From these desiderata, we describe the result of our co-design work: organizational structures and functionality for a journalist-controlled LLM. In closing, we discuss the limitations of commercial foundation models for workplace use, and the methodological implications of applying participatory methods to LLM co-design.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) structures from two-dimensional (2D) X-ray images is a valuable and efficient technique in medical applications that requires less radiation exposure than computed tomography scans. Recent approaches that use implicit neural representations have enabled the synthesis of novel views from sparse X-ray images. However, although image synthesis has improved the accuracy, the accuracy of surface shape estimation remains insufficient. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing 3D scenes using a Neural Attenuation Surface (NeAS) that simultaneously captures the surface geometry and attenuation coefficient fields. NeAS incorporates a signed distance function (SDF), which defines the attenuation field and aids in extracting the 3D surface within the scene. We conducted experiments using simulated and authentic X-ray images, and the results demonstrated that NeAS could accurately extract 3D surfaces within a scene using only 2D X-ray images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) finds broad applications in healthcare, aiding clinicians and radiologists by automatically retrieving relevant patient cases in the database given the query image and/or report, for more efficient clinical diagnosis and treatment, especially for rare diseases. However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised representation learning methods often fail to learn subtle or complex features, which can be dominated by simpler patterns which are much easier to learn. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale natural images have been widely used to adapt to medical image analysis through finetuning. This is largely attributed to pretrained representations capturing universal, robust, and generalizable features, which can be reutilized by downstream tasks. However, these representations are later found to gradually vanish during finetuning, accompanied by a degradation of foundation model's original abilities, e.g., generalizability. In this paper, we argue that pretrained representations can be well preserved while still effectively adapting to downstream tasks. We study this by proposing a new finetuning method RepSim, which minimizes the distance between pretrained and finetuned representations via constraining learnable orthogonal manifold based on similarity invariance. Compared to standard finetuning methods, e.g., full finetuning, our method improves representation similarity by over 30% while maintaining competitive accuracy, and reduces sharpness by 42% across five medical image classification datasets. The code will be released.</td>

We propose a novel framework for training iterative skeletonization algorithms with a learnable component. The framework leverages synthetic data, task-specific augmentation, and a model distillation strategy to learn compact neural networks that produce thin, connected skeletons with a fully differentiable iterative algorithm.   Our method demonstrates a 100 times speedup over topology-constrained algorithms while maintaining high accuracy and generalizing effectively to new domains without fine-tuning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural changes. Unlike prior work that requires complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training from text-generation-only LLMs or random initialization, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet), and 7.5% (ImageNet) for advanced autoregressive LLMs like Chameleon and LlamaGen, all without framework modifications. For domain adaption, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). By demonstrating that training objective redesign -- not just architectural innovation -- can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges, ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. Code and models will be released to advance autoregressive image generation.</td>

Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quantitative MR (qMR) can provide numerical values representing the physical and chemical properties of the tissues. To collect a series of frames under varying settings, retrospective motion correction is essential to align the corresponding anatomical points or features. Under the assumption that the misalignment makes the discrepancy between the corresponding features larger, fitting error is a commonly used evaluation metric for motion correction in qMR. This study evaluates the reliability of the fitting error metric in cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) after deformable registration. We found that while fitting error correlates with the negative eigenvalues, the negative Jacobian Determinant increases with broken cardiomyocytes, indicated by helix angle gradient line profiles. Since fitting error measures the distance between moved points and their re-rendered counterparts, the fitting parameter itself may be adjusted due to poor registration. Therefore, fitting error in deformable registration itself is a necessary but not sufficient metric and should be combined with other metrics.</td>
