<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural signals related to movement can be measured from intracranial recordings and used in brain-machine interface devices (BMI) to restore physical function in impaired patients. In this study, we explore the use of more abstract neural signals related to economic value in a BMI context. Using data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders that can predict the monkey's choice in a value-based decision-making task. Out-of-sample performance was improved by augmenting the training set with synthesized data, showing the feasibility of using limited training data. We further demonstrate that we can predict the monkey's choice sooner using a neural forecasting module that is equipped with task-related information. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuroengineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The association between language and (non-linguistic) thinking ability in humans has long been debated, and recently, neuroscientific evidence of brain activity patterns has been considered. Such a scientific context naturally raises an interdisciplinary question -- what about such a language-thought dissociation in large language models (LLMs)? In this paper, as an initial foray, we explore this question by focusing on simple arithmetic skills (e.g., $1+2=$ ?) as a thinking ability and analyzing the geometry of their encoding in LLMs' representation space. Our experiments with linear classifiers and cluster separability tests demonstrate that simple arithmetic equations and general language input are encoded in completely separated regions in LLMs' internal representation space across all the layers, which is also supported with more controlled stimuli (e.g., spelled-out equations). These tentatively suggest that arithmetic reasoning is mapped into a distinct region from general language input, which is in line with the neuroscientific observations of human brain activations, while we also point out their somewhat cognitively implausible geometric properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Analysis of signals defined on complex topologies modeled by graphs is a topic of increasing interest. Signal decomposition plays a crucial role in the representation and processing of such information, in particular, to process graph signals based on notions of scale (e.g., coarse to fine). The graph spectrum is more irregular than for conventional domains; i.e., it is influenced by graph topology, and, therefore, assumptions about spectral representations of graph signals are not easy to make. Here, we propose a tight frame design that is adapted to the graph Laplacian spectral content of given classes of graph signals. The design is based on using the ensemble energy spectral density, a notion of spectral content of given signal sets that we determine either directly using the graph Fourier transform or indirectly through a polynomial-based approximation scheme. The approximation scheme has the benefit that (i) it does not require eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix making the method feasible for large graphs, and (ii) it leads to a smooth estimate of the spectral content. A prototype system of spectral kernels each capturing an equal amount of energy is initially defined and subsequently warped using the signal set's ensemble energy spectral density such that the resulting subbands each capture an equal amount of ensemble energy. This approach accounts at the same time for graph topology and signal features, and it provides a meaningful interpretation of subbands in terms of coarse-to-fine representations. We also show how more simplified designs of signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals can be adopted based on ensemble energy estimates. We show the application of proposed methods on the Minnesota road graph and three different designs of brain graphs derived from neuroimaging data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction. The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Target identification for tractography studies requires solid anatomical knowledge validated by an extensive literature review across species for each seed structure to be studied. Manual literature review to identify targets for a given seed region is tedious and potentially subjective. Therefore, complementary approaches would be useful. We propose to use text-mining models to automatically suggest potential targets from the neuroscientific literature, full-text articles and abstracts, so that they can be used for anatomical connection studies and more specifically for tractography. We applied text-mining models to three structures: two well-studied structures, since validated deep brain stimulation targets, the internal globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus and, the nucleus accumbens, an exploratory target for treating psychiatric disorders. We performed a systematic review of the literature to document the projections of the three selected structures and compared it with the targets proposed by text-mining models, both in rat and primate (including human). We ran probabilistic tractography on the nucleus accumbens and compared the output with the results of the text-mining models and literature review. Overall, text-mining the literature could find three times as many targets as two man-weeks of curation could. The overall efficiency of the text-mining against literature review in our study was 98% recall (at 36% precision), meaning that over all the targets for the three selected seeds, only one target has been missed by text-mining. We demonstrate that connectivity for a structure of interest can be extracted from a very large amount of publications and abstracts. We believe this tool will be useful in helping the neuroscience community to facilitate connectivity studies of particular brain regions. The text mining tools used for the study are part of the HBP Neuroinformatics Platform, publicly available at http://connectivity-brainer.rhcloud.com</td>

The objectives of this paper are (i) to develop and integrate a pipeline that goes from morphological feature extraction to classification and (ii) to assess and compare the accuracy of machine learning algorithms to classify neuron morphologies. The algorithms were trained on 430 digitally reconstructed neurons subjectively classified into layers and/or m-types using young and/or adult development state population of the somatosensory cortex in rats. For supervised algorithms, linear discriminant analysis provided better classification results in comparison with others. For unsupervised algorithms, the affinity propagation and the Ward algorithms provided slightly better results.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human-multi-robot shared control leverages human decision-making and robotic autonomy to enhance human-robot collaboration. While widely studied, existing systems often adopt a leader-follower model, limiting robot autonomy to some extent. Besides, a human is required to directly participate in the motion control of robots through teleoperation, which significantly burdens the operator. To alleviate these two issues, we propose a layered shared control computing framework using human-influenced guiding vector fields (HI-GVF) for human-robot collaboration. HI-GVF guides the multi-robot system along a desired path specified by the human. Then, an intention field is designed to merge the human and robot intentions, accelerating the propagation of the human intention within the multi-robot system. Moreover, we give the stability analysis of the proposed model and use collision avoidance based on safety barrier certificates to fine-tune the velocity. Eventually, considering the firefighting task as an example scenario, we conduct simulations and experiments using multiple human-robot interfaces (brain-computer interface, myoelectric wristband, eye-tracking), and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach boosts the effectiveness and performance of the task.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>PET is affected by statistical noise due to constraints on tracer dose and scan duration, impacting both diagnostic performance and quantitative accuracy. While deep learning (DL)-based PET denoising methods have been used to improve image quality, they may introduce over-smoothing, compromising quantitative accuracy. We propose a method for making a DL solution more reliable and apply it to the conditional deep image prior (DIP). We introduce the idea of stability information in the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling the identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization trajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from multiple intermediate outputs of moderate network at different optimization steps. The final denoised image is then obtained by computing linear combination of the DIP output and the original reconstructed image, weighted by the stability map. Our method effectively reduces noise while preserving small structure details in brain FDG images. Results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing methods in peak-to-valley ratio and noise suppression across various low-dose levels. Region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the proposed method maintains quantitative accuracy without introducing under- or over-estimation. We applied our method to full-dose PET data to assess its impact on image quality. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced background noise while preserving the peak-to-valley ratio at a level comparable to that of unfiltered full-dose PET images. The proposed method introduces a robust approach to DL-based PET denoising, enhancing its reliability and preserving quantitative accuracy. This strategy has the potential to advance performance in high-sensitivity PET scanners, demonstrating that DL can extend PET imaging capabilities beyond low-dose applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cardiac arrest is very common nowadays. Sudden heart attack is a condition where the heart suddenly stops beating causing a significant decrease in blood flow to the brain. The first step in medical point of view is for a patient experiencing sudden heart attack is Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).Moreover, compression rate needed for CPR process is far beyond for humans to provide manually. So, there is intense need of mechanical device which can perform resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation device is used to augment the blood flow and maintain hemodynamic cycle of human body. CPR device is proposed to meet the effective and unique blood flow mechanism, feedback system. In term of effective and unique blood flow mechanism design and fabrication of low cost cardiopulmonary resuscitation device based on principle of CPR and two concepts. It is combined Sterno-Thoracic Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. The "cardiac pump" generates blood flow by squeezing blood out of the heart as the sternum is depressed. The "thoracic pump" increases intrathoracic pressure due to elastic recoil of ribs. In order to meet the American Heart Association standard guidelines a feedback system has established through closed loop control system, and integration of processing controllers. Specifically, a small HMI (Human machine interface) device has been established to control the whole mechanism which would be used for child, Adults and Senior citizens as a manual intelligence system. Henceforth, feedback system act as backbone for this device.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human-robot collaboration (HRC) relies on accurate and timely recognition of human intentions to ensure seamless interactions. Among common HRC tasks, human-to-robot object handovers have been studied extensively for planning the robot's actions during object reception, assuming the human intention for object handover. However, distinguishing handover intentions from other actions has received limited attention. Most research on handovers has focused on visually detecting motion trajectories, which often results in delays or false detections when trajectories overlap. This paper investigates whether human intentions for object handovers are reflected in non-movement-based physiological signals. We conduct a multimodal analysis comparing three data modalities: electroencephalogram (EEG), gaze, and hand-motion signals. Our study aims to distinguish between handover-intended human motions and non-handover motions in an HRC setting, evaluating each modality's performance in predicting and classifying these actions before and after human movement initiation. We develop and evaluate human intention detectors based on these modalities, comparing their accuracy and timing in identifying handover intentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically develop and test intention detectors across multiple modalities within the same experimental context of human-robot handovers. Our analysis reveals that handover intention can be detected from all three modalities. Nevertheless, gaze signals are the earliest as well as the most accurate to classify the motion as intended for handover or non-handover.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a hybrid brain-machine interface (BMI) that integrates steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based EEG and facial EMG to improve multimodal control and mitigate fatigue in assistive applications. Traditional BMIs relying solely on EEG or EMG suffer from inherent limitations; EEG-based control requires sustained visual focus, leading to cognitive fatigue, while EMG-based control induces muscular fatigue over time. Our system dynamically alternates between EEG and EMG inputs, using EEG to detect SSVEP signals at 9.75 Hz and 14.25 Hz and EMG from cheek and neck muscles to optimize control based on task demands. In a virtual turtle navigation task, the hybrid system achieved task completion times comparable to an EMG-only approach, while 90% of users reported reduced or equal physical demand. These findings demonstrate that multimodal BMI systems can enhance usability, reduce strain, and improve long-term adherence in assistive technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Due to the non-stationarity and large individual differences of EEG signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/session, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 10 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits the EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) activity contains a wealth of information about what is happening within the human brain. Recording more of this data has the potential to unlock endless future applications. However, the cost of EEG hardware is increasingly expensive based upon the number of EEG channels being recorded simultaneously. We combat this problem in this paper by proposing a novel deep EEG super-resolution (SR) approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This approach can produce high spatial resolution EEG data from low resolution samples, by generating channel-wise upsampled data to effectively interpolate numerous missing channels, thus reducing the need for expensive EEG equipment. We tested the performance using an EEG dataset from a mental imagery task. Our proposed GAN model provided 10^4 fold and 10^2 fold reduction in mean-squared error (MSE) and mean-absolute error (MAE), respectively, over the baseline bicubic interpolation method. We further validate our method by training a classifier on the original classification task, which displayed minimal loss in accuracy while using the super-resolved data. The proposed SR EEG by GAN is a promising approach to improve the spatial resolution of low density EEG headsets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG signals convey important information about brain activity both in healthy and pathological conditions. However, they are inherently noisy, which poses significant challenges for accurate analysis and interpretation. Traditional EEG artifact removal methods, while effective, often require extensive expert intervention. This study presents LSTEEG, a novel LSTM-based autoencoder designed for the detection and correction of artifacts in EEG signals. Leveraging deep learning, particularly LSTM layers, LSTEEG captures non-linear dependencies in sequential EEG data. LSTEEG demonstrates superior performance in both artifact detection and correction tasks compared to other state-of-the-art convolutional autoencoders. Our methodology enhances the interpretability and utility of the autoencoder's latent space, enabling data-driven automated artefact removal in EEG its application in downstream tasks. This research advances the field of efficient and accurate multi-channel EEG preprocessing, and promotes the implementation and usage of automated EEG analysis pipelines for brain health applications.</td>

In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) provides millisecond-level precision in capturing electrical activity but lacks the spatial resolution necessary for precise neural localization. To bridge these gaps, we introduce E2fNet, a simple yet effective deep learning model for synthesizing fMRI images from low-cost EEG data. E2fNet is specifically designed to capture and translate meaningful features from EEG across electrode channels into accurate fMRI representations. Extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that E2fNet consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Our findings suggest that E2fNet is a promising, cost-effective solution for enhancing neuroimaging capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kgr20/E2fNet.</td>

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In recent studies of emotional EEG classification, connectivity matrices have been successfully employed as input to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can effectively consider inter-regional interaction patterns in EEG. However, we find that such an approach has a limitation that important patterns in connectivity matrices may be lost during the convolutional operations in CNNs. To resolve this issue, we propose and validate an idea to upscale the connectivity matrices to strengthen the local patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that this simple idea can significantly enhance the classification performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by globally explaining spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, we introduce a method to retrieve the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compare it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We evaluate our approach on the MSA-CNN model using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. Our findings show that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-based spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Integration of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has opened new frontiers in brain signal decoding, enabling assistive communication, neural representation learning, and multimodal integration. BCIs, particularly those leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG), provide a non-invasive means of translating neural activity into meaningful outputs. Recent advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly improved EEG-based generation of images, text, and speech. This paper provides a literature review of the state-of-the-art in EEG-based multimodal generation, focusing on (i) EEG-to-image generation through GANs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models, and (ii) EEG-to-text generation leveraging Transformer based language models and contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we discuss the emerging domain of EEG-to-speech synthesis, an evolving multimodal frontier. We highlight key datasets, use cases, challenges, and EEG feature encoding methods that underpin generative approaches. By providing a structured overview of EEG-based generative AI, this survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with insights to advance neural decoding, enhance assistive technologies, and expand the frontiers of brain-computer interaction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction. The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) is a popular paradigm for its simplicity and high information transfer rate (ITR). Accurate and fast SSVEP decoding is crucial for reliable BCI performance. However, conventional decoding methods demand longer time windows, and deep learning models typically require subject-specific fine-tuning, leaving challenges in achieving optimal performance in cross-subject settings. This paper proposed a biofocal masking attention-based method (SSVEP-BiMA) that synergistically leverages the native and symmetric-antisymmetric components for decoding SSVEP. By utilizing multiple signal representations, the network is able to integrate features from a wider range of sample perspectives, leading to more generalized and comprehensive feature learning, which enhances both prediction accuracy and robustness. We performed experiments on two public datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses baseline approaches in both accuracy and ITR. We believe that this work will contribute to the development of more efficient SSVEP-based BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Due to the non-stationarity and large individual differences of EEG signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/session, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 10 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits the EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), the task of identifying objects concealed within their environments, has seen rapid growth due to its wide range of practical applications. A key step toward developing trustworthy COD systems is the estimation and effective utilization of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a human-machine collaboration framework for classifying the presence of camouflaged objects, leveraging the complementary strengths of computer vision (CV) models and noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our approach introduces a multiview backbone to estimate uncertainty in CV model predictions, utilizes this uncertainty during training to improve efficiency, and defers low-confidence cases to human evaluation via RSVP-based BCIs during testing for more reliable decision-making. We evaluated the framework in the CAMO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 4.56\% in balanced accuracy (BA) and 3.66\% in the F1 score compared to existing methods. For the best-performing participants, the improvements reached 7.6\% in BA and 6.66\% in the F1 score. Analysis of the training process revealed a strong correlation between our confidence measures and precision, while an ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed training policy and the human-machine collaboration strategy. In general, this work reduces human cognitive load, improves system reliability, and provides a strong foundation for advancements in real-world COD applications and human-computer interaction.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer transformative potential, but decoding neural signals presents significant challenges. The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study investigates continual fine-tuning strategies for deep learning in online longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) decoding within a causal setting involving a large user group and multiple sessions per participant. We are the first to explore such strategies across a large user group, as longitudinal adaptation is typically studied in the single-subject setting with a single adaptation strategy, which limits the ability to generalize findings. First, we examine the impact of different fine-tuning approaches on decoder performance and stability. Building on this, we integrate online test-time adaptation (OTTA) to adapt the model during deployment, complementing the effects of prior fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning that successively builds on prior subject-specific information improves both performance and stability, while OTTA effectively adapts the model to evolving data distributions across consecutive sessions, enabling calibration-free operation. These results offer valuable insights and recommendations for future research in longitudinal online MI decoding and highlight the importance of combining domain adaptation strategies for improving BCI performance in real-world applications. Clinical Relevance: Our investigation enables more stable and efficient long-term motor imagery decoding, which is critical for neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present the Mixture-of-Tunable-Experts (MoTE), a method that extends the Mixture-of-Experts architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs). Without additional training, MoTE enables meaningful and focused behavior changes in LLMs on-the-fly during inference time.   By analyzing the digital LLM brain of DeepSeek-R1 using a technique we dub 'functional Token Resonance Imaging' (fTRI) - inspired by fMRI and using prompts designed to elicit specific behavior (e.g., 'What happened {time}{place}?') - we empirically identify distinctive experts associated with behaviors like refusal responses.   Using MoTE we are able to intervene and control such specific behavior. We switched off the top 10 most refusal-relevant experts (0.07% of R1's 14,848 routed experts), achieving a 52% refusal reduction on sensitive reference prompts without performance degradation on MT-Bench. Random expert deactivation resulted in smaller behavioral shifts with increased noise, whereas forced expert activation led to significantly higher refusal rates.   Our approach shares similarities with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in terms of explainability and steerability. Unlike SAEs, MoTE does not require large training efforts, as within MoEs with a vast number of experts, specialization already emerged naturally during pretraining.   Our findings suggest that significant functional mechanisms in Mixture-of-Experts architectures can at least partially be localized in a small number of specific experts, rather than being distributed throughout the model's weights. Expert subgroups can be tuned to trigger significant behavior variations, providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional MRI measuring BOLD signal is an increasingly important imaging modality in studying brain functions and neurological disorders. It can be acquired in either a resting-state or a task-based paradigm. Compared to resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI is acquired while the subject is performing a specific task designed to enhance study-related brain activities. Consequently, it generally has more informative task-dependent signals. However, due to the variety of task designs, it is much more difficult than in resting state to aggregate task-based fMRI acquired in different tasks to train a generalizable model. To resolve this complication, we propose a supervised task-aware network TA-GAT that jointly learns a general-purpose encoder and task-specific contextual information. The encoder-generated embedding and the learned contextual information are then combined as input to multiple modules for performing downstream tasks. We believe that the proposed task-aware architecture can plug-and-play in any neural network architecture to incorporate the prior knowledge of fMRI tasks into capturing functional brain patterns.</td>

This approach is based on human-derived neuronal data in combination with a shared ontology to enable robots to learn from human experiences. To gain further insight into the relation between human neuronal activity patterns and ontological classes, we introduced General Linear Model (GLM) analyses on fMRI data of participants who were presented with complex naturalistic video stimuli comparable to the robot tasks. We modeled four event classes (pick, place, fetch and deliver) attached to different environmental and object-related context and employed a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) on associated brain activity patterns as a starting point for an automatic hierarchical clustering. Based on the default values for the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), the activity patterns were reliably grouped according to their parent classes of object interaction and navigation. Although fetch and deliver events were also distinguished by neuronal patterns, pick and place events demonstrated higher ambiguity with respect to neuronal activation patterns. Introducing a shorter HRF time-to-peak leads to a more reliable grouping of all four semantic classes, despite contextual factors. These data might give novel insights into the neuronal representation of complex stimuli and may enable further research in ontology validation in cognition-enabled robotics.</td>

E2fNet is specifically designed to capture and translate meaningful features from EEG across electrode channels into accurate fMRI representations. Extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that E2fNet consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM).

The model achieved an 8% improvement in HRV accuracy, as evidenced by enhanced performance metrics. This approach eliminates the need for peripheral photoplethysmography devices, reduces costs, and simplifies procedures in pediatric fMRI.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the medical field, most resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data are collected from multiple hospital sites. Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain diseases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnostic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding aims to reconstruct visual perception of human subject from fMRI signals, which is crucial for understanding brain's perception mechanisms. Existing methods are confined to the single-subject paradigm due to substantial brain variability, which leads to weak generalization across individuals and incurs high training costs, exacerbated by limited availability of fMRI data. To address these challenges, we propose MindAligner, an explicit functional alignment framework for cross-subject brain decoding from limited fMRI data. The proposed MindAligner enjoys several merits. First, we learn a Brain Transfer Matrix (BTM) that projects the brain signals of an arbitrary new subject to one of the known subjects, enabling seamless use of pre-trained decoding models. Second, to facilitate reliable BTM learning, a Brain Functional Alignment module is proposed to perform soft cross-subject brain alignment under different visual stimuli with a multi-level brain alignment loss, uncovering fine-grained functional correspondences with high interpretability. Experiments indicate that MindAligner not only outperforms existing methods in visual decoding under data-limited conditions, but also provides valuable neuroscience insights in cross-subject functional analysis. The code will be made publicly available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce a foundational model for brain dynamics that utilizes stochastic optimal control (SOC) and amortized inference. Our method features a continuous-discrete state space model (SSM) that can robustly handle the intricate and noisy nature of fMRI signals. To address computational limitations, we implement an approximation strategy grounded in the SOC framework. Additionally, we present a simulation-free latent dynamics approach that employs locally linear approximations, facilitating efficient and scalable inference. For effective representation learning, we derive an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) from the SOC formulation, which integrates smoothly with recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), thereby promoting robust and transferable representations. Pre-trained on extensive datasets such as the UKB, our model attains state-of-the-art results across a variety of downstream tasks, including demographic prediction, trait analysis, disease diagnosis, and prognosis. Moreover, evaluating on external datasets such as HCP-A, ABIDE, and ADHD200 further validates its superior abilities and resilience across different demographic and clinical distributions. Our foundational model provides a scalable and efficient approach for deciphering brain dynamics, opening up numerous applications in neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural oscillations facilitate the functioning of the human brain in spatial and temporal dimensions at various frequencies. These oscillations feature a universal frequency architecture that is governed by brain anatomy, ensuring frequency specificity remains invariant across different measurement techniques. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology constrained functional MRI (fMRI) investigations to a singular frequency range, thereby neglecting the frequency characteristics inherent in blood oxygen level-dependent oscillations. With advancements in MRI technology, it has become feasible to decode intricate brain activities via multi-band frequency analysis (MBFA). During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI studies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain. There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO MBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and enlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate the hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function, aimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Highway Performance Monitoring System, managed by the Federal Highway Administration, provides essential data on average annual daily traffic across U.S. roadways, but it has limited representation of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles on non-interstate roads. This gap limits research and policy analysis on the impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of truck traffic on vulnerable communities exposed to air pollution.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of human and artificial intelligence represents a scientific opportunity to advance our understanding of information processing, as each system offers unique computational insights that can enhance and inform the other. The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner has been shown to be more accurate than other medical devices in detecting mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to universal jailbreaks-prompting strategies that systematically bypass model safeguards and enable users to carry out harmful processes that require many model interactions, like manufacturing illegal substances at scale. To defend against these attacks, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers: safeguards trained on synthetic data, generated by prompting LLMs with natural language rules (i.e., a constitution) specifying permitted and restricted content. In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks. These classifiers also maintain deployment viability, with an absolute 0.38% increase in production-traffic refusals and a 23.7% inference overhead. Our work demonstrates that defending against universal jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment viability is tractable.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Journalism has emerged as an essential domain for understanding the uses, limitations, and impacts of large language models (LLMs) in the workplace. News organizations face divergent financial incentives: LLMs already permeate newswork processes within financially constrained organizations, even as ongoing legal challenges assert that AI companies violate their copyright. At stake are key questions about what LLMs are created to do, and by whom: How might a journalist-led LLM work, and what can participatory design illuminate about the present-day challenges about adapting ``one-size-fits-all'' foundation models to a given context of use? In this paper, we undertake a co-design exploration to understand how a participatory approach to LLMs might address opportunities and challenges around AI in journalism. Our 20 interviews with reporters, data journalists, editors, labor organizers, product leads, and executives highlight macro, meso, and micro tensions that designing for this opportunity space must address. From these desiderata, we describe the result of our co-design work: organizational structures and functionality for a journalist-controlled LLM. In closing, we discuss the limitations of commercial foundation models for workplace use, and the methodological implications of applying participatory methods to LLM co-design.</td>

The current generation of experiments probe CLFV in the muon sector in three complementary channels: $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^- N$ (Mu2e, COMET), $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma$ (MEG-II), and $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^+e^-$s (Mu3e). These experiments aim to enhance existing limits by several orders-of-magnitude in the coming decade and offer discovery potential to many new physics models. The proposed Advanced Muon Facility (AMF) would be a multi-purpose muon facility based at Fermilab and introduces an innovative approach based on a muon storage ring to enable a full suite of muon CLFV experiments.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generative AI has recently propelled the decoding of images from brain activity. How do these approaches scale with the amount and type of neural recordings? Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lepton flavor violation (LFV) offers a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in models addressing neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate LFV processes within the framework of type II seesaw leptogenesis, where the Standard Model is extended by an $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs field. We focus on key LFV processes including $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$, $\mu^+ \to e^+e^-e^+$, and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion in nuclei, deriving stringent constraints on the parameter space from current experimental data. We scan the 3$\sigma$ range of neutrino oscillation parameters and identify the most conservative bounds consistent with existing measurements. Our results reveal that the MEG experiment currently provides the strongest constraints in the normal ordering (NO) scenario, while the SINDRUM experiment offers comparable sensitivity in the inverted ordering (IO) case. Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e, and COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing larger regions of the parameter space. This work underscores the crucial role of LFV experiments in probing type II seesaw leptogenesis, providing an avenue to explore the connections between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and inflation at experimentally accessible energy scales.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study evaluates the uncertainty in nanodosimetric calculations caused by variations in interaction cross sections within Monte Carlo Track Structure (MCTS) simulation codes. Nanodosimetry relies on accurately simulating particle interactions at the molecular scale. Different MCTS codes employ distinct physical models and datasets for electron interactions in liquid water, a surrogate for biological tissues. The paper focuses on the Ionization Cluster Size Distribution (ICSD) generated by electrons of varying energies in nanometric volumes. Seven MCTS codes were tested using their native cross sections and a common dataset derived from averaging data used in the participating codes. The results reveal significant discrepancies among the codes in ICSDs and derived biologically relevant nanodosimetric quantities such as mean ionization numbers (M1) and probabilities of obtaining two or more ionizations (F2). The largest variations were observed for low-energy electrons, where the contribution from interaction cross sections dominates the overall uncertainties. For instance, M1 values for ICSDs of electron of 20 eV can differ by around 45 % (RSD) and 34 % (RSD) was found for F2 values of ICSDs of electrons of 50 eV. Using common cross sections substantially reduced the discrepancies, suggesting that cross section datasets are the primary source of variability. Finally, estimates of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage using the PARTRAC code highlight tht cross section variations have a non-negligible impact simulated biological outcomes, particularly for double-strand breaks (DSBs) Indeed, despite the fact that many other parameters in the simulation that can greatly differ from one code to another, the different interaction cross-sections studied in this work can lead to differences in the number of DSBs calculated with the PARTRAC code of up to 15%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Augmented reality assembly guidance is essential for intelligent manufacturing and medical applications, requiring continuous measurement of the 6DoF poses of manipulated objects. Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many phenomena are naturally characterized by measuring continuous transformations such as shape changes in medicine or articulated systems in robotics. Modeling the variability in such datasets requires performing statistics on Lie groups, that is, manifolds carrying an additional group structure. As the Lie group captures the symmetries in the data, it is essential from a theoretical and practical perspective to ask for statistical methods that respect these symmetries; this way they are insensitive to confounding effects, e.g., due to the choice of reference coordinate systems. In this work, we investigate geodesic regression -- a generalization of linear regression originally derived for Riemannian manifolds. While Lie groups can be endowed with Riemannian metrics, these are generally incompatible with the group structure. We develop a non-metric estimator using an affine connection setting. It captures geodesic relationships respecting the symmetries given by left and right translations. For its computation, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm requiring simple differential expressions that can be calculated through automatic differentiation. We perform experiments on a synthetic example and evaluate our method on an open-access, clinical dataset studying knee joint configurations under the progression of osteoarthritis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Ophthalmologists typically require multimodal data sources to improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical decisions. However, due to medical device shortages, low-quality data and data privacy concerns, missing data modalities are common in real-world scenarios. Existing deep learning methods tend to address it by learning an implicit latent subspace representation for different modality combinations. We identify two significant limitations of these methods: (1) implicit representation constraints that hinder the model's ability to capture modality-specific information and (2) modality heterogeneity, causing distribution gaps and redundancy in feature representations. To address these, we propose an Incomplete Modality Disentangled Representation (IMDR) strategy, which disentangles features into explicit independent modal-common and modal-specific features by guidance of mutual information, distilling informative knowledge and enabling it to reconstruct valuable missing semantics and produce robust multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a joint proxy learning module that assists IMDR in eliminating intra-modality redundancy by exploiting the extracted proxies from each class. Experiments on four ophthalmology multimodal datasets demonstrate that the proposed IMDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Location-Routing Problem (LRP), which combines the challenges of facility (depot) locating and vehicle route planning, is critically constrained by the reliance on predefined depot candidates, limiting the solution space and potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. Previous research on LRP without predefined depots is scant and predominantly relies on heuristic algorithms that iteratively attempt depot placements across a planar area. Such approaches lack the ability to proactively generate depot locations that meet specific geographic requirements, revealing a notable gap in current research landscape. To bridge this gap, we propose a data-driven generative DRL framework, designed to proactively generate depots for LRP without predefined depot candidates, solely based on customer requests data which include geographic and demand information. It can operate in two distinct modes: direct generation of exact depot locations, and the creation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution for flexible depots sampling. By extracting depots' geographic pattern from customer requests data, our approach can dynamically respond to logistical needs, identifying high-quality depot locations that further reduce total routing costs compared to traditional methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, for a same group of customer requests, compared with those depots identified through random attempts, our framework can proactively generate depots that lead to superior solution routes with lower routing cost. The implications of our framework potentially extend into real-world applications, particularly in emergency medical rescue and disaster relief logistics, where rapid establishment and adjustment of depot locations are paramount, showcasing its potential in addressing LRP for dynamic and unpredictable environments.</td>

However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains which demand large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, a novel agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a short task description and a repository URL, ToolMaker autonomously installs required dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism to iteratively diagnose and rectify errors. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 diverse and complex computational tasks spanning both medical and non-medical domains with over 100 unit tests to objectively assess tool correctness and robustness. ToolMaker correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown great promise in medical applications, particularly in visual question answering (MedVQA) and diagnosis from medical images. However, existing datasets and models often fail to consider critical aspects of medical diagnostics, such as the integration of historical records and the analysis of disease progression over time. In this paper, we introduce MMXU (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding), a novel dataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions between two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address single-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both current and historical patient data. We demonstrate the limitations of current LVLMs in identifying disease progression on MMXU-\textit{test}, even those that perform well on traditional benchmarks. To address this, we propose a MedRecord-Augmented Generation (MAG) approach, incorporating both global and regional historical records. Our experiments show that integrating historical records significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy by at least 20\%, bridging the gap between current LVLMs and human expert performance. Additionally, we fine-tune models with MAG on MMXU-\textit{dev}, which demonstrates notable improvements. We hope this work could illuminate the avenue of advancing the use of LVLMs in medical diagnostics by emphasizing the importance of historical context in interpreting medical images.

Existing methods often require retraining or modifications to pre-trained models, which is impractical for clinical applications. This study introduces a post-hoc normalizing flow-based approach that seamlessly integrates with pre-trained models. By leveraging normalizing flows, it estimates the likelihood of feature vectors extracted from pre-trained models, capturing semantically meaningful representations without relying on pixel-level statistics. The method was evaluated using the MedMNIST benchmark and a newly curated MedOOD dataset simulating clinically relevant distributional shifts. Performance was measured using standard OOD detection metrics (e.g., AUROC, FPR@95, AUPR_IN, AUPR_OUT), with statistical analyses comparing it against ten baseline methods. On MedMNIST, the proposed model achieved an AUROC of 93.80%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. On MedOOD, it achieved an AUROC of 84.61%, demonstrating superior performance against other methods. Its post-hoc nature ensures compatibility with existing clinical workflows, addressing the limitations of previous approaches.
