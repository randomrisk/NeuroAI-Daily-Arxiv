<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in foundation models have transformed computer vision, driving significant performance improvements across diverse domains, including digital histopathology. However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Rotational symmetry is a defining feature of many tomography systems, including computed tomography (CT) and emission computed tomography (ECT), where detectors are arranged in a circular or periodically rotating configuration. This study revisits the image reconstruction process from the perspective of hardware-induced rotational symmetry and introduces a cyclic group equivariance framework for deep learning-based reconstruction. Specifically, we derive a mathematical correspondence that couples cyclic rotations in the projection domain to discrete rotations in the image domain, both arising from the same cyclic group inherent in the hardware design. This insight also reveals the uniformly distributed circular structure of the projection space. Building on this principle, we provide a cyclic rotation equivariant convolution design method to preserve projection domain symmetry and a cyclic group equivariance regularization approach that enforces consistent rotational transformations across the entire network. We further integrate these modules into a domain transform reconstruction framework and validate them using digital brain phantoms, training on discrete models and testing on more complex and realistic fuzzy variants. Results indicate markedly improved generalization and stability, with fewer artifacts and better detail preservation, especially under data distribution deviation. These findings highlight the potential of cyclic group equivariance as a unifying principle for tomographic reconstruction in rotationally symmetric systems, offering a flexible and interpretable solution for scenarios with limited data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How to mitigate negative transfer in transfer learning is a long-standing and challenging issue, especially in the application of medical image segmentation. Existing methods for reducing negative transfer focus on classification or regression tasks, ignoring the non-uniform negative transfer risk in different image regions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective weighted fine-tuning method that directs the model's attention towards regions with significant transfer risk for medical semantic segmentation. Specifically, we compute a transferability-guided transfer risk map to quantify the transfer hardness for each pixel and the potential risks of negative transfer. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a map-weighted loss function, normalized with image foreground size to counter class imbalance. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation datasets show our method significantly improves the target task performance, with gains of 4.37% on FeTS2021 and 1.81% on iSeg2019, avoiding negative transfer across modalities and tasks. Meanwhile, a 2.9% gain under a few-shot scenario validates the robustness of our approach.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Segmentation of brain tumors is a critical step in treatment planning, yet manual segmentation is both time-consuming and subjective, relying heavily on the expertise of radiologists. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this challenge is magnified by overburdened medical systems and limited access to advanced imaging modalities and expert radiologists. Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning offers a promising solution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially the U-Net architecture, have shown significant potential. However, a major challenge remains: achieving generalizability across different datasets. This study addresses this gap by developing a deep learning ensemble that integrates UNet3D, V-Net, and MSA-VNet models for the semantic segmentation of gliomas. By initially training on the BraTS-GLI dataset and fine-tuning with the BraTS-SSA dataset, we enhance model performance. Our ensemble approach significantly outperforms individual models, achieving DICE scores of 0.8358 for Tumor Core, 0.8521 for Whole Tumor, and 0.8167 for Enhancing Tumor. These results underscore the potential of ensemble methods in improving the accuracy and reliability of automated brain tumor segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we study a nonlinearly coupled initial-boundary value problem describing the evolution of brain tumor growth including lactate metabolism. In our modeling approach, we also take into account the viscoelastic properties of the tissues as well as the reversible damage effects that could occur, possibly caused by surgery. After introducing the PDE system, coupling a Fischer-Kolmogorov type equation for the tumor phase with a reaction-diffusion equation for the lactate, a quasi-static momentum balance with nonlinear elasticity and viscosity matrices, and a nonlinear differential inclusion for the damage, we prove the existence of global in time weak solutions under reasonable assumptions on the involved functions and data. Strengthening these assumptions, we subsequently prove further regularity properties of the solutions as well as their continuous dependence with respect to the data, entailing the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem associated with the nonlinear PDE system.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep generative models and synthetic medical data have shown significant promise in addressing key challenges in healthcare, such as privacy concerns, data bias, and the scarcity of realistic datasets. While research in this area has grown rapidly and demonstrated substantial theoretical potential, its practical adoption in clinical settings remains limited. Despite the benefits synthetic data offers, questions surrounding its reliability and credibility persist, leading to a lack of trust among clinicians. This position paper argues that fostering trust in synthetic medical data is crucial for its clinical adoption. It aims to spark a discussion on the viability of synthetic medical data in clinical practice, particularly in the context of current advancements in AI. We present empirical evidence from brain tumor segmentation to demonstrate that the quality, diversity, and proportion of synthetic data directly impact trust in clinical AI models. Our findings provide insights to improve the deployment and acceptance of synthetic data-driven AI systems in real-world clinical workflows.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spatial transformations that capture population-level morphological statistics are critical for medical image analysis. Commonly used smoothness regularizers for image registration fail to integrate population statistics, leading to anatomically inconsistent transformations. Inverse consistency regularizers promote geometric consistency but lack population morphometrics integration. Regularizers that constrain deformation to low-dimensional manifold methods address this. However, they prioritize reconstruction over interpretability and neglect diffeomorphic properties, such as group composition and inverse consistency. We introduce MORPH-LER, a Log-Euclidean regularization framework for population-aware unsupervised image registration. MORPH-LER learns population morphometrics from spatial transformations to guide and regularize registration networks, ensuring anatomically plausible deformations. It features a bottleneck autoencoder that computes the principal logarithm of deformation fields via iterative square-root predictions. It creates a linearized latent space that respects diffeomorphic properties and enforces inverse consistency. By integrating a registration network with a diffeomorphic autoencoder, MORPH-LER produces smooth, meaningful deformation fields. The framework offers two main contributions: (1) a data-driven regularization strategy that incorporates population-level anatomical statistics to enhance transformation validity and (2) a linearized latent space that enables compact and interpretable deformation fields for efficient population morphometrics analysis. We validate MORPH-LER across two families of deep learning-based registration networks, demonstrating its ability to produce anatomically accurate, computationally efficient, and statistically meaningful transformations on the OASIS-1 brain imaging dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose ReMiDi, a novel method for inferring neuronal microstructure as arbitrary 3D meshes using a differentiable diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) simulator. We first implemented in PyTorch a differentiable dMRI simulator that simulates the forward diffusion process using a finite-element method on an input 3D microstructure mesh. To achieve significantly faster simulations, we solve the differential equation semi-analytically using a matrix formalism approach. Given a reference dMRI signal $S_{ref}$, we use the differentiable simulator to iteratively update the input mesh such that it matches $S_{ref}$ using gradient-based learning. Since directly optimizing the 3D coordinates of the vertices is challenging, particularly due to ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we instead optimize a lower-dimensional latent space representation of the mesh. The mesh is first encoded into spectral coefficients, which are further encoded into a latent $\textbf{z}$ using an auto-encoder, and are then decoded back into the true mesh. We present an end-to-end differentiable pipeline that simulates signals that can be tuned to match a reference signal by iteratively updating the latent representation $\textbf{z}$. We demonstrate the ability to reconstruct microstructures of arbitrary shapes represented by finite-element meshes, with a focus on axonal geometries found in the brain white matter, including bending, fanning and beading fibers.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding neurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the generalizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy regulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) property of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose Domain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning framework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site settings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement, decomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data specificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning module enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We evaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its generalizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an enhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional connectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively, uncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings highlight the potential of DAFed to advance multi-site collaborative research in neuroimaging while protecting data confidentiality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Listeners adapt language comprehension based on their mental representations of speakers, but how these representations are dynamically updated remains unclear. We investigated whether listeners probabilistically adapt their comprehension based on the likelihood of speakers producing stereotype-incongruent utterances. Our findings reveal two potential mechanisms: a speaker-general mechanism that adjusts overall expectations about speaker-content relationships, and a speaker-specific mechanism that updates individual speaker models. In two EEG experiments, participants heard speakers make stereotype-congruent or incongruent utterances, with incongruency base rate manipulated between blocks. In Experiment 1, speaker incongruency modulated both high-beta (21-30 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) oscillations: incongruent utterances decreased oscillatory power in low base rate condition but increased it in high base rate condition. The theta effect varied with listeners' openness trait: less open participants showed theta increases to speaker-incongruencies, suggesting maintenance of speaker-specific information, while more open participants showed theta decreases, indicating flexible model updating. In Experiment 2, we dissociated base rate from the target speaker by manipulating the overall base rate using an alternative non-target speaker. Only the high-beta effect persisted, showing power decrease for speaker-incongruencies in low base rate condition but no effect in high base rate condition. The high-beta oscillations might reflect the speaker-general adjustment, while theta oscillations may index the speaker-specific model updating. These findings provide evidence for how language processing is shaped by social cognition in real time.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As a type of multi-dimensional sequential data, the spatial and temporal dependencies of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals should be further investigated. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal progressive attention model (STPAM) to improve EEG classification in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks. STPAM first adopts three distinct spatial experts to learn the spatial topological information of brain regions progressively, which is used to minimize the interference of irrelevant brain regions. Concretely, the former expert filters out EEG electrodes in the relative brain regions to be used as prior knowledge for the next expert, ensuring that the subsequent experts gradually focus their attention on information from significant EEG electrodes. This process strengthens the effect of the important brain regions. Then, based on the above-obtained feature sequence with spatial information, three temporal experts are adopted to capture the temporal dependence by progressively assigning attention to the crucial EEG slices. Except for the above EEG classification method, in this paper, we build a novel Infrared RSVP EEG Dataset (IRED) which is based on dim infrared images with small targets for the first time, and conduct extensive experiments on it. The results show that our STPAM can achieve better performance than all the compared methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotions play a crucial role in human behavior and decision-making, making emotion recognition a key area of interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

In this paper, a novel SSRepL and Transfer Learning (TL)-based framework that incorporates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) model is proposed to detect children with potential symptoms of ADHD. This model uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals extracted during visual attention tasks to accurately detect ADHD by preprocessing EEG signal quality through normalization, filtering, and data balancing. For the experimental analysis, we use three different models: 1) SSRepL and TL-based LSTM-GRU model named as SSRepL-ADHD, which integrates LSTM and GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data, 2) lightweight SSRepL-based DNN model (LSSRepL-DNN), and 3) Random Forest (RF). In the study, these models are thoroughly evaluated using well-known performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). The results show that the proposed SSRepL-ADHD model achieves the maximum accuracy of 81.11% while admitting the difficulties associated with dataset imbalance and feature selection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce a novel framework that integrates Hodge decomposition with Filtered Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity to analyze dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in EEG signals. This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures. Our analysis of Alzheimer-related MCI patients show significant temporal differences related to higher-order interactions that a pairwise analysis on its own does not implicate. This allows us for the first time to capture higher-dimensional interactions at high temporal resolution in noisy EEG signal recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>P300 is an Event-Related Potential widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces, but its detection is challenging due to inter-subject and temporal variability. This work introduces a clustering methodology based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to extract the P300 structure, ensuring robustness against variability. We propose a novel signal-to-ASCII transformation to generate compression-friendly objects, which are then clustered using a hierarchical tree-based method and a multidimensional projection approach. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the method's ability to reveal relevant P300 structures, showing clustering performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, analysis at the electrode level suggests that the method could assist in electrode selection for P300 detection. This compression-driven clustering methodology offers a complementary tool for EEG analysis and P300 identification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Flow, a state of deep task engagement, is associated with optimal experience and well-being, making its detection a prolific HCI research focus. While physiological sensors show promise for flow detection, most studies are lab-based. Furthermore, brain sensing during natural work remains unexplored due to the intrusive nature of traditional EEG setups. This study addresses this gap by using wearable, around-the-ear EEG sensors to observe flow during natural knowledge work, measuring EEG throughout an entire day. In a semi-controlled field experiment, participants engaged in academic writing or programming, with their natural flow experiences compared to those from a classic lab paradigm. Our results show that natural work tasks elicit more intense flow than artificial tasks, albeit with smaller experience contrasts. EEG results show a well-known quadratic relationship between theta power and flow across tasks, and a novel quadratic relationship between beta asymmetry and flow during complex, real-world tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject variability in EEG degrades performance of current deep learning models, limiting the development of brain-computer interface (BCI). This paper proposes ISAM-MTL, which is a multi-task learning (MTL) EEG classification model based on identifiable spiking (IS) representations and associative memory (AM) networks. The proposed model treats EEG classification of each subject as an independent task and leverages cross-subject data training to facilitate feature sharing across subjects. ISAM-MTL consists of a spiking feature extractor that captures shared features across subjects and a subject-specific bidirectional associative memory network that is trained by Hebbian learning for efficient and fast within-subject EEG classification. ISAM-MTL integrates learned spiking neural representations with bidirectional associative memory for cross-subject EEG classification. The model employs label-guided variational inference to construct identifiable spike representations, enhancing classification accuracy. Experimental results on two BCI Competition datasets demonstrate that ISAM-MTL improves the average accuracy of cross-subject EEG classification while reducing performance variability among subjects. The model further exhibits the characteristics of few-shot learning and identifiable neural activity beneath EEG, enabling rapid and interpretable calibration for BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) present a promising avenue by translating neural activity directly into text, eliminating the need for physical actions. However, existing non-invasive BCI systems have not successfully covered the entire alphabet, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose a novel non-invasive EEG-based BCI system with Curriculum-based Neural Spelling Framework, which recognizes all 26 alphabet letters by decoding neural signals associated with handwriting first, and then apply a Generative AI (GenAI) to enhance spell-based neural language decoding tasks. Our approach combines the ease of handwriting with the accessibility of EEG technology, utilizing advanced neural decoding algorithms and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to translate EEG patterns into text with high accuracy. This system show how GenAI can improve the performance of typical spelling-based neural language decoding task, and addresses the limitations of previous methods, offering a scalable and user-friendly solution for individuals with communication impairments, thereby enhancing inclusive communication options.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) enables direct brain-to-device communication, with the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm favored for its stability and high accuracy across various fields. In SSVEP BCI systems, supervised learning models significantly enhance performance over unsupervised models, achieving higher accuracy in less time. However, prolonged data collection can cause user fatigue and even trigger photosensitive epilepsy, creating a negative user experience. Thus, reducing calibration time is crucial. To address this, Cross-Stimulus transfer learning (CSTL) can shorten calibration by utilizing only partial frequencies. Traditional CSTL methods, affected by time-domain impulse response variations, are suitable only for adjacent frequency transfers, limiting their general applicability. We introduce an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) Based Fuzzy Model (EMD-Fuzzy), which employs EMD to extract crucial frequency information and achieves stimulus transfer in the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to mitigate time-domain differences. Combined with a Fuzzy Decoder that uses fuzzy logic for representation learning, our approach delivers promising preliminary results in offline tests and state-of-the-art performance. With only 4 frequencies, our method achieved an accuracy of 82.75% (16.30%) and an information transfer rate (ITR) of 186.56 (52.09) bits/min on the 40-target Benchmark dataset. In online tests, our method demonstrates robust efficacy, achieving an averaged accuracy of 86.30% (6.18%) across 7 subjects. This performance underscores the effectiveness of integrating EMD and fuzzy logic into EEG decoding for CSTL and highlights our method's potential in real-time applications where consistent and reliable decoding is crucial.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current AI frameworks for brain decoding and encoding, typically train and test models within the same datasets. This limits their utility for brain computer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies not seen during training. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems. This opens the door to future personalised simulations of brain function.

While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The decoding of continuously spoken speech from neuronal activity has the potential to become an important clinical solution for paralyzed patients. Deep Learning Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have recently successfully mapped neuronal activity to text contents in subjects who attempted to formulate speech. However, only small BCI datasets are available. In contrast, labeled data and pre-trained models for the closely related task of speech recognition from audio are widely available. One such model is Wav2Vec2 which has been trained in a self-supervised fashion to create meaningful representations of speech audio data. In this study, we show that patterns learned by Wav2Vec2 are transferable to brain data. Specifically, we replace its audio feature extractor with an untrained Brain Feature Extractor (BFE) model. We then execute full fine-tuning with pre-trained weights for Wav2Vec2, training ''from scratch'' without pre-trained weights as well as freezing a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 and training only the BFE each for 45 different BFE architectures. Across these experiments, the best run is from full fine-tuning with pre-trained weights, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 18.54\%, outperforming the best training from scratch run by 20.46\% and that of frozen Wav2Vec2 training by 15.92\% percentage points. These results indicate that knowledge transfer from audio speech recognition to brain decoding is possible and significantly improves brain decoding performance for the same architectures.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews.</td>

Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question "what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain--computer interfaces are groundbreaking technology whereby brain signals are used to control external devices. Despite some advances in recent years, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor-imagery tasks face challenges, such as amplitude and phase variability and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller models and faster inference. In this study, we develop a prototype, called the Lightweight Geometric Learning Brain--Computer Interface (LGL-BCI), which uses our customized geometric deep learning architecture for swift model inference without sacrificing accuracy. LGL-BCI contains an EEG channel selection module via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a symmetric positive definite matrix, providing adaptiveness among the continuously changing EEG signal. Meanwhile, a built-in lossless transformation helps boost the inference speed. The performance of our solution was evaluated using two real-world EEG devices and two public EEG datasets. LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency. These findings underscore both the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of LGL-BCI, demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of geometric deep learning in motor-imagery brain--computer interface applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding neurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the generalizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy regulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) property of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose Domain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning framework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site settings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement, decomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data specificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning module enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We evaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its generalizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an enhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional connectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively, uncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings highlight the potential of DAFed to advance multi-site collaborative research in neuroimaging while protecting data confidentiality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) visual decoding involves decoding the original image from brain signals elicited by visual stimuli. This often relies on manually labeled ROIs (Regions of Interest) to select brain voxels. However, these ROIs can contain redundant information and noise, reducing decoding performance. Additionally, the lack of automated ROI labeling methods hinders the practical application of fMRI visual decoding technology, especially for new subjects. This work presents TROI (Trainable Region of Interest), a novel two-stage, data-driven ROI labeling method for cross-subject fMRI decoding tasks, particularly when subject samples are limited. TROI leverages labeled ROIs in the dataset to pretrain an image decoding backbone on a cross-subject dataset, enabling efficient optimization of the input layer for new subjects without retraining the entire model from scratch. In the first stage, we introduce a voxel selection method that combines sparse mask training and low-pass filtering to quickly generate the voxel mask and determine input layer dimensions. In the second stage, we apply a learning rate rewinding strategy to fine-tune the input layer for downstream tasks. Experimental results on the same small sample dataset as the baseline method for brain visual retrieval and reconstruction tasks show that our voxel selection method surpasses the state-of-the-art method MindEye2 with an annotated ROI mask.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how brain networks recruit resources during cognitive tasks is key to explaining individual differences in task performance. Brain network parameters-including activity levels of regions and their connectivity-reflect the integration and segregation of functional subnetworks underlying task processing. However, the complexity and high dimensionality of these parameters pose a significant barrier to identifying functionally relevant individual differences. Here, we introduce stiff-sloppy analysis as a framework for uncovering the stiff parameter combinations that critically influence task-state brain dynamics, exemplified by working memory. Using the pairwise maximum entropy model (PMEM) calibrated to fMRI data and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) analysis, we reveal that the stiff dimensions of the model parameters capture the most relevant integration and segregation processes of the default mode network and the working memory network. Individual differences along these stiff neural dimensions consistently correlate with working memory performance. Notably, stiff parameters robustly predicted working memory performance, even when the less sensitive ("sloppy") parameters were excluded. This study establishes stiff-sloppy analysis as a powerful approach to identify cognition-related brain networks, bridging neural dynamics and behavior and offering new avenues for personalized neuroscience including therapeutic innovation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current AI frameworks for brain decoding and encoding, typically train and test models within the same datasets. This limits their utility for brain computer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies not seen during training. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems. This opens the door to future personalised simulations of brain function.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generative AI has recently propelled the decoding of images from brain activity. How do these approaches scale with the amount and type of neural recordings? Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this article we use the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) to train a family of feature-weighted receptive field neural encoding models. These models use a pre-trained vision or text backbone and map extracted features to the voxel space via receptive field readouts. We comprehensively assess such models, quantifying performance changes based on using different modalities like text or images, toggling finetuning, using different pre-trained backbones, and changing the width of the readout. We also dissect each model using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as feature visualization via input optimization, also referred to as ``dreaming'' in the AI literature, and the integrated gradients approach to calculate implicit attention maps to illustrate which features drive the predicted signal in different brain areas. These XAI tools illustrate biologically plausible features that drive the predicted signal. Traversing the model hyperparameter space reveals the existence of a maximally minimal model, balancing simplicity while maintaining performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing perceived images from human brain activity forms a crucial link between human and machine learning through Brain-Computer Interfaces. Early methods primarily focused on training separate models for each individual to account for individual variability in brain activity, overlooking valuable cross-subject commonalities. Recent advancements have explored multisubject methods, but these approaches face significant challenges, particularly in data privacy and effectively managing individual variability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce BrainGuard, a privacy-preserving collaborative training framework designed to enhance image reconstruction from multisubject fMRI data while safeguarding individual privacy. BrainGuard employs a collaborative global-local architecture where individual models are trained on each subject's local data and operate in conjunction with a shared global model that captures and leverages cross-subject patterns. This architecture eliminates the need to aggregate fMRI data across subjects, thereby ensuring privacy preservation. To tackle the complexity of fMRI data, BrainGuard integrates a hybrid synchronization strategy, enabling individual models to dynamically incorporate parameters from the global model. By establishing a secure and collaborative training environment, BrainGuard not only protects sensitive brain data but also improves the image reconstructions accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BrainGuard sets a new benchmark in both high-level and low-level metrics, advancing the state-of-the-art in brain decoding through its innovative design.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.   The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.   This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to universal jailbreaks-prompting strategies that systematically bypass model safeguards and enable users to carry out harmful processes that require many model interactions, like manufacturing illegal substances at scale. To defend against these attacks, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers: safeguards trained on synthetic data, generated by prompting LLMs with natural language rules (i.e., a constitution) specifying permitted and restricted content. In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks. These classifiers also maintain deployment viability, with an absolute 0.38% increase in production-traffic refusals and a 23.7% inference overhead. Our work demonstrates that defending against universal jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment viability is tractable.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Journalism has emerged as an essential domain for understanding the uses, limitations, and impacts of large language models (LLMs) in the workplace. News organizations face divergent financial incentives: LLMs already permeate newswork processes within financially constrained organizations, even as ongoing legal challenges assert that AI companies violate their copyright. At stake are key questions about what LLMs are created to do, and by whom: How might a journalist-led LLM work, and what can participatory design illuminate about the present-day challenges about adapting ``one-size-fits-all'' foundation models to a given context of use? In this paper, we undertake a co-design exploration to understand how a participatory approach to LLMs might address opportunities and challenges around AI in journalism. Our 20 interviews with reporters, data journalists, editors, labor organizers, product leads, and executives highlight macro, meso, and micro tensions that designing for this opportunity space must address. From these desiderata, we describe the result of our co-design work: organizational structures and functionality for a journalist-controlled LLM. In closing, we discuss the limitations of commercial foundation models for workplace use, and the methodological implications of applying participatory methods to LLM co-design.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) is expected in a diverse set of new physics scenarios. The current generation of experiments probe CLFV in the muon sector in three complementary channels: $\mu^-N \rightarrow e^- N$ (Mu2e, COMET), $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma$ (MEG-II), and $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^+e^-$s (Mu3e). These experiments aim to enhance existing limits by several orders-of-magnitude in the coming decade and offer discovery potential to many new physics models. The proposed Advanced Muon Facility (AMF) would be a multi-purpose muon facility based at Fermilab and introduces an innovative approach based on a muon storage ring to enable a full suite of muon CLFV experiments. AMF would host CLFV experiments with sensitivities orders-of-magnitude beyond the present era. In the event of a signal in these currently planned experiments, AMF would enable additional measurements to elucidate the nature of the new physics observed. The design and R$\&$D for AMF is in its infancy. This article outlines the motivations for AMF, detailing on-going R$\&$D efforts, and highlighting potential synergies with the proposed muon collider.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lepton flavor violation (LFV) offers a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, particularly in models addressing neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this study, we investigate LFV processes within the framework of type II seesaw leptogenesis, where the Standard Model is extended by an $SU(2)_L$ triplet Higgs field. We focus on key LFV processes including $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$, $\mu^+ \to e^+e^-e^+$, and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion in nuclei, deriving stringent constraints on the parameter space from current experimental data. We scan the 3$\sigma$ range of neutrino oscillation parameters and identify the most conservative bounds consistent with existing measurements. Our results reveal that the MEG experiment currently provides the strongest constraints in the normal ordering (NO) scenario, while the SINDRUM experiment offers comparable sensitivity in the inverted ordering (IO) case. Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e, and COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing larger regions of the parameter space. This work underscores the crucial role of LFV experiments in probing type II seesaw leptogenesis, providing an avenue to explore the connections between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and inflation at experimentally accessible energy scales.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques in multi-view settings face significant challenges, particularly when integrating heterogeneous data, aligning feature spaces, and managing view-specific biases. These issues are prominent in neuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are analyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), where signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's underlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are assumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View Independent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across subjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual variability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a temporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory stimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays alone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to differ across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a model with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in closed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms existing multi-view ICA methods. We further validate its effectiveness using the Cam-CAN dataset, and showing how delays and dilations are related to aging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The resting-state brain networks (RSNs) reflects the functional connectivity patterns between brain modules, providing essential foundations for decoding intrinsic neural information within the brain. It serves as one of the primary tools for describing the spatial dynamics of the brain using various neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the distribution rules or potential modes of functional connectivity weights in the resting state remain unclear. In this context, we first start from simulation, using forward solving model to generate scalp EEG with four channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128). Subsequently, we construct scalp brain networks using five coupling measures, aiming to explore whether different channel density or coupling measures affect the distribution pattern of functional connectivity weights. Next, we quantify the distribution pattern by calculating the skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy of the functional connectivity network weights. Finally, the results of the simulation were validated in a normative database. We observed that: 1) The functional connection weights exhibit a right-skewed distribution, and are not influenced by channel density or coupling measures; 2) The functional connection weights exhibit a relatively uniform distribution, with the potential for volume conduction to affect the degree of uniformity in the distribution; 3) Networks constructed using coupling measures influenced by volume conduction exhibit significant correlations between the average connection weight and measures of skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of RSNs, providing valuable insights for research in the field of neuroscience, and holds promise for being associated with brain cognition and disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent experimental results from the Atomki collaboration have reported the observation of anomalous effects in Beryllium, Helium and Carbon nuclear transitions that could hint at physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the MEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the Beryllium transition ${^8}\text{Be}^\star\to{^8}\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of this result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations of the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$ with mass around $17\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of a spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was initially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous signal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the SINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon anomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fundamental question in data-driven decision making is how to quantify the uncertainty of predictions in ways that can usefully inform downstream action. This interface between prediction uncertainty and decision-making is especially important in risk-sensitive domains, such as medicine. In this paper, we develop decision-theoretic foundations that connect uncertainty quantification using prediction sets with risk-averse decision-making. Specifically, we answer three fundamental questions: (1) What is the correct notion of uncertainty quantification for risk-averse decision makers? We prove that prediction sets are optimal for decision makers who wish to optimize their value at risk. (2) What is the optimal policy that a risk averse decision maker should use to map prediction sets to actions? We show that a simple max-min decision policy is optimal for risk-averse decision makers. Finally, (3) How can we derive prediction sets that are optimal for such decision makers? We provide an exact characterization in the population regime and a distribution free finite-sample construction. Answering these questions naturally leads to an algorithm, Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC), which follows a provably optimal design for deriving action policies from predictions. RAC is designed to be both practical-capable of leveraging the quality of predictions in a black-box manner to enhance downstream utility-and safe-adhering to a user-defined risk threshold and optimizing the corresponding risk quantile of the user's downstream utility. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages of RAC in applications such as medical diagnosis and recommendation systems. Specifically, we show that RAC achieves a substantially improved trade-off between safety and utility, offering higher utility compared to existing methods while maintaining the safety guarantee.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a medical imaging technique that plays a crucial role in the detailed visualization and identification of tissue perfusion in abnormal lesions and radiological suggestions for biopsy. However, DCE-MRI involves the administration of a Gadolinium based (Gad) contrast agent, which is associated with a risk of toxicity in the body. Previous deep learning approaches that synthesize DCE-MR images employ unimodal non-contrast or low-dose contrast MRI images lacking focus on the local perfusion information within the anatomy of interest. We propose AAD-DCE, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with an aggregated attention discriminator module consisting of global and local discriminators. The discriminators provide a spatial embedded attention map to drive the generator to synthesize early and late response DCE-MRI images. Our method employs multimodal inputs - T2 weighted (T2W), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), and T1 pre-contrast for image synthesis. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on the ProstateX dataset show that our model (i) is agnostic to various generator benchmarks and (ii) outperforms other DCE-MRI synthesis approaches with improvement margins of +0.64 dB PSNR, +0.0518 SSIM, -0.015 MAE for early response and +0.1 dB PSNR, +0.0424 SSIM, -0.021 MAE for late response, and (ii) emphasize the importance of attention ensembling.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Several studies indicate that deep learning models can learn to detect breast cancer from mammograms (X-ray images of the breasts). However, challenges with overfitting and poor generalisability prevent their routine use in the clinic. Models trained on data from one patient population may not perform well on another due to differences in their data domains, emerging due to variations in scanning technology or patient characteristics. Data augmentation techniques can be used to improve generalisability by expanding the diversity of feature representations in the training data by altering existing examples. Image-to-image translation models are one approach capable of imposing the characteristic feature representations (i.e. style) of images from one dataset onto another. However, evaluating model performance is non-trivial, particularly in the absence of ground truths (a common reality in medical imaging). Here, we describe some key aspects that should be considered when evaluating style transfer algorithms, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of popular metrics, and important factors to be mindful of when implementing them in practice. We consider two types of generative models: a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) and a diffusion-based SynDiff model. We learn unpaired image-to-image translation across three mammography datasets. We highlight that undesirable aspects of model performance may determine the suitability of some metrics, and also provide some analysis indicating the extent to which various metrics assess unique aspects of model performance. We emphasise the need to use several metrics for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Using extensive training data from SA-1B, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated exceptional generalization and zero-shot capabilities, attracting widespread attention in areas such as medical image segmentation and remote sensing image segmentation. However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks. Extensive experimental results from five datasets (CASIA, Columbia, Coverage, IMD2020, and NIST16) validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quantum computers create new security risks for today's encryption systems. This paper presents an improved version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that uses quantum technology to strengthen protection. Our approach offers two modes: a fully quantum-based method for maximum security and a hybrid version that works with existing infrastructure. The system generates encryption keys using quantum randomness instead of predictable computer algorithms, making keys virtually impossible to guess. It regularly refreshes these keys automatically to block long-term attacks, even as technology advances. Testing confirms the system works seamlessly with current security standards, maintaining fast performance for high-volume data transfers. The upgraded AES keeps its original security benefits while adding three key defenses: quantum-powered key creation, adjustable security settings for different threats, and safeguards against attacks that exploit device vulnerabilities. Organizations can implement this solution in stages--starting with hybrid mode for sensitive data while keeping older systems operational. This phased approach allows businesses to protect financial transactions, medical records, and communication networks today while preparing for more powerful quantum computers in the future. The design prioritizes easy adoption, requiring no costly replacements of existing hardware or software in most cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming an instrumental part of healthcare systems, assisting medical personnel with decision making and results analysis. Models for radiology report generation are able to interpret medical imagery, thus reducing the workload of radiologists. As medical data is scarce and protected by privacy regulations, medical MLLMs represent valuable intellectual property. However, these assets are potentially vulnerable to model stealing, where attackers aim to replicate their functionality via black-box access. So far, model stealing for the medical domain has focused on classification; however, existing attacks are not effective against MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Domain Alignment (ADA-STEAL), the first stealing attack against medical MLLMs. ADA-STEAL relies on natural images, which are public and widely available, as opposed to their medical counterparts. We show that data augmentation with adversarial noise is sufficient to overcome the data distribution gap between natural images and the domain-specific distribution of the victim MLLM. Experiments on the IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR radiology datasets demonstrate that Adversarial Domain Alignment enables attackers to steal the medical MLLM without any access to medical data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Rotational symmetry is a defining feature of many tomography systems, including computed tomography (CT) and emission computed tomography (ECT), where detectors are arranged in a circular or periodically rotating configuration. This study revisits the image reconstruction process from the perspective of hardware-induced rotational symmetry and introduces a cyclic group equivariance framework for deep learning-based reconstruction. Specifically, we derive a mathematical correspondence that couples cyclic rotations in the projection domain to discrete rotations in the image domain, both arising from the same cyclic group inherent in the hardware design. This insight also reveals the uniformly distributed circular structure of the projection space. Building on this principle, we provide a cyclic rotation equivariant convolution design method to preserve projection domain symmetry and a cyclic group equivariance regularization approach that enforces consistent rotational transformations across the entire network. We further integrate these modules into a domain transform reconstruction framework and validate them using digital brain phantoms, training on discrete models and testing on more complex and realistic fuzzy variants. Results indicate markedly improved generalization and stability, with fewer artifacts and better detail preservation, especially under data distribution deviation. These findings highlight the potential of cyclic group equivariance as a unifying principle for tomographic reconstruction in rotationally symmetric systems, offering a flexible and interpretable solution for scenarios with limited data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we extend the SEEDS superpixel algorithm from 2D images to 3D volumes, resulting in 3D SEEDS, a faster, better, and open-source supervoxel algorithm for medical image analysis. We compare 3D SEEDS with the widely used supervoxel algorithm SLIC on 13 segmentation tasks across 10 organs. 3D SEEDS accelerates supervoxel generation by a factor of 10, improves the achievable Dice score by +6.5%, and reduces the under-segmentation error by -0.16%.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate identification of druggable pockets is essential for structure-based drug design. However, most pocket-identification algorithms prioritize their geometric properties over downstream docking performance. To address this limitation, we developed RAPID-Net, a pocket-finding algorithm for seamless integration with docking workflows. When guiding AutoDock Vina, RAPID-Net outperforms DiffBindFR on the PoseBusters benchmark and enables blind docking on large proteins that AlphaFold 3 cannot process as a whole. Furthermore, RAPID-Net surpasses PUResNet and Kalasanty in docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates across diverse datasets, including PoseBusters, Astex Diverse Set, BU48, and Coach420. When accuracy is evaluated as ``at least one correct pose in the ensemble'', RAPID-Net outperforms AlphaFold 3 on the PoseBusters benchmark, suggesting that our approach can be further improved with a suitable pose reweighting tool offering a cost-effective and competitive alternative to AlphaFold 3 for docking. Finally, using several therapeutically relevant examples, we demonstrate the ability of RAPID-Net to identify remote functional sites, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutics.</td>
