<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neurons in the brain show great diversity in their individual properties and their connections to other neurons. To develop an understanding of how neuronal diversity contributes to brain dynamics and function at large scales we borrow from the framework of replica methods, that has been successfully applied to a large class of problems with quenched noise in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We analyze two linearized versions of Wilson-Cowan model with random coefficients which are correlated in space. In particular: (A) a model where the properties of the neurons themselves are heterogeneous and (B) where their connectivities are anisotropic. In both of these models, the averaging over the quenched randomness gives rise to additional nonlinearities. These nonlinearities are analyzed within the framework of Wilsonian renormalization group. We find that for Model A, if the spatial correlation of noise decays with distance with an exponent smaller than $-2$, at large spatial scales the effect of the noise vanishes. By contrast, for model B, the effect of noise in neuronal connectivity vanishes only if the spatial correlations decay with an exponent smaller than $-1$. Our calculations also suggest that the presence of noise, under certain conditions, can give rise to travelling wave like behavior at large scales, although it remains to be seen whether this result remains valid at higher orders in perturbation theory.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved new levels of performance and spread in public usage with the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs). Initially inspired by human neurons and their connections, NNs have become the foundation of AI models for many advanced architectures. However, some of the most integral processes in the human brain, particularly neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in addition to the more spread neuroapoptosis have largely been ignored in DNN architecture design. Instead, contemporary AI development predominantly focuses on constructing advanced frameworks, such as large language models, which retain a static structure of neural connections during training and inference. In this light, we explore how neurogenesis, neuroapoptosis, and neuroplasticity can inspire future AI advances. Specifically, we examine analogous activities in artificial NNs, introducing the concepts of ``dropin'' for neurogenesis and revisiting ``dropout'' and structural pruning for neuroapoptosis. We additionally suggest neuroplasticity combining the two for future large NNs in ``life-long learning'' settings following the biological inspiration. We conclude by advocating for greater research efforts in this interdisciplinary domain and identifying promising directions for future exploration.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for classifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Few-shot class-incremental Learning (FSCIL) enables models to learn new classes from limited data while retaining performance on previously learned classes. Traditional FSCIL methods often require fine-tuning parameters with limited new class data and suffer from a separation between learning new classes and utilizing old knowledge. Inspired by the analogical learning mechanisms of the human brain, we propose a novel analogical generative method. Our approach includes the Brain-Inspired Analogical Generator (BiAG), which derives new class weights from existing classes without parameter fine-tuning during incremental stages. BiAG consists of three components: Weight Self-Attention Module (WSA), Weight & Prototype Analogical Attention Module (WPAA), and Semantic Conversion Module (SCM). SCM uses Neural Collapse theory for semantic conversion, WSA supplements new class weights, and WPAA computes analogies to generate new class weights. Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher final and average accuracy compared to SOTA methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural manifolds summarize the intrinsic structure of the information encoded by a population of neurons. Advances in experimental techniques have made simultaneous recordings from multiple brain regions increasingly commonplace, raising the possibility of studying how these manifolds relate across populations. However, when the manifolds are nonlinear and possibly code for multiple unknown variables, it is challenging to extract robust and falsifiable information about their relationships. We introduce a framework, called the method of analogous cycles, for matching topological features of neural manifolds using only observed dissimilarity matrices within and between neural populations. We demonstrate via analysis of simulations and \emph{in vivo} experimental data that this method can be used to correctly identify multiple shared circular coordinate systems across both stimuli and inferred neural manifolds. Conversely, the method rejects matching features that are not intrinsic to one of the systems. Further, as this method is deterministic and does not rely on dimensionality reduction or optimization methods, it is amenable to direct mathematical investigation and interpretation in terms of the underlying neural activity. We thus propose the method of analogous cycles as a suitable foundation for a theory of cross-population analysis via neural manifolds.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance imaging, an important biomarker in many neurodegenerative and neurological disorders, are derived by many tools from an initial voxel-wise tissue segmentation. White matter (WM) hypointensities in T1-weighted imaging, such as those arising from multiple sclerosis or small vessel disease, are known to affect the output of brain segmentation methods and therefore bias cortical thickness measurements. These effects are well-documented among traditional brain segmentation tools but have not been studied extensively in tools based on deep-learning segmentations, which promise to be more robust. In this paper, we explore the potential of deep learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cortical thickness measurement in the presence of WM lesions, using a high-quality lesion filling algorithm leveraging denoising diffusion networks.   A pseudo-3D U-Net architecture trained on the OASIS dataset to generate synthetic healthy tissue, conditioned on binary lesion masks derived from the MSSEG dataset, allows realistic removal of white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. By applying morphometry methods to patient images before and after lesion filling, we analysed robustness of global and regional cortical thickness measurements in the presence of white matter lesions. Methods based on a deep learning-based segmentation of the brain (Fastsurfer, DL+DiReCT, ANTsPyNet) exhibited greater robustness than those using classical segmentation methods (Freesurfer, ANTs).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate segmentation of glioma brain tumors is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning techniques offer promising solutions, but optimal model architectures remain under investigation. We used the BraTS 2021 dataset, selecting T1 with contrast enhancement (T1CE), T2, and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences for model development. The proposed Attention Xception UNet (AXUNet) architecture integrates an Xception backbone with dot-product self-attention modules, inspired by state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models such as Google Bard and OpenAI ChatGPT, within a UNet-shaped model. We compared AXUNet with SOTA models. Comparative evaluation on the test set demonstrated improved results over baseline models. Inception-UNet and Xception-UNet achieved mean Dice scores of 90.88 and 93.24, respectively. Attention ResUNet (AResUNet) attained a mean Dice score of 92.80, with the highest score of 84.92 for enhancing tumor (ET) among all models. Attention Gate UNet (AGUNet) yielded a mean Dice score of 90.38. AXUNet outperformed all models with a mean Dice score of 93.73. It demonstrated superior Dice scores across whole tumor (WT) and tumor core (TC) regions, achieving 92.59 for WT, 86.81 for TC, and 84.89 for ET. The integration of the Xception backbone and dot-product self-attention mechanisms in AXUNet showcases enhanced performance in capturing spatial and contextual information. The findings underscore the potential utility of AXUNet in facilitating precise tumor delineation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain uses positive signals as a means of signaling. Forward interactions in the early visual cortex are also positive, realized by excitatory synapses. Only local interactions also include inhibition. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures the biological constraint of positive long-range interactions and can be implemented with stochastic spikes. While NMF can serve as an abstract formalization of early neural processing in the visual system, the performance of deep convolutional networks with NMF modules does not match that of CNNs of similar size. However, when the local NMF modules are each followed by a module that mixes the NMF's positive activities, the performances on the benchmark data exceed that of vanilla deep convolutional networks of similar size. This setting can be considered a biologically more plausible emulation of the processing in cortical (hyper-)columns with the potential to improve the performance of deep networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Depression disorder is a serious health condition that has affected the lives of millions of people around the world. Diagnosis of depression is a challenging practice that relies heavily on subjective studies and, in most cases, suffers from late findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers have been suggested and investigated in recent years as a potential transformative objective practice. In this article, for the first time, a detailed systematic review of EEG-based depression diagnosis approaches is conducted using advanced machine learning techniques and statistical analyses. For this, 938 potentially relevant articles (since 1985) were initially detected and filtered into 139 relevant articles based on the review scheme 'preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA).' This article compares and discusses the selected articles and categorizes them according to the type of machine learning techniques and statistical analyses. Algorithms, preprocessing techniques, extracted features, and data acquisition systems are discussed and summarized. This review paper explains the existing challenges of the current algorithms and sheds light on the future direction of the field. This systematic review outlines the issues and challenges in machine intelligence for the diagnosis of EEG depression that can be addressed in future studies and possibly in future wearable technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject EEG emotion recognition is challenged by significant inter-subject variability and intricately entangled intra-subject variability. Existing works have primarily addressed these challenges through domain adaptation or generalization strategies. However, they typically require extensive target subject data or demonstrate limited generalization performance to unseen subjects. Recent few-shot learning paradigms attempt to address these limitations but often encounter catastrophic overfitting during subject-specific adaptation with limited samples. This article introduces the few-shot adapter with a cross-view fusion method called FACE for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition, which leverages dynamic multi-view fusion and effective subject-specific adaptation. Specifically, FACE incorporates a cross-view fusion module that dynamically integrates global brain connectivity with localized patterns via subject-specific fusion weights to provide complementary emotional information. Moreover, the few-shot adapter module is proposed to enable rapid adaptation for unseen subjects while reducing overfitting by enhancing adapter structures with meta-learning. Experimental results on three public EEG emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate FACE's superior generalization performance over state-of-the-art methods. FACE provides a practical solution for cross-subject scenarios with limited labeled data.</td>

This dataset includes electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and pulse interval (PI) from 64 participants. Data collection employed two emotion induction paradigms: video stimuli that targeted different valence levels (positive, neutral, and negative) and the Mannheim Multicomponent Stress Test (MMST), which induced high arousal through cognitive, emotional, and social stressors. To enrich the dataset, participants' personality traits, anxiety, depression, and emotional states were assessed using validated questionnaires. By capturing a broad spectrum of affective responses while accounting for individual differences, this dataset provides a robust resource for precise emotion modeling. The integration of multimodal physiological data with psychological assessments lays a strong foundation for personalized emotion recognition. We anticipate this resource will support the development of more accurate, adaptive, and individualized emotion recognition systems across diverse applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Computer interfaces are advancing towards using multi-modalities to enable better human-computer interactions. The use of automatic emotion recognition (AER) can make the interactions natural and meaningful thereby enhancing the user experience. Though speech is the most direct and intuitive modality for AER, it is not reliable because it can be intentionally faked by humans. On the other hand, physiological modalities like EEG, are more reliable and impossible to fake. However, use of EEG is infeasible for realistic scenarios usage because of the need for specialized recording setup. In this paper, one of our primary aims is to ride on the reliability of the EEG modality to facilitate robust AER on the speech modality. Our approach uses both the modalities during training to reliably identify emotion at the time of inference, even in the absence of the more reliable EEG modality. We propose, a two-step joint multi-modal learning approach (JMML) that exploits both the intra- and inter- modal characteristics to construct emotion embeddings that enrich the performance of AER. In the first step, using JEC-SSL, intra-modal learning is done independently on the individual modalities. This is followed by an inter-modal learning using the proposed extended variant of deep canonically correlated cross-modal autoencoder (E-DCC-CAE). The approach learns the joint properties of both the modalities by mapping them into a common representation space, such that the modalities are maximally correlated. These emotion embeddings, hold properties of both the modalities there by enhancing the performance of ML classifier used for AER. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach. To best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine speech and EEG with joint multi-modal learning approach for reliable AER.</td>

We create a derivative dataset from this of living vs non-living entities test 15 different deep learning models with 5 different architectures and compare to a SOTA linear model. We show that the linear model is not able to solve the decoding task, while almost all the deep learning models are successful, suggesting that in some cases non-linear models are needed to decode neural representations. We also run a comparative study of the models' performance on individual object categories, and suggest how artificial neural networks can be used to study brain activity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography-based eye tracking (EEG-ET) leverages eye movement artifacts in EEG signals as an alternative to camera-based tracking. While EEG-ET offers advantages such as robustness in low-light conditions and better integration with brain-computer interfaces, its development lags behind traditional methods, particularly in consumer-grade settings. To support research in this area, we present a dataset comprising simultaneous EEG and eye-tracking recordings from 113 participants across 116 sessions, amounting to 11 hours and 45 minutes of recordings. Data was collected using a consumer-grade EEG headset and webcam-based eye tracking, capturing eye movements under four experimental paradigms with varying complexity. The dataset enables the evaluation of EEG-ET methods across different gaze conditions and serves as a benchmark for assessing feasibility with affordable hardware. Data preprocessing includes handling of missing values and filtering to enhance usability. In addition to the dataset, code for data preprocessing and analysis is available to support reproducibility and further research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are currently often trained to only solve a specific task like pathology or gender decoding. A more general approach leveraging the medical reports of clinical EEG recordings is to learn mappings between medical reports and EEG recordings. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework EEG-CLIP that aligns EEG time series and their corresponding clinical text descriptions in a shared embedding space. We investigate its potential for versatile EEG decoding, assessing performance on a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, results show that EEG-CLIP manages to nontrivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the rapid advancement of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, the volume of physiological data generated in related research and applications has grown significantly. Data is a critical resource in BCI research and a key factor in the development of BCI technology, making efficient storage and management of this data increasingly vital. In the realm of research, ample data can facilitate the development of novel algorithms, which can be more accurately validated. In terms of applications, well-organized data can foster the emergence of new business opportunities, thereby maximizing the commercial value of the data. Currently, there are two major challenges in the storage and management of BCI data: providing different classification storage modes for multi-modal data, and adapting to varying application scenarios while improving storage strategies. To address these challenges, this study has developed the NeuroStore BCI data persistence system, which provides a general and easily scalable data model and can effectively handle multiple types of data storage. The system has a flexible distributed framework and can be widely applied to various scenarios. It has been utilized as the core support platform for efficient data storage and management services in the "BCI Controlled Robot Contest in World Robot Contest."</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Patients with extreme forms of paralysis face challenges in communication, adversely impacting their quality of life. Recent studies have reported higher-than-chance performance in decoding handwritten letters from EEG signals, potentially allowing these subjects to communicate. However, all prior works have attempted to decode handwriting from EEG during actual motion. Furthermore, they assume that precise movement-onset is known. In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The large volume of electroencephalograph (EEG) data produced by brain-computer interface (BCI) systems presents challenges for rapid transmission over bandwidth-limited channels in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems traditionally used in medicine and designed to interact with the brain to record or stimulate neurons. Despite their benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on neurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In this context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt spontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition. Previous work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced number of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this limitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of the primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons, tested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting gratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus, also testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results, based on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the attacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and fixed events are the most robust. Although both attacks can significantly affect neural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal delays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many neurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO increased with the number of neurons attacked.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The emergence of vision-language-action (VLA) models has given rise to foundation models for robot manipulation. Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</td>

This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative communication methods for individuals with motor disabilities by allowing control and interaction with external devices. Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness.</td>

Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training without direct data sharing. Model-heterogeneous FL (MHFL) extends this paradigm by allowing clients to train personalized models with heterogeneous architectures tailored to their computational resources and application-specific needs. However, existing MHFL methods predominantly rely on centralized aggregation, which introduces scalability and efficiency bottlenecks, or impose restrictions requiring partially identical model architectures across clients. While peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes server dependence, it suffers from model drift and knowledge dilution, limiting its effectiveness in heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedSKD, a novel MHFL framework that facilitates direct knowledge exchange through round-robin model circulation, eliminating the need for centralized aggregation while allowing fully heterogeneous model architectures across clients. FedSKD's key innovation lies in multi-dimensional similarity knowledge distillation, which enables bidirectional cross-client knowledge transfer at batch, pixel/voxel, and region levels for heterogeneous models in FL. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and model drift through progressive reinforcement and distribution alignment while preserving model heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on fMRI-based autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and skin lesion classification demonstrate that FedSKD outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous FL baselines, achieving superior personalization (client-specific accuracy) and generalization (cross-institutional adaptability). These findings underscore FedSKD's potential as a scalable and robust solution for real-world medical federated learning applications.</td>

Quantifying functional correspondences in the visual cortex across species can help us understand how information is processed in the primate visual cortex, while also providing deeper insights into human visual cortex functions through the study of marmosets. In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the organization of human brain networks has become a central focus in neuroscience, particularly in the study of functional connectivity, which plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques have significantly improved brain network analysis. However, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex relationships between brain regions, while deep learning methods, particularly Transformer-based models, face computational challenges due to their quadratic complexity in long-sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Core-Periphery State-Space Model (CP-SSM), an innovative framework for functional connectome classification. Specifically, we introduce Mamba, a selective state-space model with linear complexity, to effectively capture long-range dependencies in functional brain networks. Furthermore, inspired by the core-periphery (CP) organization, a fundamental characteristic of brain networks that enhances efficient information transmission, we design CP-MoE, a CP-guided Mixture-of-Experts that improves the representation learning of brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate CP-SSM on two benchmark fMRI datasets: ABIDE and ADNI. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-SSM surpasses Transformer-based models in classification performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-SSM in modeling brain functional connectivity, offering a promising direction for neuroimaging-based neurological disease diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how neural dynamics shape cognitive experiences remains a central challenge in neuroscience and psychiatry. Here, we present a novel framework leveraging state-to-output controllability from dynamical systems theory to model the interplay between cognitive perturbations, neural activity, and subjective experience. We demonstrate that large-scale fMRI signals are constrained to low-dimensional manifolds, where affective and cognitive states are naturally organized. Furthermore, we provide a theoretically robust method to estimate the controllability Gramian from steady-state neural responses, offering a direct measure of the energy required to steer cognitive outcomes. In five healthy participants viewing 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos, our analyses reveal a strong alignment between neural activations and affective ratings, with an average correlation of $r \approx 0.7$. In a clinical cohort of 255 patients with major depressive disorder, biweekly Hamilton Rating Scale trajectories over 11 weeks significantly mapped onto these manifolds, explaining approximately 20% more variance than chance ($p < 10^{-10}$, numerically better than chance in 93% reaching statistical significance in one-third of subjects). Our work bridges dynamical systems theory and clinical neuroscience, providing a principled approach to optimize mental health treatments by targeting the most efficient neural pathways for cognitive change.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Estimating brain effective connectivity (EC) from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can aid in comprehending the neural mechanisms underlying human behavior and cognition, providing a foundation for disease diagnosis. However, current spatiotemporal attention modules handle temporal and spatial attention separately, extracting temporal and spatial features either sequentially or in parallel. These approaches overlook the inherent spatiotemporal correlations present in real world fMRI data. Additionally, the presence of noise in fMRI data further limits the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel brain effective connectivity estimation method based on Fourier spatiotemporal attention (FSTA-EC), which combines Fourier attention and spatiotemporal attention to simultaneously capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal) dependencies from high-noise fMRI data. Specifically, Fourier attention is designed to convert the high-noise fMRI data to frequency domain, and map the denoised fMRI data back to physical domain, and spatiotemporal attention is crafted to simultaneously learn spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, through a series of proofs, we demonstrate that incorporating learnable filter into fast Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform processes is mathematically equivalent to performing cyclic convolution. The experimental results on simulated and real-resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Standard language model evaluations can fail to capture risks that emerge only at deployment scale. For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern neuroprostheses can now restore communication in patients who have lost the ability to speak or move. However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts.

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner has been shown to be more accurate than other medical devices in detecting mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity.</td>

However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Living biological tissue is a complex system, constantly growing and changing in response to external and internal stimuli. These processes lead to remarkable and intricate changes in shape. Modeling and understanding both natural and pathological (or abnormal) changes in the shape of anatomical structures is highly relevant, with applications in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic healthcare. Nevertheless, modeling the longitudinal shape change of biological tissue is a non-trivial task due to its inherent nonlinear nature. In this review, we highlight several existing methodologies and tools for modeling longitudinal shape change (i.e., spatiotemporal shape modeling). These methods range from diffeomorphic metric mapping to deep-learning based approaches (e.g., autoencoders, generative networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.). We discuss the synergistic combinations of existing technologies and potential directions for future research, underscoring key deficiencies in the current research landscape.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Our research is motivated by the urgent global issue of a large population affected by retinal diseases, which are evenly distributed but underserved by specialized medical expertise, particularly in non-urban areas. Our primary objective is to bridge this healthcare gap by developing a comprehensive diagnostic system capable of accurately predicting retinal diseases solely from fundus images. However, we faced significant challenges due to limited, diverse datasets and imbalanced class distributions. To overcome these issues, we have devised innovative strategies. Our research introduces novel approaches, utilizing hybrid models combining deeper Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformer encoders, and ensemble architectures sequentially and in parallel to classify retinal fundus images into 20 disease labels. Our overarching goal is to assess these advanced models' potential in practical applications, with a strong focus on enhancing retinal disease diagnosis accuracy across a broader spectrum of conditions. Importantly, our efforts have surpassed baseline model results, with the C-Tran ensemble model emerging as the leader, achieving a remarkable model score of 0.9166, surpassing the baseline score of 0.9. Additionally, experiments with the IEViT model showcased equally promising outcomes with improved computational efficiency. We've also demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic patch extraction and the integration of domain knowledge in computer vision tasks. In summary, our research strives to contribute significantly to retinal disease diagnosis, addressing the critical need for accessible healthcare solutions in underserved regions while aiming for comprehensive and accurate disease prediction.</td>

Both the mean DOCT value analysis and subjective grading showed statistically significant improvement of the DOCT image quality. In addition, a previously unobserved high DOCT layer was identified though image observation, which may represent the stratum basale with high keratinocyte proliferation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Metal artifacts in CT slices have long posed challenges in medical diagnostics. These artifacts degrade image quality, resulting in suboptimal visualization and complicating the accurate interpretation of tissues adjacent to metal implants. To address these issues, we introduce the Latent Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) Alignment Framework, which effectively reduces metal artifacts while avoiding the introduction of noise information. Our work is based on a key finding that even artifact-affected ordinary CT sequences contain sufficient information to discern detailed structures. The challenge lies in the inability to clearly represent this information. To address this issue, we developed an Alignment Framework that adjusts the representation of ordinary CT images to match GSI CT sequences. GSI is an advanced imaging technique using multiple energy levels to mitigate artifacts caused by metal implants. By aligning the representation to GSI data, we can effectively suppress metal artifacts while clearly revealing detailed structure, without introducing extraneous information into CT sequences. To facilitate the application, we propose a new dataset, Artifacts-GSI, captured from real patients with metal implants, and establish a new benchmark based on this dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces metal artifacts and greatly enhances the readability of CT slices.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of pathologic images and genomic data for survival analysis has gained increasing attention with advances in multimodal learning. However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Based on a 3D pre-treatment magnetic resonance (MR) scan, we developed DREME-MR to jointly reconstruct the reference patient anatomy and a data-driven, patient-specific cardiorespiratory motion model. Via a motion encoder simultaneously learned during the reconstruction, DREME-MR further enables real-time volumetric MR imaging and cardiorespiratory motion tracking with minimal intra treatment k-space data. From a 3D radial-spoke-based pre-treatment MR scan, DREME-MR uses spatiotemporal implicit-neural-representation (INR) to reconstruct pre-treatment dynamic volumetric MR images (learning task 1). The INR-based reconstruction takes a joint image reconstruction and deformable registration approach, yielding a reference anatomy and a corresponding cardiorespiratory motion model. The motion model adopts a low-rank, multi-resolution representation to decompose motion fields as products of motion coefficients and motion basis components (MBCs). Via a progressive, frequency-guided strategy, DREME-MR decouples cardiac MBCs from respiratory MBCs to resolve the two distinct motion modes. Simultaneously with the pre-treatment dynamic MRI reconstruction, DREME-MR also trains an INR-based motion encoder to infer cardiorespiratory motion coefficients directly from the raw k-space data (learning task 2), allowing real-time, intra-treatment volumetric MR imaging and motion tracking with minimal k-space data (20-30 spokes) acquired after the pre-treatment MRI scan. Evaluated using data from a digital phantom (XCAT) and a human scan, DREME-MR solves real-time 3D cardiorespiratory motion with a latency of < 165 ms (= 150-ms data acquisition + 15-ms inference time), fulfilling the temporal constraint of real-time imaging.</td>

This leads to synthetic images that may appear realistic numerically but lack clinical authenticity, posing significant challenges in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of AI-driven medical tools. To address this gap, we introduce GazeVal, a practical framework that synergizes expert eye-tracking data with direct radiological evaluations to assess the quality of synthetic medical images. GazeVal leverages gaze patterns of radiologists as they provide a deeper understanding of how experts perceive and interact with synthetic data in different tasks (i.e., diagnostic or Turing tests). Experiments with sixteen radiologists revealed that 96.6% of the generated images (by the most recent state-of-the-art AI algorithm) were identified as fake, demonstrating the limitations of generative AI in producing clinically accurate images.</td>
