<td style='padding: 4px;'>Assessment of lesions and their longitudinal progression from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring multiple sclerosis (MS). Machine learning models have demonstrated a great potential for automated MS lesion segmentation. Training such models typically requires large-scale high-quality datasets that are consistently annotated. However, MS imaging datasets are often small, segregated across multiple sites, with different formats (cross-sectional or longitudinal), and diverse annotation styles. This poses a significant challenge to train a unified MS lesion segmentation model. To tackle this challenge, we present SegHeD, a novel multi-dataset multi-task segmentation model that can incorporate heterogeneous data as input and perform all-lesion, new-lesion, as well as vanishing-lesion segmentation. Furthermore, we account for domain knowledge about MS lesions, incorporating longitudinal, spatial, and volumetric constraints into the segmentation model. SegHeD is assessed on five MS datasets and achieves a high performance in all, new, and vanishing-lesion segmentation, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in this field.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research into the external behaviors and internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks in the physical world. Studies suggest that powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, are beginning to exhibit human-like cognitive abilities, including planning, reasoning, and reflection. In this paper, we introduce a research line and methodology called LLM Psychology, leveraging human psychology experiments to investigate the cognitive behaviors and mechanisms of LLMs. We migrate the Typoglycemia phenomenon from psychology to explore the "mind" of LLMs. Unlike human brains, which rely on context and word patterns to comprehend scrambled text, LLMs use distinct encoding and decoding processes. Through Typoglycemia experiments at the character, word, and sentence levels, we observe: (I) LLMs demonstrate human-like behaviors on a macro scale, such as lower task accuracy and higher token/time consumption; (II) LLMs exhibit varying robustness to scrambled input, making Typoglycemia a benchmark for model evaluation without new datasets; (III) Different task types have varying impacts, with complex logical tasks (e.g., math) being more challenging in scrambled form; (IV) Each LLM has a unique and consistent "cognitive pattern" across tasks, revealing general mechanisms in its psychology process. We provide an in-depth analysis of hidden layers to explain these phenomena, paving the way for future research in LLM Psychology and deeper interpretability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix of tabular data and achieve success in a variety of applications. However, the empirical covariance matrix on which the VNNs operate may contain many spurious correlations, making VNNs' performance inconsistent due to these noisy estimates and decreasing their computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix before convolution. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve covariance estimation and reduce computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. We show that S-VNNs are more stable than nominal VNNs as well as sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we provide novel connections between S-VNN stability and data distribution. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on various application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, stability, and computational efficiency of S-VNNs compared with nominal VNNs.</td>

An exponential model is integrated into the standard BSO algorithm to enhance rule derivation, tailored specifically for diabetes-related data. The innovative fuzzy system is then applied to classification tasks involving diabetic datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in classification accuracy, as evidenced by our experiments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Numerical simulations rely on constructing accurate and detailed models to produce reliable results - a task that is often challenging. This task becomes notably more difficult when the model is of the human brain, the most complex organ of the human body. We create an anatomically comprehensive hexahedral mesh of the human brain using an open-source digital brain atlas from the Open Anatomy Project. This atlas currently includes over three hundred labelled anatomical structures of the brain and represents over two decades of development. It is a valuable tool currently used by medical professionals, medical students, and researchers for gathering, presenting, and discovering knowledge about the human brain. We demonstrate that this atlas can be used to efficiently create a detailed hexahedral finite element mesh of the brain for scientific computing. The two-way correspondence between the mesh and the atlas facilitates the construction of computational models and the communication and analysis of results. We present two case studies. The first case study constructs a biomechanical model of the brain to compute brain deformations and predict traumatic brain injury risk due to violent impact. In the second case study, we construct a bioelectric model of the brain to solve the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem, a frequent simulation process used in electrophysiology to study electromagnetic fields generated by the nervous system. These techniques are often used to help understand the behavior and functionality of the brain or for treating neurological disorders such as epilepsy. We demonstrate efficient and accurate model construction using the meshed anatomical brain atlas, as well as emphasize the importance of effective communication and contextual analysis of results for enabling multi-disciplinary scientific computing research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in control theory yield closed-loop neurostimulations for suppressing epileptiform seizures. These advances are illustrated by computer experiments which are easy to implement and to tune. The feedback synthesis is provided by an intelligent proportional-derivative (iPD) regulator associated to model-free control. This approach has already been successfully exploited in many concrete situations in engineering, since no precise computational modeling is needed. iPDs permit tracking a large variety of signals including high-amplitude epileptic activity. Those unpredictable pathological brain oscillations should be detected in order to avoid continuous stimulation, which might induce detrimental side effects. This is achieved by introducing a data mining method based on the maxima of the recorded signals. The real-time derivative estimation in a particularly noisy epileptiform environment is made possible due to a newly developed algebraic differentiator. The virtual patient is the Wendling model, i.e., a set of ordinary differential equations adapted from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model in order to generate epileptiform activity via appropriate values of excitation- and inhibition-related parameters. Several simulations, which lead to a large variety of possible scenarios, are discussed. They show the robustness of our control synthesis with respect to different virtual patients and external disturbances.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Studying structural brain networks has witnessed significant advancement in recent decades. Findings have revealed a geometric principle, the exponential distance rule (EDR) showing that the number of neurons decreases exponentially with the length of their axons. An EDR based network model explained various characteristics of inter-areal cortical networks in macaques, mice, and rats. The complete connectome of the Drosophila fruit fly has recently been mapped at the neuronal level. Our study demonstrates that the EDR holds true in Drosophila, and the EDR model effectively accounts for numerous binary and weighted properties of neuropil networks, also called projectome. Our study illustrates that the EDR model is a suitable null model for analyzing networks of brain regions, as it captures geometric and physical constraints in very different species. The importance of the null model lies in its ability to facilitate the identification of functionally significant features that are not caused by inevitable geometric constraints, as we illustrate with the pronounced asymmetry of connection weights important for functional hierarchy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of the mammalian brain exhibit a strikingly regular hexagonal firing field over space. These cells are learned after birth and are thought to support spatial navigation but also more abstract computations. Although various computational models, including those based on artificial neural networks, have been proposed to explain the formation of grid cells, the process through which the MEC circuit ${\it learns}$ to develop grid cells remains unclear. In this study, we argue that predictive coding, a biologically plausible plasticity rule known to learn visual representations, can also train neural networks to develop hexagonal grid representations from spatial inputs. We demonstrate that grid cells emerge robustly through predictive coding in both static and dynamic environments, and we develop an understanding of this grid cell learning capability by analytically comparing predictive coding with existing models. Our work therefore offers a novel and biologically plausible perspective on the learning mechanisms underlying grid cells. Moreover, it extends the predictive coding theory to the hippocampal formation, suggesting a unified learning algorithm for diverse cortical representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An exciting recent development for deep-tissue imaging with cellular resolution is three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) with excitation at long wavelengths (1300 and 1700 nm). In the last few years, long-wavelength 3PM has driven rapid progress in deep-tissue imaging beyond the depth limit of two-photon microscopy, with impacts in neuroscience, immunology, and cancer biology. However, wide adoption of 3PM faces challenges. Three-photon excitation (3PE) is naturally weaker than two-photon excitation, which places a premium on ultrashort pulses with high peak power. The inefficiency, complexity, and cost of current sources of these pulses present major barriers to the use of 3PM in typical biomedical research labs. Here, we describe a fiber-based source of femtosecond pulses with multi-megawatt peak power, tunable from 850 nm to 1700 nm. Compressed pulses from a fiber amplifier at 1030~nm are launched into an antiresonant hollow-core fiber filled with argon. By varying only the gas pressure, pulses with hundreds of nanojoules of energy and sub-100 fs duration are obtained at wavelengths between 850 and 1700 nm. This approach is a new route to an efficient, robust, and potentially low-cost source for multiphoton deep-tissue imaging. In particular, 960-nJ and 50-fs pulses are generated at 1300 nm with a conversion efficiency of 10\%. The nearly 20-MW peak power is an order of magnitude higher than the previous best from femtosecond fiber source at 1300~nm. As an example of the capabilities of the source, these pulses are used to image structure and neuronal activity in mouse brain as deep as 1.1 mm below the dura.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in medicine have confirmed that brain disorders often comprise multiple subtypes of mechanisms, developmental trajectories, or severity levels. Such heterogeneity is often associated with demographic aspects (e.g., sex) or disease-related contributors (e.g., genetics). Thus, the predictive power of machine learning models used for symptom prediction varies across subjects based on such factors. To model this heterogeneity, one can assign each training sample a factor-dependent weight, which modulates the subject's contribution to the overall objective loss function. To this end, we propose to model the subject weights as a linear combination of the eigenbases of a spectral population graph that captures the similarity of factors across subjects. In doing so, the learned weights smoothly vary across the graph, highlighting sub-cohorts with high and low predictability. Our proposed sample weighting scheme is evaluated on two tasks. First, we predict initiation of heavy alcohol drinking in young adulthood from imaging and neuropsychological measures from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Next, we detect Dementia vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using imaging and demographic measurements in subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared to existing sample weighting schemes, our sample weights improve interpretability and highlight sub-cohorts with distinct characteristics and varying model accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>NECOMIMI (NEural-COgnitive MultImodal EEG-Informed Image Generation with Diffusion Models) introduces a novel framework for generating images directly from EEG signals using advanced diffusion models. Unlike previous works that focused solely on EEG-image classification through contrastive learning, NECOMIMI extends this task to image generation. The proposed NERV EEG encoder demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple zero-shot classification tasks, including 2-way, 4-way, and 200-way, and achieves top results in our newly proposed Category-based Assessment Table (CAT) Score, which evaluates the quality of EEG-generated images based on semantic concepts. A key discovery of this work is that the model tends to generate abstract or generalized images, such as landscapes, rather than specific objects, highlighting the inherent challenges of translating noisy and low-resolution EEG data into detailed visual outputs. Additionally, we introduce the CAT Score as a new metric tailored for EEG-to-image evaluation and establish a benchmark on the ThingsEEG dataset. This study underscores the potential of EEG-to-image generation while revealing the complexities and challenges that remain in bridging neural activity with visual representation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mixed membership models are a flexible class of probabilistic data representations used for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, allowing each observation to partially belong to multiple clusters or features. In this manuscript, we extend the framework of functional mixed membership models to allow for covariate-dependent adjustments. The proposed model utilizes a multivariate Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition, which allows for a scalable and flexible model. Within this framework, we establish a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the identifiability of the mean, covariance, and allocation structure up to a permutation of the labels. This manuscript is primarily motivated by studies on functional brain imaging through electroencephalography (EEG) of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, we are interested in characterizing the heterogeneity of alpha oscillations for typically developing (TD) children and children with ASD. Since alpha oscillations are known to change as children develop, we aim to characterize the heterogeneity of alpha oscillations conditionally on the age of the child. Using the proposed framework, we were able to gain novel information on the developmental trajectories of alpha oscillations for children with ASD and how the developmental trajectories differ between TD children and children with ASD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the fields of affective computing (AC) and brain-machine interface (BMI), the analysis of physiological and behavioral signals to discern individual emotional states has emerged as a critical research frontier. While deep learning-based approaches have made notable strides in EEG emotion recognition, particularly in feature extraction and pattern recognition, significant challenges persist in achieving end-to-end emotion computation, including real-time processing, individual adaptation, and seamless user interaction. This paper presents the EEG Emotion Copilot, a system leveraging a lightweight large language model (LLM) operating in a local setting. The system is designed to first recognize emotional states directly from EEG signals, subsequently generate personalized diagnostic and treatment suggestions, and finally support the automation of electronic medical records. The proposed solution emphasizes both the accuracy of emotion recognition and an enhanced user experience, facilitated by an intuitive interface for participant interaction. We further discuss the construction of the data framework, model pruning, training, and deployment strategies aimed at improving real-time performance and computational efficiency. Privacy concerns are also addressed, with a focus on ethical data collection, processing, and the protection of users' personal information. Through these efforts, we aim to advance the application of AC in the medical domain, offering innovative approaches to mental health diagnostics and treatment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has been widely used for medical diagnosis, health care, and device control, the safety of EEG BCI has long been neglected. In this paper, we propose Professor X, an invisible and robust "mind-controller" that can arbitrarily manipulate the outputs of EEG BCI through backdoor attack, to alert the EEG community of the potential hazard. However, existing EEG attacks mainly focus on single-target class attacks, and they either require engaging the training stage of the target BCI, or fail to maintain high stealthiness. Addressing these limitations, Professor X exploits a three-stage clean label poisoning attack: 1) selecting one trigger for each class; 2) learning optimal injecting EEG electrodes and frequencies strategy with reinforcement learning for each trigger; 3) generating poisoned samples by injecting the corresponding trigger's frequencies into poisoned data for each class by linearly interpolating the spectral amplitude of both data according to previously learned strategies. Experiments on datasets of three common EEG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Professor X, which also easily bypasses existing backdoor defenses.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a neuroimaging technique that records brain neural activity with high temporal resolution. Unlike other methods, EEG does not require prohibitively expensive equipment and can be easily set up using commercially available portable EEG caps, making it an ideal candidate for brain-computer interfaces. However, EEG signals are characterised by poor spatial resolution and high noise levels, complicating their decoding. In this study, we employ a contrastive learning framework to align encoded EEG features with pretrained CLIP features, achieving a 7% improvement over the state-of-the-art in EEG decoding of object categories. This enhancement is equally attributed to (1) a novel online sampling method that boosts the signal-to-noise ratio and (2) multimodal representations leveraging visual and language features to enhance the alignment space. Our analysis reveals a systematic interaction between the architecture and dataset of pretrained features and their alignment efficacy for EEG signal decoding. This interaction correlates with the generalisation power of the pretrained features on ImageNet-O/A datasets ($r=.5$). These findings extend beyond EEG signal alignment, offering potential for broader applications in neuroimaging decoding and generic feature alignments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper investigates sound and music interactions arising from the use of electromyography (EMG) to instrumentalise signals from muscle exertion of the human body. We situate EMG within a family of embodied interaction modalities, where it occupies a middle ground, considered as a ''signal from the inside'' compared with external observations of the body (e.g., motion capture), but also seen as more volitional than neurological states recorded by brain electroencephalogram (EEG). To understand the messiness of gestural interaction afforded by EMG, we revisit the phenomenological turn in HCI, reading Paul Dourish's work on the transparency of ''ready-to-hand'' technologies against the grain of recent posthumanist theories, which offer a performative interpretation of musical entanglements between bodies, signals, and representations. We take music performance as a use case, reporting on the opportunities and constraints posed by EMG in workshop-based studies of vocal, instrumental, and electronic practices. We observe that across our diverse range of musical subjects, they consistently challenged notions of EMG as a transparent tool that directly registered the state of the body, reporting instead that it took on ''present-at-hand'' qualities, defamiliarising the performer's own sense of themselves and reconfiguring their embodied practice.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present an update on the EAVI physiological interface, a wireless, microcontroller based hardware design for the acquisition of bioelectrical signals. The system has been updated to process electroencephalogram brain signals in addition to muscle electromyogram. The hardware/firmware system interfaces with host software carrying out feature extraction and signal processing. Recent advances in electronics have made physiological computing applications practical and feasible. However, there is a gap between high end biomedical equipment and consumer DIY solutions. The hardware design we present here bridges this gap, and combines a specialized biosignal acquisition chip mated with a general-purpose microcontroller. It is based on the Texas Instruments ADS129x family a single chip integrated solution for high quality biosignal amplification and digitization. It serves as analogue front end via programmable gain amplifiers to a 24bit delta-sigma analog-digital converter. The microcontroller is the STMicroelectronics STM32F427, a Cortex-M4 family microcontroller with floating point unit . In addition to EMG acquisition, the board includes a Kionix KX122 three-axis accelerometer. The TI and Kionix sensing chipts communicate with the ST microcontroller over an I2C digital serial bus. The board communicates with the host computer or rest of the music system wirelessly over Bluetooth LE 4.2 using an ST SPBTLE-1S transceiver. The board can also communicate over USB where it registers with the host as a class compliant audio and MIDI device. Audio and physiological signals are treated in the same signal processing chain using the OWL framework. The demo will show multichannel EMG, and single channel EEG. We call this hybridization ''ExG''. We will present documentation of the EAVI board used in the lab and on stage, in user studies with neuro-diverse musicians and trained instrumentalists, as well as in performance with the experimental all-female band, Chicks on Speed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the correlation between EEG features and cognitive tasks is crucial for elucidating brain function. Brain activity synchronizes during speaking and listening tasks. However, it is challenging to estimate task-dependent brain activity characteristics with methods with low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, such as EEG, rather than methods with high spatial resolution, like fMRI. This study introduces a novel approach to EEG feature estimation that utilizes the weights of deep learning models to explore this association. We demonstrate that attention maps generated from Vision Transformers and EEGNet effectively identify features that align with findings from prior studies. EEGNet emerged as the most accurate model regarding subject independence and the classification of Listening and Speaking tasks. The application of Mel-Spectrogram with ViTs enhances the resolution of temporal and frequency-related EEG characteristics. Our findings reveal that the characteristics discerned through attention maps vary significantly based on the input data, allowing for tailored feature extraction from EEG signals. By estimating features, our study reinforces known attributes and predicts new ones, potentially offering fresh perspectives in utilizing EEG for medical purposes, such as early disease detection. These techniques will make substantial contributions to cognitive neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The multimodal model has demonstrated promise in histopathology. However, most multimodal models are based on H\&E and genomics, adopting increasingly complex yet black-box designs. In our paper, we propose a novel interpretable multimodal framework named SHAP-CAT, which uses a Shapley-value-based dimension reduction technique for effective multimodal fusion. Starting with two paired modalities -- H\&E and IHC images, we employ virtual staining techniques to enhance limited input data by generating a new clinical-related modality. Lightweight bag-level representations are extracted from image modalities and a Shapley-value-based mechanism is used for dimension reduction. For each dimension of the bag-level representation, attribution values are calculated to indicate how changes in the specific dimensions of the input affect the model output. In this way, we select a few top important dimensions of bag-level representation for each image modality to late fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SHAP-CAT framework incorporating synthetic modalities significantly enhances model performance, yielding a 5\% increase in accuracy for the BCI, an 8\% increase for IHC4BC-ER, and an 11\% increase for the IHC4BC-PR dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has been widely used for medical diagnosis, health care, and device control, the safety of EEG BCI has long been neglected. In this paper, we propose Professor X, an invisible and robust "mind-controller" that can arbitrarily manipulate the outputs of EEG BCI through backdoor attack, to alert the EEG community of the potential hazard. However, existing EEG attacks mainly focus on single-target class attacks, and they either require engaging the training stage of the target BCI, or fail to maintain high stealthiness. Addressing these limitations, Professor X exploits a three-stage clean label poisoning attack: 1) selecting one trigger for each class; 2) learning optimal injecting EEG electrodes and frequencies strategy with reinforcement learning for each trigger; 3) generating poisoned samples by injecting the corresponding trigger's frequencies into poisoned data for each class by linearly interpolating the spectral amplitude of both data according to previously learned strategies. Experiments on datasets of three common EEG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Professor X, which also easily bypasses existing backdoor defenses.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has potential applications in various fields, but their development is hindered by limited data and significant cross-individual variability. Inspired by the principles of learning and memory in the human hippocampus, we propose a multi-task (MT) classification model, called AM-MTEEG, which combines learning-based impulsive neural representations with bidirectional associative memory (AM) for cross-individual BCI classification tasks. The model treats the EEG classification of each individual as an independent task and facilitates feature sharing across individuals. Our model consists of an impulsive neural population coupled with a convolutional encoder-decoder to extract shared features and a bidirectional associative memory matrix to map features to class. Experimental results in two BCI competition datasets show that our model improves average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and reduces performance variance across individuals, and the waveforms reconstructed by the bidirectional associative memory provide interpretability for the model's classification results. The neuronal firing patterns in our model are highly coordinated, similarly to the neural coding of hippocampal neurons, indicating that our model has biological similarities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Designs for implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have increased significantly in recent years. Each device promises better clinical outcomes and quality-of-life improvements, yet due to severe and inflexible safety constraints, progress requires tight co-design from materials to circuits and all the way up the stack to applications and algorithms. This trend has become more aggressive over time, forcing clinicians and patients to rely on vendor-specific hardware and software for deployment, maintenance, upgrades, and replacement. This over-reliance is ethically problematic, especially if companies go out-of-business or business objectives diverge from clinical promises. Device heterogeneity additionally burdens clinicians and healthcare facilities, adding complexity and costs for in-clinic visits, monitoring, and continuous access.   Reliability, interoperability, portability, and future-proofed design is needed, but this unfortunately comes at a cost. These system features sap resources that would have otherwise been allocated to reduce power/energy and improve performance. Navigating this trade-off in a systematic way is critical to providing patients with forever access to their implants and reducing burdens placed on healthcare providers and caretakers. We study the integration of on-device storage to highlight the sensitivity of this trade-off and establish other points of interest within BCI design that require careful investigation. In the process, we revisit relevant problems in computer architecture and medical devices from the current era of hardware specialization and modern neurotechnology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To maintain a user's sense of agency (SoA) when working with a physical motor augmentation device, the actuation must align with the user's intentions. In experiments, this is often achieved using stimulus-response paradigms where the motor augmentation can be optimally timed. However, in the everyday world users primarily act at their own volition. We designed a closed-loop system for motor augmentation using an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to cue users' volitional finger tapping. Relying on the readiness potentials, the system autonomously cued the finger movement at the time of the intent to interact via electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The prototype discriminated pre-movement from idle EEG segments with an average F1 score of 0.7. However, we found only weak evidence for a maintained SoA. Still, participants reported a higher level of control when working with the system instead of being passively moved.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Advancements in non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology have enabled communication through brain activity, offering significant potential for individuals with motor impairments. Existing methods for decoding characters or words from EEG recordings either rely on continuous external stimulation for high decoding accuracy or depend on direct intention imagination, which suffers from reduced discrimination ability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals for emotion recognition is a significant advancement in understanding human emotions. However, due to the lack of artificial intelligence data and algorithms in this field, current research faces the following challenges: 1) The portable wearable devices have higher requirements for lightweight models; 2) The objective differences of physiology and psychology among different subjects aggravate the difficulty of emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-subject fNIRS emotion recognition method, called the Online Multi-level Contrastive Representation Distillation framework (OMCRD). Specifically, OMCRD is a framework designed for mutual learning among multiple lightweight student networks. It utilizes multi-level fNIRS feature extractor for each sub-network and conducts multi-view sentimental mining using physiological signals. The proposed Inter-Subject Interaction Contrastive Representation (IS-ICR) facilitates knowledge transfer for interactions between student models, enhancing cross-subject emotion recognition performance. The optimal student network can be selected and deployed on a wearable device. Some experimental results demonstrate that OMCRD achieves state-of-the-art results in emotional perception and affective imagery tasks.</td>

Accurate EEG source localization is crucial for applications in cognitive neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To make significant progress toward precise source orientation detection and improved signal reconstruction, we introduce the Accelerated Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (ALCMV) beamforming toolbox and the Accelerated Brain Source Orientation Detection (AORI) toolbox. The ALCMV algorithm speeds up EEG source reconstruction by utilizing recursive covariance matrix calculations, while AORI simplifies source orientation detection from three dimensions to one, reducing computational load by 66% compared to conventional methods. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we demonstrate that these algorithms maintain high accuracy, with orientation errors below 0.2% and signal reconstruction accuracy within 2%. These findings suggest that the proposed toolboxes represent a substantial advancement in the efficiency and speed of EEG source localization, making them well-suited for real-time neurotechnological applications.</td>

Until recent years, numerous models had been proposed, ranging from classical algorithms like Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. However, these models have shown limitations in areas such as generalizability, contextuality and scalability when it comes to effectively extracting the complex spatial-temporal information inherent in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To address these limitations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Mamba Network (STMambaNet), an innovative model leveraging the Mamba state space architecture, which excels in processing extended sequences with linear scalability. By incorporating spatial and temporal Mamba encoders, STMambaNet effectively captures the intricate dynamics in both space and time, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of EEG signals for MI classification. Experimental results on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate STMambaNet's superiority over existing models, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing MI-based BCIs and improving real-world BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions characterized by restricted interests and difficulties in communication. The complexity of ASD has resulted in a deficiency of objective diagnostic biomarkers. Deep learning methods have gained recognition for addressing these challenges in neuroimaging analysis, but finding and interpreting such diagnostic biomarkers are still challenging computationally. We propose an ASD feature reduction pipeline using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). We used Ncuts parcellations and Power atlas to extract functional connectivity data, resulting in over 30 thousand features. Then the pipeline further compresses the connectivities into 5 latent Gaussian distributions, providing is a low-dimensional representation of the data, using a denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE). To test the method, we employed the extracted latent features from the DVAE to classify ASD using traditional classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) on a large multi-site dataset. The 95% confidence interval for the prediction accuracy of the SVM is [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization using the extracted latent distributions. Without using DVAE, the prediction accuracy is 0.70, which falls within the interval. This implies that the model successfully encodes the diagnostic information in rs-fMRI data to 5 Gaussian distributions (10 features) without sacrificing prediction performance. The runtime for training the DVAE and obtaining classification results from its extracted latent features (37 minutes) was 7 times shorter compared to training classifiers directly on the raw connectivity matrices (5-6 hours). Our findings also suggest that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than Ncuts parcellations. The encoded features can be used for the help of diagnosis and interpretation of the disease.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-related research topics in artificial intelligence have recently gained popularity, particularly due to the expansion of what multimodal architectures can do from computer vision to natural language processing. Our main goal in this work is to explore the possibilities and limitations of these architectures in spoken text decoding from non-invasive fMRI recordings. Contrary to vision and textual data, fMRI data represent a complex modality due to the variety of brain scanners, which implies (i) the variety of the recorded signal formats, (ii) the low resolution and noise of the raw signals, and (iii) the scarcity of pretrained models that can be leveraged as foundation models for generative learning. These points make the problem of the non-invasive decoding of text from fMRI recordings very challenging. In this paper, we propose and end-to-end multimodal LLM for decoding spoken text from fMRI signals. The proposed architecture is founded on (i) an encoder derived from a specific transformer incorporating an augmented embedding layer for the encoder and a better-adjusted attention mechanism than that present in the state of the art, and (ii) a frozen large language model adapted to align the embedding of the input text and the encoded embedding of brain activity to decode the output text. A benchmark in performed on a corpus consisting of a set of interactions human-human and human-robot interactions where fMRI and conversational signals are recorded synchronously. The obtained results are very promising, as our proposal outperforms the evaluated models, and is able to generate text capturing more accurate semantics present in the ground truth.

This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: Brain Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the correlation between EEG features and cognitive tasks is crucial for elucidating brain function. Brain activity synchronizes during speaking and listening tasks. However, it is challenging to estimate task-dependent brain activity characteristics with methods with low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, such as EEG, rather than methods with high spatial resolution, like fMRI. This study introduces a novel approach to EEG feature estimation that utilizes the weights of deep learning models to explore this association. We demonstrate that attention maps generated from Vision Transformers and EEGNet effectively identify features that align with findings from prior studies. EEGNet emerged as the most accurate model regarding subject independence and the classification of Listening and Speaking tasks. The application of Mel-Spectrogram with ViTs enhances the resolution of temporal and frequency-related EEG characteristics. Our findings reveal that the characteristics discerned through attention maps vary significantly based on the input data, allowing for tailored feature extraction from EEG signals. By estimating features, our study reinforces known attributes and predicts new ones, potentially offering fresh perspectives in utilizing EEG for medical purposes, such as early disease detection. These techniques will make substantial contributions to cognitive neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we explore the decoding of mental imagery from subjects using their fMRI measurements. In order to achieve this decoding, we first created a mapping between a subject's fMRI signals elicited by the videos the subjects watched. This mapping associates the high dimensional fMRI activation states with visual imagery. Next, we prompted the subjects textually, primarily with emotion labels which had no direct reference to visual objects. Then to decode visual imagery that may have been in a person's mind's eye, we align a latent representation of these fMRI measurements with a corresponding video-fMRI based on textual labels given to the videos themselves. This alignment has the effect of overlapping the video fMRI embedding with the text-prompted fMRI embedding, thus allowing us to use our fMRI-to-video mapping to decode. Additionally, we enhance an existing fMRI dataset, initially consisting of data from five subjects, by including recordings from three more subjects gathered by our team. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on this augmented dataset both in accurately creating a mapping, as well as in plausibly decoding mental imagery.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promise in detecting functional abnormalities in various brain disorders. However, existing studies often focus on a single domain or modality, neglecting the valuable complementary information offered by multiple domains from both fMRI and EEG, which is crucial for a comprehensive representation of disorder pathology. This limitation poses a challenge in effectively leveraging the synergistic information derived from these modalities. To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Cross-domain Self-supervised Pre-training Model (MCSP), a novel approach that leverages self-supervised learning to synergize multi-modal information across spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Our model employs cross-domain self-supervised loss that bridges domain differences by implementing domain-specific data augmentation and contrastive loss, enhancing feature discrimination. Furthermore, MCSP introduces cross-modal self-supervised loss to capitalize on the complementary information of fMRI and EEG, facilitating knowledge distillation within domains and maximizing cross-modal feature convergence. We constructed a large-scale pre-training dataset and pretrained MCSP model by leveraging proposed self-supervised paradigms to fully harness multimodal neuroimaging data. Through comprehensive experiments, we have demonstrated the superior performance and generalizability of our model on multiple classification tasks. Our study contributes a significant advancement in the fusion of fMRI and EEG, marking a novel integration of cross-domain features, which enriches the existing landscape of neuroimaging research, particularly within the context of mental disorder studies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience employs diverse neuroimaging techniques, each offering distinct insights into brain activity, from electrophysiological recordings such as EEG, which have high temporal resolution, to hemodynamic modalities such as fMRI, which have increased spatial precision. However, integrating these heterogeneous data sources remains a challenge, which limits a comprehensive understanding of brain function. We present the Spatiotemporal Alignment of Multimodal Brain Activity (SAMBA) framework, which bridges the spatial and temporal resolution gaps across modalities by learning a unified latent space free of modality-specific biases. SAMBA introduces a novel attention-based wavelet decomposition for spectral filtering of electrophysiological recordings, graph attention networks to model functional connectivity between functional brain units, and recurrent layers to capture temporal autocorrelations in brain signal. We show that the training of SAMBA, aside from achieving translation, also learns a rich representation of brain information processing. We showcase this classify external stimuli driving brain activity from the representation learned in hidden layers of SAMBA, paving the way for broad downstream applications in neuroscience research and clinical contexts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the morphology of galaxies is a critical aspect of astrophysics research, providing insight into the formation, evolution, and physical properties of these vast cosmic structures. Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\sim200$ for 2D images and $\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Abnormality detection in the identification of a single-subject which deviates from the majority of the dataset that comes from a control group is a critical problem. A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mobile edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence~(GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</td>

The calibration of an energy scale of the calorimeter with several calibration sources is also discussed to achieve a high resolution of 1.8 %.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>LLMs are ideal for decision-making due to their ability to reason over long contexts and identify critical factors. However, challenges arise when processing transcripts of spoken speech describing complex scenarios. These transcripts often contain ungrammatical or incomplete sentences, repetitions, hedging, and vagueness. For example, during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite significant uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce DeFine, a new framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. DeFine then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in novel situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty in complex scenarios and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in fields such as medical consultations, negotiations, and political debates, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), considered the gold standard for noninvasive cardiac assessment, is a diverse and complex modality requiring a wide variety of image processing tasks for comprehensive assessment of cardiac morphology and function. Advances in deep learning have enabled the development of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models for these tasks. However, model training is challenging due to data and label scarcity, especially in the less common imaging sequences. Moreover, each model is often trained for a specific task, with no connection between related tasks. In this work, we introduce a vision foundation model trained for CMR assessment, that is trained in a self-supervised fashion on 36 million CMR images. We then finetune the model in supervised way for 9 clinical tasks typical to a CMR workflow, across classification, segmentation, landmark localization, and pathology detection. We demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness across all tasks, over a range of available labeled dataset sizes. We also demonstrate improved few-shot learning with fewer labeled samples, a common challenge in medical image analyses. We achieve an out-of-box performance comparable to SoTA for most clinical tasks. The proposed method thus presents a resource-efficient, unified framework for CMR assessment, with the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning-based solutions for image analysis tasks, even with few annotated data available.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: One of the key FDA-approved medications for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is buprenorphine. Despite its popularity, individuals often report various information needs regarding buprenorphine treatment on social media platforms like Reddit. However, the key challenge is to characterize these needs. In this study, we propose a theme-based framework to curate and analyze large-scale data from social media to characterize self-reported treatment information needs (TINs).   Methods: We collected 15,253 posts from r/Suboxone, one of the largest Reddit sub-community for buprenorphine products. Following the standard protocol, we first identified and defined five main themes from the data and then coded 6,000 posts based on these themes, where one post can be labeled with applicable one to three themes. Finally, we determined the most frequently appearing sub-themes (topics) for each theme by analyzing samples from each group.   Results: Among the 6,000 posts, 40.3% contained a single theme, 36% two themes, and 13.9% three themes. The most frequent topics for each theme or theme combination came with several key findings - prevalent reporting of psychological and physical effects during recovery, complexities in accessing buprenorphine, and significant information gaps regarding medication administration, tapering, and usage of substances during different stages of recovery. Moreover, self-treatment strategies and peer-driven advice reveal valuable insights and potential misconceptions.   Conclusions: The findings obtained using our proposed framework can inform better patient education and patient-provider communication, design systematic interventions to address treatment-related misconceptions and rumors, and streamline the generation of hypotheses for future research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Line-by-line scanning with linear arrays is a standard image formation method in clinical ultrasound. This method examines progressively a given region of interest by conducting focused pulse-echo measurements with dynamic transmit and receive apertures. Such apertures widen with the focal length as a function of a given F-number and improve the image quality by extending the depth of field (DOF) and suppressing grating lobes. Fixed F-numbers, however, limit the lateral resolution. Herein, frequency dependence of the F-number is incorporated into both the transmit and the receive focusing to widen the apertures for low frequencies and improve the lateral resolution. Frequency-dependent transmit and receive F-numbers are proposed. These F-numbers, which can be expressed in closed form, maximize the lateral resolution under constraints on the DOF and the grating lobes. A phantom experiment showed that the proposed F-numbers eliminate grating lobe artifacts and improve both image uniformity and contrast to a similar extent as fixed F-numbers. These metrics, compared to the usage of the full apertures, improved by up to 14.1 % and 8.3 %, respectively. The proposed F-numbers, however, improved the lateral resolution by up to 24 % compared to the fixed F-numbers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-ideal measurement computed tomography (NICT), which sacrifices optimal imaging standards for new advantages in CT imaging, is expanding the clinical application scope of CT images. However, with the reduction of imaging standards, the image quality has also been reduced, extremely limiting the clinical acceptability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning for the NICT enhancement in specific scenarios, their high data cost and limited generalizability have become large obstacles. The recent research on the foundation model has brought new opportunities for building a universal NICT enhancement model - bridging the image quality degradation with minimal data cost. However, owing to the challenges in the collection of large pre-training datasets and the compatibility of data variation, no success has been reported. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. It has been pre-trained on a large-scale physical-driven simulation dataset with 3.6 million NICT-ICT image pairs, and is able to directly generalize to the NICT enhancement tasks with various non-ideal settings and body regions. Via the adaptation with few data, it can further achieve professional performance in real-world specific scenarios. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed TAMP has significant potential for promoting the exploration and application of NICT and serving a wider range of medical scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Random Forests are widely recognized for establishing efficacy in classification and regression tasks, standing out in various domains such as medical diagnosis, finance, and personalized recommendations. These domains, however, are inherently sensitive to privacy concerns, as personal and confidential data are involved. With increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, particularly under regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, the ability to perform machine unlearning has become crucial for Random Forests. However, insufficient attention was paid to this topic, and existing approaches face difficulties in being applied to real-world scenarios. Addressing this gap, we propose the DynFrs framework designed to enable efficient machine unlearning in Random Forests while preserving predictive accuracy. Dynfrs leverages subsampling method Occ(q) and a lazy tag strategy Lzy, and is still adaptable to any Random Forest variant. In essence, Occ(q) ensures that each sample in the training set occurs only in a proportion of trees so that the impact of deleting samples is limited, and Lzy delays the reconstruction of a tree node until necessary, thereby avoiding unnecessary modifications on tree structures. In experiments, applying Dynfrs on Extremely Randomized Trees yields substantial improvements, achieving orders of magnitude faster unlearning performance and better predictive accuracy than existing machine unlearning methods for Random Forests.</td>

SUMMIT delivers co-registered T1, T2, T2*, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Extensive simulations and phantom imaging demonstrate SUMMIT's high accuracy.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising paradigm to handle the domain shifts at test time for medical images from different institutions without using extra training data. However, existing TTA solutions for segmentation tasks suffer from (1) dependency on modifying the source training stage and access to source priors or (2) lack of emphasis on shape-related semantic knowledge that is crucial for segmentation tasks.Recent research on visual prompt learning achieves source-relaxed adaptation by extended parameter space but still neglects the full utilization of semantic features, thus motivating our work on knowledge-enriched deep prompt learning. Beyond the general concern of image style shifts, we reveal that shape variability is another crucial factor causing the performance drop. To address this issue, we propose a TTA framework called PASS (Prompting to Adapt Styles and Semantic shapes), which jointly learns two types of prompts: the input-space prompt to reformulate the style of the test image to fit into the pretrained model and the semantic-aware prompts to bridge high-level shape discrepancy across domains. Instead of naively imposing a fixed prompt, we introduce an input decorator to generate the self-regulating visual prompt conditioned on the input data. To retrieve the knowledge representations and customize target-specific shape prompts for each test sample, we propose a cross-attention prompt modulator, which performs interaction between target representations and an enriched shape prompt bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PASS over state-of-the-art methods on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.

Our contributions include developing MedQA-CS, a comprehensive evaluation framework with publicly available data and expert annotations, and providing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of LLMs as reliable judges in CS evaluation. Our experiments show that MedQA-CS is a more challenging benchmark for evaluating clinical skills than traditional multiple-choice QA benchmarks (e.g., MedQA). Combined with existing benchmarks, MedQA-CS enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' clinical capabilities for both open- and closed-source LLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Inhomogeneity of the transmitted radiofrequency field B1+ is a major factor hindering the image quality in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at high field strengths. Here, a novel approach is presented, to locally modulate the B1+ utilizing an array of high permittivity materials with switchable connections. A 3$\times$3 array of barium titanate suspension elements was constructed, with two PIN diode-based switchable connectors per element. Electromagnetic simulations were performed to determine configurations that produce strong B1+ modulation. Remote B1+ field switching was tested in a disk- and and a torso-shaped phantom at 3T by applying different bias voltages to the PIN diodes. The attained B1+ modulation was assessed at various switching pattern positions and various depths within the phantoms. The configuration with the strongest effect size has produced up to 11% modulation in simulations at 15 mm depth, with excellent translation properties. The effects were successfully replicated in phantoms, with a 5 V bias voltage producing up to 11.6$\pm$0.2% modulation. At the relative depth of the human heart, up to 6% of modulation was observed in the torso phantom. The presented method may provide a promising direction for cost-effective, and adaptive B1+ shimming without changes to the scanner hardware.</td>
