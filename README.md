<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern microscopy routinely produces gigapixel images that contain structures across multiple spatial scales, from fine cellular morphology to broader tissue organization. Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks. These results demonstrate that explicit world-coordinate modelling provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging multi-resolution information in large-scale microscopy analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise volumetric delineation of hippocampal structures is essential for quantifying neurodevelopmental trajectories in pre-term and term infants, where subtle morphological variations may carry prognostic significance. While foundation encoders trained on large-scale visual data offer discriminative representations, their 2D formulation is a limitation with respect to the $3$D organization of brain anatomy. We propose a volumetric segmentation strategy that reconciles this tension through a structured window-based disassembly-reassembly mechanism: the global MRI volume is decomposed into non-overlapping 3D windows or sub-cubes, each processed via a separate decoding arm built upon frozen high-fidelity features, and subsequently reassembled prior to a ground-truth correspendence using a dense-prediction head. This architecture preserves constant a decoder memory footprint while forcing predictions to lie within an anatomically consistent geometry. Evaluated on the ALBERT dataset for hippocampal segmentation, the proposed approach achieves a Dice score of 0.65 for a single 3D window. The method demonstrates that volumetric anatomical structure could be recovered from frozen 2D foundation representations through structured compositional decoding, and offers a principled and generalizable extension for foundation models for 3D medical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale 3D medical imaging data face challenges when adapted to multiple downstream tasks under continual learning with limited labeled data. We address few-shot continual learning for 3D brain MRI by combining a frozen pretrained backbone with task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. Tasks arrive sequentially -- tumor segmentation (BraTS) and brain age estimation (IXI) -- with no replay of previous task data. Each task receives a dedicated LoRA adapter; only the adapter and task-specific head are trained while the backbone remains frozen, thereby eliminating catastrophic forgetting by design (BWT=0). In continual learning, sequential full fine-tuning suffers severe forgetting (T1 Dice drops from 0.80 to 0.16 after T2), while sequential linear probing achieves strong T1 (Dice 0.79) but fails on T2 (MAE 1.45). Our LoRA approach achieves the best balanced performance across both tasks: T1 Dice 0.62$\pm$0.07, T2 MAE 0.16$\pm$0.05, with zero forgetting and $<$0.1\% trainable parameters per task, though with noted systematic age underestimation in T2 (Wilcoxon $p<0.001$). Frozen foundation models with task-specific LoRA adapters thus offer a practical solution when both tasks must be maintained under few-shot continual learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simulation code for conventional supercomputers serves as a reference for neuromorphic computing systems. The present bottleneck of distributed large-scale spiking neuronal network simulations is the communication between compute nodes. Communication speed seems limited by the interconnect between the nodes and the software library orchestrating the data transfer. Profiling reveals, however, that the variability of the time required by the compute nodes between communication calls is large. The bottleneck is in fact the waiting time for the slowest node. A statistical model explains total simulation time on the basis of the distribution of computation times between communication calls. A fundamental cure is to avoid communication calls because this requires fewer synchronizations and reduces the variability of computation times across compute nodes. The organization of the mammalian brain into areas lends itself to such an optimization strategy. Connections between neurons within an area have short delays, but the delays of the long-range connections across areas are an order of magnitude longer. This suggests a structure-aware mapping of areas to compute nodes allowing for a partition into more frequent communication between nodes simulating a particular area and less frequent global communication. We demonstrate a substantial performance gain on a real-world example. This work proposes a local-global hybrid communication architecture for large-scale neuronal network simulations as a first step in mapping the structure of the brain to the structure of a supercomputer. It challenges the long-standing belief that the bottleneck of simulation is synchronization inherent in the collective calls of standard communication libraries. We provide guidelines for the energy efficient simulation of neuronal networks on conventional computing systems and raise the bar for neuromorphic systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models increasingly offer potential to support interactive, agentic workflows that assist researchers during analysis and interpretation of image data. Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate brain tumor diagnosis requires models to not only detect lesions but also generate clinically interpretable reasoning grounded in imaging manifestations, yet existing public datasets remain limited in annotation richness and diagnostic semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The automated detection of sexism in memes is a challenging task due to multimodal ambiguity, cultural nuance, and the use of humor to provide plausible deniability. Content-only models often fail to capture the complexity of human perception. To address this limitation, we introduce and validate a human-centered paradigm that augments standard content features with physiological data. We created a novel resource by recording Eye-Tracking (ET), Heart Rate (HR), and Electroencephalography (EEG) from 16 subjects (8 per experiment) while they viewed 3984 memes from the EXIST 2025 dataset. Our statistical analysis reveals significant physiological differences in how subjects process sexist versus non-sexist content. Sexist memes were associated with higher cognitive load, reflected in increased fixation counts and longer reaction times, as well as differences in EEG spectral power across the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands, suggesting more demanding neural processing.   Building on these findings, we propose a multimodal fusion model that integrates physiological signals with enriched textual-visual features derived from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Our final model achieves an AUC of 0.794 in binary sexism detection, a statistically significant 3.4% improvement over a strong VLM-based baseline. The fusion is particularly effective for nuanced cases, boosting the F1-score for the most challenging fine-grained category, Misogyny and Non-Sexual Violence, by 26.3%. These results show that physiological responses provide an objective signal of perception that enhances the accuracy and human-awareness of automated systems for countering online sexism.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We derive a scaling law relating ADC bit depth to effective bandwidth for signals with $1/f^α$ power spectra. Quantization introduces a flat noise floor whose intersection with the declining signal spectrum defines an effective cutoff frequency $f_c$. We show that each additional bit extends this cutoff by a factor of $2^{2/α}$, approximately doubling bandwidth per bit for $α= 2$. The law requires that quantization noise be approximately white, a condition whose minimum bit depth $N_{\min}$ we show to be $α$-dependent. Validation on synthetic $1/f^α$ signals for $α\in \{1.5, 2.0, 2.5\}$ yields prediction errors below 3\% using the theoretical noise floor $Δ^2/(6f_s)$, and approximately 14\% when the noise floor is estimated empirically from the quantized signal's spectrum.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We investigated the relationship among neural representations of vocalized, mimed, and imagined speech recorded using publicly available stereotactic EEG recordings. Most prior studies have focused on decoding speech responses within each condition separately. Here, instead, we explore how responses across conditions relate by training linear spectrogram reconstruction models for each condition and evaluate their generalization across conditions. We demonstrate that linear decoders trained on one condition generally transfer successfully to others, implying shared speech representations. This commonality was assessed with stimulus-level discriminability by performing a rank-based analysis demonstrating preservation of stimulus-specific structure in both within- and across-conditions. Finally, we compared linear reconstructions to those from a nonlinear neural network. While both exhibited cross-condition transfer, linear models achieve superior stimulus-level discriminability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a hands-free control modality for mobile robotics, yet decoding user intent during real-world navigation remains challenging. This work presents a brain-robot control framework for offline decoding of driving commands during robotic rover operation. A 4WD Rover Pro platform was remotely operated by 12 participants who navigated a predefined route using a joystick, executing the commands forward, reverse, left, right, and stop. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded with a 16-channel OpenBCI cap and aligned with motor actions at Delta = 0 ms and future prediction horizons (Delta > 0 ms). After preprocessing, several deep learning models were benchmarked, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer architectures. ShallowConvNet achieved the highest performance for both action prediction and intent prediction. By combining real-world robotic control with multi-horizon EEG intention decoding, this study introduces a reproducible benchmark and reveals key design insights for predictive deep learning-based BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>$\textit{Objective.}$ Accurate neural decoding of locomotion holds promise for advancing rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and understanding neural correlates of action. Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of locomotion kinematics across species on motorized treadmills. However, efforts to decode locomotion speed in more natural contexts$-$where pace is self-selected rather than externally imposed$-$are scarce, generally achieve only modest accuracy, and require intracranial implants. Here, we aim to decode self-paced locomotion speed non-invasively and continuously using cortex-wide EEG recordings from rats. $\textit{Approach.}$ We introduce an asynchronous brain$-$computer interface (BCI) that processes a stream of 32-electrode skull-surface EEG (0.01$-$45 Hz) to decode instantaneous speed from a non-motorized treadmill during self-paced locomotion in head-fixed rats. Using recurrent neural networks and a dataset of over 133 h of recordings, we trained decoders to map ongoing EEG activity to treadmill speed. $\textit{Main results.}$ Our decoding achieves a correlation of 0.88 ($R^2$ = 0.78) for speed, primarily driven by visual cortex electrodes and low-frequency ($< 8$ Hz) oscillations. Moreover, pre-training on a single session permitted decoding on other sessions from the same rat, suggesting uniform neural signatures that generalize across sessions but fail to transfer across animals. Finally, we found that cortical states not only carry information about current speed, but also about future and past dynamics, extending up to 1000 ms. $\textit{Significance.}$ These findings demonstrate that self-paced locomotion speed can be decoded accurately and continuously from non-invasive, cortex-wide EEG. Our approach provides a framework for developing high-performing, non-invasive BCI systems and contributes to understanding distributed neural representations of action dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It is a critical task to evalaute HER2 expression level accurately for breast cancer evaluation and targeted treatment therapy selection. However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks. Extensive experiments on the public BCI dataset demonstrate that LGD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods while enabling efficient inference using single-modality H&E inputs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based P300 brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable communication without physical movement by detecting stimulus-evoked neural responses. Accurate and efficient decoding remains challenging due to high dimensionality, temporal dependence, and complex interactions across EEG channels. Most existing approaches treat channels independently or rely on black-box machine learning models, limiting interpretability and personalization. We propose a sparse Bayesian time-varying regression framework that explicitly models pairwise EEG channel interactions while performing automatic temporal feature selection. The model employs a relaxed-thresholded Gaussian process prior to induce structured sparsity in both channel-specific and interaction effects, enabling interpretable identification of task-relevant channels and channel pairs. Applied to a publicly available P300 speller dataset of 55 participants, the proposed method achieves a median character-level accuracy of 100\% using all stimulus sequences and attains the highest overall decoding performance among competing statistical and deep learning approaches. Incorporating channel interactions yields subgroup-specific gains of up to 7\% in character-level accuracy, particularly among participants who abstained from alcohol (up to 18\% improvement). Importantly, the proposed method improves median BCI-Utility by approximately 10\% at its optimal operating point, achieving peak throughput after only seven stimulus sequences. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling structured EEG channel interactions within a principled Bayesian framework enhances predictive accuracy, improves user-centric throughput, and supports personalization in P300 BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</td>

To address this gap, we constructed MIND, a public motor imagery fNIRS-EEG dataset based on a four-class directional MI paradigm of the right upper limb. The dataset includes 64-channel EEG recordings (1000 Hz) and 51-channel fNIRS recordings (47.62 Hz) from 30 participants (12 females, 18 males; aged 19.0-25.0 years). We analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG spectral power and hemodynamic responses, and validate the potential advantages of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCIs in terms of classification accuracy. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the evaluation and comparison of neuroimaging analysis and decoding methods.</td>

To address this limitation, we propose Brain-OF, the first omnifunctional brain foundation model jointly pretrained on fMRI, EEG and MEG, capable of handling both unimodal and multimodal inputs within a unified framework. To reconcile heterogeneous spatiotemporal resolutions, we introduce the Any-Resolution Neural Signal Sampler, which projects diverse brain signals into a shared semantic space.To further manage semantic shifts, the Brain-OF backbone integrates DINT attention with a Sparse Mixture of Experts, where shared experts capture modality-invariant representations and routed experts specialize in modality-specific semantics. Furthermore, we propose Masked Temporal-Frequency Modeling, a dual-domain pretraining objective that jointly reconstructs brain signals in both the time and frequency domains. Brain-OF is pretrained on a large-scale corpus comprising around 40 datasets and demonstrates superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting the benefits of joint multimodal integration and dual-domain pretraining.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering brain function through non-invasive recordings requires synthesizing complementary high-frequency electromagnetic (EEG/MEG) and low-frequency metabolic (fMRI) signals. However, despite their shared neural origins, extreme discrepancies have traditionally confined these modalities to isolated analysis pipelines, hindering a holistic interpretation of brain activity. To bridge this fragmentation, we introduce \textbf{NOBEL}, a \textbf{n}euro-\textbf{o}mni-modal \textbf{b}rain-\textbf{e}ncoding \textbf{l}arge language model (LLM) that unifies these heterogeneous signals within the LLM's semantic embedding space. Our architecture integrates a unified encoder for EEG and MEG with a novel dual-path strategy for fMRI, aligning non-invasive brain signals and external sensory stimuli into a shared token space, then leverages an LLM as a universal backbone. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NOBEL serves as a robust generalist across standard single-modal tasks. We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses. NOBEL thus takes a step towards unifying non-invasive brain decoding, demonstrating the promising potential of omni-modal brain understanding.</td>

To address these challenges, we introduce PIME, an interpretable framework that bridges intrinsic interpretability with minimal-sufficient subgraph optimization by integrating prototype-based classification and consistency training with structural perturbations during learning. This encourages a structured latent space and enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) under a prototype-consistent objective to extract compact minimal-sufficient explanatory subgraphs post-training. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that PIME achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by constraining the search space via learned prototypes, PIME identifies critical brain regions that are consistent with established neuroimaging findings. Stability analysis shows 90% reproducibility and consistent explanations across atlases.</td>

We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions. VCDF provides an effective reliability layer for time series causal discovery without altering underlying modeling assumptions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Representational similarity metrics typically force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations. We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The white matter of the brain is organised into axonal bundles that support long-range neural communication. Although diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables detailed mapping of these pathways through tractography, how white matter pathways directly facilitate large-scale neural synchronisation remains poorly understood. We developed a data-driven framework that integrates dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) to model the dynamic coupling supported by white matter tracks. Specifically, we employed track dynamic functional connectivity (Track-DFC) to characterise functional coupling of remote grey matter connected by individual white matter tracks. Using independent component analysis followed by k-medoids clustering, we derived functionally-coherent clusters of white matter tracks from the Human Connectome Project young adult cohort. When applied to the HCP ageing cohort, these clusters exhibited widespread age-related declines in both functional coupling strength and temporal variability. Importantly, specific clusters encompassing pathways linking control, default mode, attention, and visual systems significantly mediated the relationship between age and cognitive performance. Together, these findings depict the functional organisation of white matter tracks and provide a powerful tool to study brain ageing and cognitive decline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the dynamic nature of brain connectivity is critical for elucidating neural processing, behavior, and brain disorders. Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic reasoning across multimodal domains. However, their integration with graph-based models of brain connectivity remains limited. In addition, most existing fMRI analysis methods rely on static Functional Connectivity (FC) representations, which obscure transient neural dynamics critical for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Recent state-space approaches, including Mamba, model temporal structure efficiently, but are typically used as standalone feature extractors without explicit high-level reasoning. We propose NeuroMambaLLM, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic latent graph learning and selective state-space temporal modelling with LLMs. The proposed method learns the functional connectivity dynamically from raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) time series, replacing fixed correlation graphs with adaptive latent connectivity while suppressing motion-related artifacts and capturing long-range temporal dependencies. The resulting dynamic brain representations are projected into the embedding space of an LLM model, where the base language model remains frozen and lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are trained for parameter-efficient alignment. This design enables the LLM to perform both diagnostic classification and language-based reasoning, allowing it to analyze dynamic fMRI patterns and generate clinically meaningful textual reports.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) can provide a more complete view of brain function by merging high temporal and spatial resolutions. High-field ($\geq$3T) systems are standard, and require technical trade-offs, including artifacts in the EEG signal, reduced compatibility with metallic implants, high acoustic noise, and artifacts around high-susceptibility areas such as the optic nerve and nasal sinus. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 0.55T in a visual task. We characterize the gradient and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts inherent to this environment and observe reduced BCG magnitude consistent with the expected scaling of pulse-related artifacts with static magnetic field strength. This reduction shows promise for facilitating effective denoising while preserving the alpha rhythm and signal integrity. Furthermore, we tested a multimodal integration pipeline and demonstrated that the EEG power envelope corresponds with the hemodynamic BOLD response, supporting the potential to measure neurovascular coupling in this environment. We demonstrate that combined EEG-fMRI at 0.55T is feasible and represents a promising environment for multimodal neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain foundation models have achieved remarkable advances across a wide range of neuroscience tasks. However, most existing models are limited to a single functional modality, restricting their ability to exploit complementary spatiotemporal dynamics and the collective data scale across imaging techniques. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-OF, the first omnifunctional brain foundation model jointly pretrained on fMRI, EEG and MEG, capable of handling both unimodal and multimodal inputs within a unified framework. To reconcile heterogeneous spatiotemporal resolutions, we introduce the Any-Resolution Neural Signal Sampler, which projects diverse brain signals into a shared semantic space.To further manage semantic shifts, the Brain-OF backbone integrates DINT attention with a Sparse Mixture of Experts, where shared experts capture modality-invariant representations and routed experts specialize in modality-specific semantics. Furthermore, we propose Masked Temporal-Frequency Modeling, a dual-domain pretraining objective that jointly reconstructs brain signals in both the time and frequency domains. Brain-OF is pretrained on a large-scale corpus comprising around 40 datasets and demonstrates superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting the benefits of joint multimodal integration and dual-domain pretraining.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering brain function through non-invasive recordings requires synthesizing complementary high-frequency electromagnetic (EEG/MEG) and low-frequency metabolic (fMRI) signals. However, despite their shared neural origins, extreme discrepancies have traditionally confined these modalities to isolated analysis pipelines, hindering a holistic interpretation of brain activity. To bridge this fragmentation, we introduce \textbf{NOBEL}, a \textbf{n}euro-\textbf{o}mni-modal \textbf{b}rain-\textbf{e}ncoding \textbf{l}arge language model (LLM) that unifies these heterogeneous signals within the LLM's semantic embedding space. Our architecture integrates a unified encoder for EEG and MEG with a novel dual-path strategy for fMRI, aligning non-invasive brain signals and external sensory stimuli into a shared token space, then leverages an LLM as a universal backbone. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NOBEL serves as a robust generalist across standard single-modal tasks. We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses. NOBEL thus takes a step towards unifying non-invasive brain decoding, demonstrating the promising potential of omni-modal brain understanding.</td>

Transfer learning yields consistent improvements, with in-task accuracy gains of 1-4% and larger cross-task gains of up to 5-6%. Not only does pre-training improve performance within each task, but it also enables reliable cross-task decoding between perception and production. Critically, models trained on speech production decode passive listening above chance, confirming that learned representations reflect shared neural processes rather than task-specific motor activity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent experimental observations, most notably those reported by the ATOMKI and Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment (PADME) collaborations, have hinted anomalies that may indicate the presence of a new resonance with a mass around $17\,\text{MeV}$, potentially interacting with both nucleons and electrons. Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$.   Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG~II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\,\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, with $\ell_α\ne\ell_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell_α\ell_β\big)\propto\big| η_{βα} \big|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.</td>

This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play important and complementary roles in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, compared to the low cost and portability of EEG, MEG is more expensive and less portable, which severely limits the practical application of MEG in BCI systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</td>

A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite advances in machine learning-based medical image classifiers, the safety and reliability of these systems remain major concerns in practical settings. Existing auditing approaches mainly rely on unimodal features or metadata-based subgroup analyses, which are limited in interpretability and often fail to capture hidden systematic failures. To address these limitations, we introduce the first automated auditing framework that extends slice discovery methods to multimodal representations specifically for medical applications. Comprehensive experiments were conducted under common failure scenarios using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset, demonstrating the framework's strong capability in both failure discovery and explanation generation. Our results also show that multimodal information generally allows more comprehensive and effective auditing of classifiers, while unimodal variants beyond image-only inputs exhibit strong potential in scenarios where resources are constrained.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Preterm birth is associated with premature cervical remodeling, yet current clinical assessments cannot detect the underlying microstructural changes in collagen organization. We apply imaging Mueller polarimetry to murine cervical tissue at three gestational stages (early, mid, late) and develop classification methods to predict gestational stage from polarimetric maps. Using Lu-Chipman decomposition, we extract orientation and azimuth local variability maps that capture collagen fiber alignment and disorder. We evaluate two approaches under 20-fold leave-one-out cross-validation: an analytical threshold classifier on mean azimuth local variability, and a lightweight CNN ensemble (approximately 76k parameters) operating on spatially resolved maps. The ensemble achieves 70..0% sample-level accuracy, outperforming the analytical baseline (55.0%), with strong performance on early (71.0%) and late (86.0%) gestation. Spatial prediction maps confirm that classification accuracy is highest in the stroma, where collagen remodeling is most prominent. These results demonstrate that Mueller polarimetry combined with deep learning models can detect gestational collagen remodeling noninvasively, offering a potential pathway toward objective cervical assessment for preterm birth risk.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It has been suggested that generative image models such as diffusion models can improve performance on clinically relevant tasks by offering deep learning models supplementary training data. However, most conditional diffusion models treat disease stages as independent classes, ignoring the continuous nature of disease progression. This mismatch is problematic in medical imaging because continuous pathological processes are typically only observed through coarse, discrete but ordered labels as in ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy (DR). We propose an ordinal latent diffusion model for generating color fundus images that explicitly incorporates the ordered structure of DR severity into the generation process. Instead of categorical conditioning, we used a scalar disease representation, enabling a smooth transition between adjacent stages. We evaluated our approach using visual realism metrics and classification-based clinical consistency analysis on the EyePACS dataset. Compared to a standard conditional diffusion model, our model reduced the Fréchet inception distance for four of the five DR stages and increased the quadratic weighted $κ$ from 0.79 to 0.87. Furthermore, interpolation experiments showed that the model captured a continuous spectrum of disease progression learned from ordered, coarse class labels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Learning-based signal processing systems increasingly support high-stakes medical decisions using heterogeneous biomedical signals, including medical images, physiological time series, and clinical records. Despite strong predictive performance, many models rely on statistical correlations that are unstable across acquisition settings, patient populations, and institutional practices, limiting robustness, interpretability, and clinical trust. We advocate a causal signal processing perspective in which biomedical signals are treated as effects of latent generative mechanisms rather than as isolated predictive inputs. Using clinical risk prediction as a motivating example, we show how disease-related factors generate observable biomarkers, while acquisition processes act as confounders influencing signal appearance. In clinical disease risk prediction from chest CT scans and patient risk factors, correlational models may fail under scanner changes, whereas causal abstractions remain invariant. Building on this view, we propose a unifying conceptual framework integrating causal modeling with learning-based signal processing and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Statistical models extract multimodal representations that are mapped to interpretable causal abstractions and combined with symbolic knowledge encoding clinical risk factors and guidelines. This structure enables clinically grounded explanations, counterfactual reasoning about hypothetical interventions, and improved robustness to distribution shifts arising from changes in acquisition conditions or screening policies. Rather than introducing a specific algorithm, this article presents schematic causal structures and a comparative analysis of correlation-based, causal, and neuro-symbolic approaches to guide the design of robust and interpretable medical decision-support systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise volumetric delineation of hippocampal structures is essential for quantifying neurodevelopmental trajectories in pre-term and term infants, where subtle morphological variations may carry prognostic significance. While foundation encoders trained on large-scale visual data offer discriminative representations, their 2D formulation is a limitation with respect to the $3$D organization of brain anatomy. We propose a volumetric segmentation strategy that reconciles this tension through a structured window-based disassembly-reassembly mechanism: the global MRI volume is decomposed into non-overlapping 3D windows or sub-cubes, each processed via a separate decoding arm built upon frozen high-fidelity features, and subsequently reassembled prior to a ground-truth correspendence using a dense-prediction head. This architecture preserves constant a decoder memory footprint while forcing predictions to lie within an anatomically consistent geometry. Evaluated on the ALBERT dataset for hippocampal segmentation, the proposed approach achieves a Dice score of 0.65 for a single 3D window. The method demonstrates that volumetric anatomical structure could be recovered from frozen 2D foundation representations through structured compositional decoding, and offers a principled and generalizable extension for foundation models for 3D medical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The advent of large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has produced a vast zoo of medical foundation models. However, selecting optimal medical foundation models for specific segmentation tasks remains a computational bottleneck. Existing Transferability Estimation (TE) metrics, primarily designed for classification, rely on global statistical assumptions and fail to capture the topological complexity essential for dense prediction. We propose a novel Topology-Driven Transferability Estimation framework that evaluates manifold tractability rather than statistical overlap. Our approach introduces three components: (1) Global Representation Topology Divergence (GRTD), utilizing Minimum Spanning Trees to quantify feature-label structural isomorphism; (2) Local Boundary-Aware Topological Consistency (LBTC), which assesses manifold separability specifically at critical anatomical boundaries; and (3) Task-Adaptive Fusion, which dynamically integrates global and local metrics based on the semantic cardinality of the target task. Validated on the large-scale OpenMind benchmark across diverse anatomical targets and SSL foundation models, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by around \textbf{31\%} relative improvement in the weighted Kendall, providing a robust, training-free proxy for efficient model selection without the cost of fine-tuning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automated identification of DICOM image series is essential for large-scale medical image analysis, quality control, protocol harmonization, and reliable downstream processing. However, DICOM series classification remains challenging due to heterogeneous slice content, variable series length, and entirely missing, incomplete or inconsistent DICOM metadata. We propose an end-to-end multimodal framework for DICOM series classification that jointly models image content and acquisition metadata while explicitly accounting for all these challenges. (i) Images and metadata are encoded with modality-aware modules and fused using a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism. (ii) Metadata is processed by a sparse, missingness-aware encoder based on learnable feature dictionaries and value-conditioned modulation. By design, the approach does not require any form of imputation. (iii) Variability in series length and image data dimensions is handled via a 2.5D visual encoder and attention operating on equidistantly sampled slices. We evaluate the proposed approach on the publicly available Duke Liver MRI dataset and a large multi-institutional in-house cohort, assessing both in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization. Across all evaluation settings, the proposed method consistently outperforms relevant image only, metadata-only and multimodal 2D/3D baselines. The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling metadata sparsity and cross-modal interactions improves robustness for DICOM series classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods typically require large-scale annotated datasets and suffer from severe performance degradation under domain shifts. In clinical practice, however, acquiring extensive annotations for every new scanner or protocol is unfeasible. To address this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a pre-trained Vision Foundation Model (DINOv3) adapted for volumetric vessel segmentation. We introduce a lightweight 3D Adapter for volumetric consistency, a multi-scale 3D Aggregator for hierarchical feature fusion, and Z-channel embedding to effectively bridge the gap between 2D pre-training and 3D medical modalities, enabling the model to capture continuous vascular structures from limited data. We validated our method on the TopCoW (in-domain) and Lausanne (out-of-distribution) datasets. In the extreme few-shot regime with 5 training samples, our method achieved a Dice score of 43.42%, marking a 30% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art nnU-Net (33.41%) and outperforming other Transformer-based baselines, such as SwinUNETR and UNETR, by up to 45%. Furthermore, in the out-of-distribution setting, our model demonstrated superior robustness, achieving a 50% relative improvement over nnU-Net (21.37% vs. 14.22%), which suffered from severe domain overfitting. Ablation studies confirmed that our 3D adaptation mechanism and multi-scale aggregation strategy are critical for vascular continuity and robustness. Our results suggest foundation models offer a viable cold-start solution, improving clinical reliability under data scarcity or domain shifts.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the success of deep learning in dermoscopy image analysis, its inherent black-box nature hinders clinical trust, motivating the use of prototypical networks for case-based visual transparency. However, inevitable selection bias in clinical data often drives these models toward shortcut learning, where environmental confounders are erroneously encoded as predictive prototypes, generating spurious visual evidence that misleads medical decision-making. To mitigate these confounding effects, we propose CausalProto, an Unsupervised Causal Prototypical Network that fundamentally purifies the visual evidence chain. Framed within a Structural Causal Model, we employ an Information Bottleneck-constrained encoder to enforce strict unsupervised orthogonal disentanglement between pathological features and environmental confounders. By mapping these decoupled representations into independent prototypical spaces, we leverage the learned spurious dictionary to perform backdoor adjustment via do-calculus, transforming complex causal interventions into efficient expectation pooling to marginalize environmental noise. Extensive experiments on multiple dermoscopy datasets demonstrate that CausalProto achieves superior diagnostic performance and consistently outperforms standard black box models, while simultaneously providing transparent and high purity visual interpretability without suffering from the traditional accuracy compromise.</td>
