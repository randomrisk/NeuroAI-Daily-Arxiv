<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.   Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.   Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.   Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity (except slow frontal activity).   Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity. Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits, which are specific to each of the disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Symmetry breaking is common in animal and human brains where the lack of asymmetry often perturbs behavioral and cognitive functions. In particular, the ubiquity of mirror-image confusion in young children, which often persists in dyslexia, is established. However, the very existence of these symmetric mirror-images and their perceptual or memory nature remain controversial. Here, using the noise-activated afterimage method, we demonstrate that a dyslexic with mirror-images is an ideal candidate for solving the mystery. Indeed, after a monocular fixation, the primary afterimages are perceived alone through this eye, while the mirror-images are also perceived alone, but exclusively through the other eye which has remained closed. We deduce that the callosal interhemispheric connections are necessarily projected on the dominance columns of layer 4 of the primary cortex, the only layer where segregation is strict, and are furthermore crossed. Our results show that perceived primary and mirror images are spatially and temporally resolved.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches. Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging repositories. Our code is available at https://github.com/nainye/RadiomicsRetrieval.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly through larger and deeper neural networks, yet fundamental questions remain about how to optimize network dynamics for performance and adaptability. This study shows that deep neural networks (DNNs), like biological brains, perform optimally when operating near a critical phase transition - poised between active and inactive dynamics. Drawing from physics and neuroscience, we demonstrate that criticality provides a unifying principle linking structure, dynamics, and function in DNNs. Analyzing more than 80 state-of-the-art models, we first report that improvements in accuracy over the past decade coincided with an implicit evolution toward more critical dynamics. Architectural and training innovations unknowingly guided networks toward this optimal regime. Second, building on these insights, we develop a training method that explicitly drives networks to criticality, improving robustness and performance. Third, we show that fundamental problems in AI, including loss of performance in deep continual learning, are caused by loss of criticality and that maintaining criticality rescues performance. This work introduces criticality as a fundamental framework for AI development by emphasizing dynamic optimization alongside scale. It bridges artificial intelligence with physics and biological cortical network function inspiring novel self-tuning strategies in DNNs. The findings offer a theoretically grounded path forward in designing efficient, adaptable, and high-performing artificial intelligence systems drawing inspiration from principles observed in biological neural systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying what aspects of brain activity are responsible for conscious perception remains one of the most challenging problems in science. While progress has been made through psychophysical studies employing EEG and fMRI, research would greatly benefit from improved methods for stimulating the brain in healthy human subjects. Traditional techniques for neural stimulation through the skull, including electrical or magnetic stimulation, suffer from coarse spatial resolution and have limited ability to target deep brain structures with high spatial selectivity. Over the past decade, a new tool has emerged known as transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which enables the human brain to be stimulated safely and non-invasively through the skull with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, including cortical as well as deep brain structures. This tool offers an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs in consciousness research. Given the extensive preparation and regulatory approvals associated with tFUS testing, careful experimental planning is essential. Therefore, our goal here is to provide a roadmap for using tFUS in humans for exploring the neural substrate of conscious perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI) aim to decode behavior from neural population activity, enabling individuals with motor impairments to regain motor functions and communication abilities. A key challenge in long-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across recording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In this work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from the test session. To further promote model robustness to population variability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for iBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark, covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature, however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities, overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency, achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of vascular contributions to brain health.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The coordinated activity of neural populations underlies myriad brain functions. Manipulating this activity using brain stimulation techniques has great potential for scientific and clinical applications, as it provides a tool to causally influence brain function. The state of the brain affects how neural populations respond to incoming sensory stimuli. Thus, taking into account pre-stimulation neural population activity may be crucial to achieve a desired causal manipulation using stimulation. In this work, we propose Online MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a brain stimulation framework that leverages brain state information to find stimulation parameters that can drive neural population activity toward specified states. OMiSO includes two key advances: i) it leverages the pre-stimulation brain state to choose optimal stimulation parameters, and ii) it adaptively refines the choice of those parameters by considering newly-observed stimulation responses. We tested OMiSO by applying intracortical electrical microstimulation in a monkey and found that it outperformed competing methods that do not incorporate these advances. Taken together, OMiSO provides greater accuracy in achieving specified activity states, thereby advancing neuromodulation technologies for understanding the brain and for treating brain disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important, low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding speech from brain signals is a challenging research problem. Although existing technologies have made progress in reconstructing the mel spectrograms of auditory stimuli at the word or letter level, there remain core challenges in the precise reconstruction of minute-level continuous imagined speech: traditional models struggle to balance the efficiency of temporal dependency modeling and information retention in long-sequence decoding. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network (DMF2Mel), which consists of four core components: the Dynamic Contrastive Feature Aggregation Module (DC-FAM), the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Network (HAMS-Net), the SplineMap attention mechanism, and the bidirectional state space module (convMamba). Specifically, the DC-FAM separates speech-related "foreground features" from noisy "background features" through local convolution and global attention mechanisms, effectively suppressing interference and enhancing the representation of transient signals. HAMS-Net, based on the U-Net framework,achieves cross-scale fusion of high-level semantics and low-level details. The SplineMap attention mechanism integrates the Adaptive Gated Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AGKAN) to combine global context modeling with spline-based local fitting. The convMamba captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity and enhances nonlinear dynamic modeling capabilities. Results on the SparrKULee dataset show that DMF2Mel achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.074 in mel spectrogram reconstruction for known subjects (a 48% improvement over the baseline) and 0.048 for unknown subjects (a 35% improvement over the baseline).Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DMF2Mel.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However, EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific) factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15 participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax. Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile, such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes - is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques - time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception, maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Undirected graphical models are powerful tools for uncovering complex relationships among high-dimensional variables. This paper aims to fully recover the structure of an undirected graphical model when the data naturally take matrix form, such as temporal multivariate data.   As conventional vector-variate analyses have clear limitations in handling such matrix-structured data, several approaches have been proposed, mostly relying on the likelihood of the Gaussian distribution with a separable covariance structure. Although some of these methods provide theoretical guarantees against false inclusions (i.e. all identified edges exist in the true graph), they may suffer from crucial limitations: (1) failure to detect important true edges, or (2) dependency on conditions for the estimators that have not been verified.   We propose a novel regression-based method for estimating matrix graphical models, based on the relationship between partial correlations and regression coefficients. Adopting the primal-dual witness technique from the regression framework, we derive a non-asymptotic inequality for exact recovery of an edge set. Under suitable regularity conditions, our method consistently identifies the true edge set with high probability.   Through simulation studies, we compare the support recovery performance of the proposed method against existing alternatives. We also apply our method to an electroencephalography (EEG) dataset to estimate both the spatial brain network among 64 electrodes and the temporal network across 256 time points.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Time series classification is crucial for numerous scientific and engineering applications. In this article, we present a numerically efficient, practically competitive, and theoretically rigorous classification method for distinguishing between two classes of locally stationary time series based on their time-domain, second-order characteristics. Our approach builds on the autoregressive approximation for locally stationary time series, combined with an ensemble aggregation and a distance-based threshold for classification. It imposes no requirement on the training sample size, and is shown to achieve zero misclassification error rate asymptotically when the underlying time series differ only mildly in their second-order characteristics. The new method is demonstrated to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art solutions, including wavelet-based, tree-based, convolution-based methods, as well as modern deep learning methods, through intensive numerical simulations and a real EEG data analysis for epilepsy classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).   We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture, which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these, Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic Transformer with other deep learning techniques (convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for future research endeavors.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.</td>

It remains unknown whether non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can support volitional communication in CLIS. Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered "Yes"/"No" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring basic communication in CLIS.</td>

To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in ecological settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI. The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning, and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with similar content and structure from EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying what aspects of brain activity are responsible for conscious perception remains one of the most challenging problems in science. While progress has been made through psychophysical studies employing EEG and fMRI, research would greatly benefit from improved methods for stimulating the brain in healthy human subjects. Traditional techniques for neural stimulation through the skull, including electrical or magnetic stimulation, suffer from coarse spatial resolution and have limited ability to target deep brain structures with high spatial selectivity. Over the past decade, a new tool has emerged known as transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which enables the human brain to be stimulated safely and non-invasively through the skull with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, including cortical as well as deep brain structures. This tool offers an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs in consciousness research. Given the extensive preparation and regulatory approvals associated with tFUS testing, careful experimental planning is essential. Therefore, our goal here is to provide a roadmap for using tFUS in humans for exploring the neural substrate of conscious perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Historically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain has focused primarily on gray matter, particularly the cortical gray matter and associated nuclei. However, recent work has demonstrated that functional activity in white matter also plays a meaningful role in both cognition and learning. In previous work, we introduced the High Angular Resolution Functional Imaging (HARFI) pipeline, which demonstrated both local and global patterns of functional correlation in white matter. Notably, HARFI enabled exploration of asymmetric voxel-wise correlation using odd-order spherical harmonics. Although the original implementation of HARFI was released via GitHub, adoption was limited due to the technical complexity of running the source code. In this work, we present a robust and efficient containerized version of the HARFI pipeline, enabling seamless execution across multiple public datasets. Our goal is to facilitate broader and deeper exploration of functional white matter architecture, especially through the lens of high angular resolution functional correlations. The key innovation of this work is the containerized implementation, which we have made available under a permissive open-source license to support reproducible and accessible research practices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How does the information flow between different brain regions during various stimuli? This is the question we aim to address by studying complex cognitive paradigms in terms of Information Theory. To assess creativity and the emergence of patterns from a Shannon perspective, we applied a range of tools, including Entropy Density, Effective Measure Complexity, and the Lempel-Ziv distance. These entropic tools enable the detection of both linear and non-linear dynamics without relying on pre-established parameters, models, or prior assumptions about the data. To identify connections between different brain regions, we analyse task-based fMRI data from subjects during motor, working memory, emotion recognition, and language stimuli to gain insight into these complex cognitive processes. Since this method does not rely on prior knowledge, it is particularly well-suited for exploratory research, facilitating the discovery of previously unidentified connections or patterns in the brain. The capacity to identify non-linear dynamics is especially important for studying brain connectivity, as the brain exhibits significant non-linear interactions across multiple functional levels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods, including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress, reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states. Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis of metastability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale neural mass models have been widely used to simulate resting-state brain activity from structural connectivity. In this work, we extend a well-established Wilson--Cowan framework by introducing a novel hemispheric-specific coupling scheme that differentiates between intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric structural interactions. We apply this model to empirical cortical connectomes and resting-state fMRI data from matched control and schizophrenia groups. Simulated functional connectivity is computed from the band-limited envelope correlations of regional excitatory activity and compared against empirical functional connectivity matrices. Our results show that incorporating hemispheric asymmetries enhances the correlation between simulated and empirical functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of anatomically-informed coupling strategies in improving the biological realism of large-scale brain network models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However, existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be made publicly available at this https://github.com/arunkumar-kannan/BrainMT-fMRI</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human languages differ widely in their forms, each having distinct sounds, scripts, and syntax. Yet, they can all convey similar meaning. Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions, particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.</td>

To promote accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate targeting is critical for the effectiveness of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation. While CT provides accurate skull acoustic properties, its ionizing radiation and poor soft tissue contrast limit clinical applicability. In contrast, MRI offers superior neuroanatomical visualization without radiation exposure but lacks skull property mapping. This study proposes a novel, fully CT free simulation framework that integrates MRI-derived synthetic CT (sCT) with efficient modeling techniques for rapid and precise tFUS targeting. We trained a deep-learning model to generate sCT from T1-weighted MRI and integrated it with both full-wave (k-Wave) and accelerated simulation methods, hybrid angular spectrum (kWASM) and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld ASM (RSASM). Across five skull models, both full-wave and hybrid pipelines using sCT demonstrated sub-millimeter targeting deviation, focal shape consistency (FWHM ~3.3-3.8 mm), and <0.2 normalized pressure error compared to CT-based gold standard. Notably, the kW-ASM and RS-ASM pipelines reduced simulation time from ~3320 s to 187 s and 34 s respectively, achieving ~94% and ~90% time savings. These results confirm that MRI-derived sCT combined with innovative rapid simulation techniques enables fast, accurate, and radiation-free tFUS planning, supporting its feasibility for scalable clinical applications.</td>

Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches. Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging repositories.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Ultrasound imaging of the cortex of long bones may enable the measurement of the cortical thickness and the ultrasound wave speed in cortical bone tissue. However, with bone loss, the cortical porosity and the size of the pores increase, resulting in strong ultrasound diffuse scattering whose magnitude can exceed that of the specular reflection from the bone-marrow (endosteal) interface. In this study we adapt to bone a specular beamforming technique proposed to better image a needle in soft tissue. Our approach takes into account both wave refraction and specular reflection physics to enhance the contrast of bone surfaces and reduce speckle from intracortical pores. In vivo ultrasound data were acquired at the center of the human tibia in a plane normal to the bone axis of 11 young healthy volunteeers. Ex vivo ultrasound data were acquired from 16 regions of interest from the femoral diaphysis of three elderly donors (donors 66-98 y.o.) using a 2.5 MHz US transducer. A single-element trans mission synthetic aperture imaging sequence was implemented on a research ultrasound system with a 2.5MHz phased array transducer. Image reconstruction was performed: (A) a delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm with optimized f-number, correction of refraction at the soft tissue-bone interface and subject-specific ultrasound wave speed and (B) an adaptive algorithm using Snells law of reflection. The improvement of image quality was evaluated with contrast ratios of the average intensities: CEI between the endosteal surface and the center of the cortex. In vivo, specular beamforming improved the visibility of the endosteum (CEI ) by 1 to 13 dB while maintaining the relative contrast between the outer and inner surfaces of the cortex. These results suggest that the visualization of the intra-osseous anatomy can be enhanced if Snells law and wave refraction are taken into account during image reconstruction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless, its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution for universal medical image segmentation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.</td>
