<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MRI measurements from a decade-old study of the physical properties of brain tissue observed a dynamic, pulsating fluid flow in the interstitial spaces of the brain attributed to the cardiac cycle. The effects of this cyclic flow pattern on the spatial distribution of molecules in the brain are modeled in this paper. The effects of oscillatory flow on the dispersion or volumetric transmission of a molecule that is advected by this flow is modeled by a mechanism hitherto neglected in the literature. An oscillatory random walk model is used to estimate the spread or effective diffusivity due to the oscillatory advection. Then, respiration effects are also estimated and the additional dispersion of molecules due to this are calculated in our model. Our model indicates that the observed oscillatory flow in the interstitial spaces due to cardiac as well as respiratory pulsatility can induce an effective diffusivity when the spread of the molecule is observed over times long compared with a cycle of the oscillation. This would help explain the high-volume transmission within the interstitium or brain parenchyma found in MRI measurements of a marker infused into the cerebrospinal fluid in human subjects that is well above what would be expected. Interstitial spaces should be viewed as a region of dynamic oscillatory flow driven by cardiac and respiratory cycles. This oscillatory flow could result in a significant dispersion of molecules and explain the higher-than-expected effective diffusion suggested in human studies. It may be possible to augment or slow this flow and concomitant spread by applying external forces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Detecting brief changes in time-series data remains a major challenge in fields where short-lived states carry meaning. In single-molecule localisation microscopy, this problem is particularly acute as fluorescent molecules used to tag protein oligomers display heterogenous photophysical behaviour that can complicate photobleach step analysis; a key step in resolving nanoscale protein organisation. Existing methods often require extensive filtering or prior calibration, and can fail to accurately account for blinking or reversible dark states that may contaminate downstream analysis. In this paper, an extension to RJMCMC is proposed for change point detection with heterogeneous temporal dynamics. This approach is applied to the problem of estimating per-frame active fluorophore counts from one-dimensional integrated intensity traces derived from Fluorescence Localisation Imaging with Photobleaching (FLImP), where compound change point pair moves are introduced to better account for short-lived events known as blinking and dark states. The approach is validated using simulated and experimental data, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness when compared with current photobleach step analysis methods and with the existing analysis approach for FLImP data. This Compound RJMCMC (CRJMCMC) algorithm performs reliably across a wide range of fluorophore counts and signal-to-noise conditions, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) down to 0.001 and counts as high as seventeen fluorophores, while also effectively estimating low counts observed when studying EGFR oligomerisation. Beyond single molecule imaging, this work has applications for a variety of time series change point detection problems with heterogeneous state persistence. For example, electrocorticography brain-state segmentation, fault detection in industrial process monitoring and realised volatility in financial time series.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The recent reconstruction of the Drosophila brain provides a neural network of unprecedented size and level of details. In this work, we study the geometrical properties of this system by applying network embedding techniques to the graph of synaptic connections. Since previous analysis have revealed an inhomogeneous degree distribution, we first employ a hyperbolic embedding approach that maps the neural network onto a point cloud in the two-dimensional hyperbolic space. In general, hyperbolic embedding methods exploit the exponentially growing volume of hyperbolic space with increasing distance from the origin, allowing for an approximately uniform spatial distribution of nodes even in scale-free, small-world networks. By evaluating multiple embedding quality metrics, we find that the network structure is well captured by the resulting two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding, and in fact is more congruent with this representation than with the original neuron coordinates in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In order to examine the network geometry in a broader context, we also apply the well-known Euclidean network embedding approach Node2vec, where the dimension of the embedding space, $d$ can be set arbitrarily. In 3 dimensions, the Euclidean embedding of the network yields lower quality scores compared to the original neuron coordinates. However, as a function of the embedding dimension the scores show an improving tendency, surpassing the level of the 2d hyperbolic embedding roughly at $d=16$, and reaching a maximum around $d=64$. Since network embeddings can serve as valuable inputs for a variety of downstream machine learning tasks, our results offer new perspectives on the structure and representation of this recently revealed and biologically significant neural network.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals.

Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in radiology report generation (RRG) have been driven by large paired image-text datasets; however, progress in neuro-oncology has been limited due to a lack of open paired image-report datasets. Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG. Finally, we introduce BTReport-BraTS, a companion dataset that augments BraTS imaging with synthetically generated radiology reports produced with BTReport. Code for this project can be found at  https://github.com/KurtLabUW/BTReport.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the dynamic nature of brain connectivity is critical for elucidating neural processing, behavior, and brain disorders. Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models (EFMs) have achieved strong performance under full fine-tuning but exhibit poor generalization when subject-level supervision is limited, a common constraint in real-world clinical settings. We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Developing foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the signal's low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity. Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.</td>

Our approach employs a dual-encoder to extract electrophysiological and semantic features, aligned via contrastive learning in a shared EEG-text embedding space. During inference, clinically relevant EEG-text pairs are retrieved from a vector database as explicit evidence to condition a large language model (LLM) for the generation of evidence-based reports. Evaluated on a private dataset from Wuhan Children's Hospital and the public TUH EEG Events Corpus (TUEV), the framework achieved balanced accuracies of 89.17\% and 71.38\%, with BLEU scores of 89.61\% and 64.14\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that retrieval of explicit evidence enhances both diagnostic performance and clinical interpretability compared to standard black-box methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Driving fatigue is a major contributor to traffic accidents and poses a serious threat to road safety. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measurement of neural activity, yet EEG-based fatigue recognition is hindered by strong non-stationarity and asymmetric neural dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose DeltaGateNet, a novel framework that explicitly captures Bidirectional temporal dynamics for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition. Our key idea is to introduce a Bidirectional Delta module that decomposes first-order temporal differences into positive and negative components, enabling explicit modeling of asymmetric neural activation and suppression patterns. Furthermore, we design a Gated Temporal Convolution module to capture long-term temporal dependencies for each EEG channel using depthwise temporal convolutions and residual learning, preserving channel-wise specificity while enhancing temporal representation robustness. Extensive experiments conducted under both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation settings on the public SEED-VIG and SADT driving fatigue datasets demonstrate that DeltaGateNet consistently outperforms existing methods. On SEED-VIG, DeltaGateNet achieves an intra-subject accuracy of 81.89% and an inter-subject accuracy of 55.55%. On the balanced SADT 2022 dataset, it attains intra-subject and inter-subject accuracies of 96.81% and 83.21%, respectively, while on the unbalanced SADT 2952 dataset, it achieves 96.84% intra-subject and 84.49% inter-subject accuracy. These results indicate that explicitly modeling Bidirectional temporal dynamics yields robust and generalizable performance under varying subject and class-distribution conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tasks ranging from sleep staging to clinical diagnosis traditionally rely on standard polysomnography (PSG) devices, bedside monitors and wearable devices, which capture diverse nocturnal biosignals (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG, SpO$_2$). However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \textit{Demography, Age, Site \& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</td>

To address this gap, we constructed MIND, a public motor imagery fNIRS-EEG dataset based on a four-class directional MI paradigm of the right upper limb. The dataset includes 64-channel EEG recordings (1000 Hz) and 51-channel fNIRS recordings (47.62 Hz) from 30 participants (12 females, 18 males; aged 19.0-25.0 years). We analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG spectral power and hemodynamic responses, and validate the potential advantages of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCIs in terms of classification accuracy. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the evaluation and comparison of neuroimaging analysis and decoding methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) underpins neuroscience, clinical neurophysiology, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), yet pronounced inter- and intra-subject variability limits reliability, reproducibility, and translation. This systematic review studies that quantified or modeled EEG variability across resting-state, event-related potentials (ERPs), and task-related/BCI paradigms (including motor imagery and SSVEP) in healthy and clinical cohorts. Across paradigms, inter-subject differences are typically larger than within-subject fluctuations, but both affect inference and model generalization. Stability is feature-dependent: alpha-band measures and individual alpha peak frequency are often relatively reliable, whereas higher-frequency and many connectivity-derived metrics show more heterogeneous reliability; ERP reliability varies by component, with P300 measures frequently showing moderate-to-good stability. We summarize major sources of variability (biological, state-related, technical, and analytical), review common quantification and modeling approaches (e.g., ICC, CV, SNR, generalizability theory, and multivariate/learning-based methods), and provide recommendations for study design, reporting, and harmonization. Overall, EEG variability should be treated as both a practical constraint to manage and a meaningful signal to leverage for precision neuroscience and robust neurotechnology.</td>

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive, cost-effective modality for capturing neural activity, though traditional methods often struggle with cross-subject variability and task-specific preprocessing. We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression. These results position BFMs as efficient and interpretable tools for continuous cognitive load monitoring in real-world BCIs.</td>

Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play important and complementary roles in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, compared to the low cost and portability of EEG, MEG is more expensive and less portable, which severely limits the practical application of MEG in BCI systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the dynamic nature of brain connectivity is critical for elucidating neural processing, behavior, and brain disorders. Traditional approaches such as sliding-window correlation (SWC) characterize time-varying undirected associations but do not resolve directional interactions, limiting inference about time-resolved information flow in brain networks. We introduce sliding-window prediction correlation (SWpC), which embeds a directional linear time-invariant (LTI) model within each sliding window to estimate time-varying directed functional connectivity (FC). SWpC yields two complementary descriptors of directed interactions: a strength measure (prediction correlation) and a duration measure (window-wise duration of information transfer). Using concurrent local field potential (LFP) and fMRI BOLD recordings from rat somatosensory cortices, we demonstrate stable directionality estimates in both LFP band-limited power and BOLD. Using Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task fMRI, SWpC detects significant task-evoked changes in directed FC strength and duration and shows higher sensitivity than SWC for identifying task-evoked connectivity differences. Finally, in post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD), SWpC reveals reproducible vestibular-multisensory brain-state shifts and improves healthy-control vs subacute patient (HC-ST) discrimination using state-derived features. Together, these results show that SWpC provides biologically interpretable, time-resolved directed connectivity patterns across multimodal validation and clinical application settings, supporting both basic and translational neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic reasoning across multimodal domains. However, their integration with graph-based models of brain connectivity remains limited. In addition, most existing fMRI analysis methods rely on static Functional Connectivity (FC) representations, which obscure transient neural dynamics critical for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Recent state-space approaches, including Mamba, model temporal structure efficiently, but are typically used as standalone feature extractors without explicit high-level reasoning. We propose NeuroMambaLLM, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic latent graph learning and selective state-space temporal modelling with LLMs. The proposed method learns the functional connectivity dynamically from raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) time series, replacing fixed correlation graphs with adaptive latent connectivity while suppressing motion-related artifacts and capturing long-range temporal dependencies. The resulting dynamic brain representations are projected into the embedding space of an LLM model, where the base language model remains frozen and lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are trained for parameter-efficient alignment. This design enables the LLM to perform both diagnostic classification and language-based reasoning, allowing it to analyze dynamic fMRI patterns and generate clinically meaningful textual reports.</td>

We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroimaging has profoundly enhanced our understanding of the human brain by characterizing its structure, function, and connectivity through modalities like MRI, fMRI, EEG, and PET. These technologies have enabled major breakthroughs across the lifespan, from early brain development to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite these advances, the brain is a complex, multiscale system, and neuroimaging measurements are correspondingly high-dimensional. This creates major statistical challenges, including measurement noise, motion-related artifacts, substantial inter-subject and site/scanner variability, and the sheer scale of modern studies. This paper explores statistical opportunities and challenges in neuroimaging across four key areas: (i) brain development from birth to age 20, (ii) the adult and aging brain, (iii) neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders, and (iv) brain encoding and decoding. After a quick tutorial on major imaging technologies, we review cutting-edge studies, underscore data and modeling challenges, and highlight research opportunities for statisticians. We conclude by emphasizing that close collaboration among statisticians, neuroscientists, and clinicians is essential for translating neuroimaging advances into improved diagnostics, deeper mechanistic insight, and more personalized treatments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To be practical for real-life applications, models for brain-computer interfaces must be easily and quickly deployable on new subjects, effective on affordable scanning hardware, and small enough to run locally on accessible computing resources. To directly address these current limitations, we introduce ENIGMA, a multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG)-to-Image decoding model that reconstructs seen images from EEG recordings and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the research-grade THINGS-EEG2 and consumer-grade AllJoined-1.6M benchmarks, while fine-tuning effectively on new subjects with as little as 15 minutes of data. ENIGMA boasts a simpler architecture and requires less than 1% of the trainable parameters necessary for previous approaches. Our approach integrates a subject-unified spatio-temporal backbone along with a set of multi-subject latent alignment layers and an MLP projector to map raw EEG signals to a rich visual latent space. We evaluate our approach using a broad suite of image reconstruction metrics that have been standardized in the adjacent field of fMRI-to-Image research, and we describe the first EEG-to-Image study to conduct extensive behavioral evaluations of our reconstructions using human raters. Our simple and robust architecture provides a significant performance boost across both research-grade and consumer-grade EEG hardware, and a substantial improvement in fine-tuning efficiency and inference cost. Finally, we provide extensive ablations to determine the architectural choices most responsible for our performance gains in both single and multi-subject cases across multiple benchmark datasets. Collectively, our work provides a substantial step towards the development of practical brain-computer interface applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive brain disorder classification by capturing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines. Our findings advocate for a shift toward end-to-end temporal modeling in fMRI analysis to better capture complex brain dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/DeCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how humans and artificial intelligence systems process complex narrative videos is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent experimental observations, most notably those reported by the ATOMKI and Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment (PADME) collaborations, have hinted anomalies that may indicate the presence of a new resonance with a mass around $17\,\text{MeV}$, potentially interacting with both nucleons and electrons. Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$.   Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG~II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\,\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, with $\ell_α\ne\ell_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell_α\ell_β\big)\propto\big| η_{βα} \big|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell_α\ell_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play important and complementary roles in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, compared to the low cost and portability of EEG, MEG is more expensive and less portable, which severely limits the practical application of MEG in BCI systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.</td>

To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization.

Having annotated the text, we employ force-alignment of the text and audio to align our sentiment labels with the brain recordings. It is straightforward then to train Brainto-Sentiment models on these data. Experimental results show an improvement in balanced accuracy for Brain-to-Sentiment compared to baseline, supporting the proposed approach as a proof-of-concept for leveraging existing MEG datasets and learning to decode sentiment directly from the brain.</td>

Three configurations were employed recording magnetocardiography (MCG) signals in various shielded and unshielded environments. The signals were averaged over a few hundreds up to several thousands of heart beats to detect the MCG traces. The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</td>

Existing neuroimaging techniques, including EEG, MEG, and fMRI, are limited by trade-offs in sensitivity and spatial or temporal resolution. Here we propose quantum sensing MRI (qsMRI), a noninvasive approach that enables direct detection of neuronal firing-induced magnetic fields using a clinical MRI system. qsMRI exploits endogenous proton (1H) nuclear spins in water molecules as intrinsic quantum sensors and decodes time-resolved phase information from free induction decay (FID) signals to infer neuronal magnetic fields. We validate qsMRI through simulations, phantom experiments, and human studies at rest and during motor tasks, and provide open experimental procedures to facilitate independent validation. We further present a case study demonstrating potential applications to neurological disorders. qsMRI represents a first-in-human application of quantum sensing on a clinical MRI platform, establishes a non-BOLD functional imaging modality, and enables interrogation of neuronal firing dynamics in both cortical and deep brain regions.</td>

They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.</td>

Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, "brain-based" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies "true" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</td>

A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MRI measurements from a decade-old study of the physical properties of brain tissue observed a dynamic, pulsating fluid flow in the interstitial spaces of the brain attributed to the cardiac cycle. The effects of this cyclic flow pattern on the spatial distribution of molecules in the brain are modeled in this paper. The effects of oscillatory flow on the dispersion or volumetric transmission of a molecule that is advected by this flow is modeled by a mechanism hitherto neglected in the literature. An oscillatory random walk model is used to estimate the spread or effective diffusivity due to the oscillatory advection. Then, respiration effects are also estimated and the additional dispersion of molecules due to this are calculated in our model. Our model indicates that the observed oscillatory flow in the interstitial spaces due to cardiac as well as respiratory pulsatility can induce an effective diffusivity when the spread of the molecule is observed over times long compared with a cycle of the oscillation. This would help explain the high-volume transmission within the interstitium or brain parenchyma found in MRI measurements of a marker infused into the cerebrospinal fluid in human subjects that is well above what would be expected. Interstitial spaces should be viewed as a region of dynamic oscillatory flow driven by cardiac and respiratory cycles. This oscillatory flow could result in a significant dispersion of molecules and explain the higher-than-expected effective diffusion suggested in human studies. It may be possible to augment or slow this flow and concomitant spread by applying external forces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical vision-language models (VLMs) are strong zero-shot recognizers for medical imaging, but their reliability under domain shift hinges on calibrated uncertainty with guarantees. Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute. Comprehensive ablations and qualitative analyses show that \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} sharpens zero-shot predictions without compromising exchangeability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Clinical free-text notes contain vital patient information. They are structured into labelled sections; recognizing these sections has been shown to support clinical decision-making and downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed.</td>

In this work, we investigate whether "small" LLMs (around one billion parameters) can effectively perform medical tasks while maintaining competitive accuracy. We evaluate models from three major families-Llama-3, Gemma-3, and Qwen3-across 20 clinical NLP tasks among Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Case Report Form Filling, Question Answering, and Argument Mining. We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives. Our results show that small LLMs can match or even surpass larger baselines, with our best configuration based on Qwen3-1.7B achieving an average score +9.2 points higher than Qwen3-32B. We release a comprehensive collection of all the publicly available Italian medical datasets for NLP tasks, together with our top-performing models. Furthermore, we release an Italian dataset of 126M words from the Emergency Department of an Italian Hospital, and 175M words from various sources that we used for continual pre-training.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Breastfeeding efficiency relies on coordinated tongue motion, sustained tissue contact and maintenance of an effective intraoral seal. Current assessments of seal formation mainly use local kinematic descriptors or pressure recordings, which do not capture the global structural continuity of the sealing region. We introduce a systolic geometry based approach in which each sagittal ultrasound frame is modeled as a two dimensional deformable domain bounded by tongue, palate and nipple contours. Global seal continuity is formalized through the shortest closed curve that cannot be contracted to a point because of the overall geometry of the domain. The nipple defines a central region that must be circumferentially enclosed by a contact band to maintain suction. Within this band, closed curves encircling the nipple exactly once can be identified; the shortest of these curves defines a normalized systolic index representing the tightest admissible sealing loop. Simulations of symmetric thinning, localized discontinuities and cyclic perturbations reveal feasibility boundaries separating seal preserving from seal breaking configurations. Notably, admissible encircling curves may transiently disappear even when overall geometric motion remains smooth. By capturing global circumferential continuity that cannot be inferred from local metrics alone, our approach generates testable hypotheses linking the existence and temporal stability of admissible encircling curves to milk transfer efficiency and vacuum stability. Applied to segmented ultrasound data and integrated with pressure measurements, our systolic approach could provide a quantitative framework for objective assessment of seal integrity and longitudinal monitoring of latch stability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Diffraction tomography is a widely used inverse scattering technique for quantitative imaging of weakly scattering media. In its conventional formulation, diffraction tomography assumes monochromatic plane wave illumination. This assumption, however, represents a simplification that often fails to reflect practical imaging systems such as medical ultrasound, where focused beams are used to scan a region of interest of the human body. Such measurement setups, combining focused illumination with scanning, have not yet been incorporated into the diffraction tomography framework. To bridge this gap, we extend diffraction tomography by modeling incident fields as Herglotz waves, thereby incorporating focused beams into the theory. Within this setting, we derive a new Fourier diffraction relation, which forms the basis for quantitative tomographic reconstruction from scanning data. Using this result, we systematically analyze how different scan geometries influence the reconstruction.</td>

However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.</td>
