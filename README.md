<td style='padding: 4px;'>Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Confocal Raman microscopy, a highly specific and label-free technique for the microscale study of thick samples, often presents difficulties due to weak Raman signals. Inhomogeneous samples introduce wavefront aberrations that further reduce these signals, requiring even longer acquisition times. In this study, we introduce adaptive optics to confocal Raman microscopy for the first time to counteract such aberrations, significantly increasing the Raman signal and image quality. The method is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing commercial microscopes without hardware modifications. It uses a wavefront sensorless approach to derive aberrations using an optofluidic, transmissive spatial light modulator that can be attached to the microscope nosepiece. Our experimental results demonstrate the compensation of aberrations caused by artificial scatterers and mouse brain tissue, improving spatial resolution and achieving up to 3.5-fold signal enhancements. Our results provide a basis for the molecular label-free study of biological systems at greater imaging depths.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Central banks are actively exploring retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), with the Bank of England currently in the design phase for a potential UK retail CBDC, the digital pound. In a previous paper, we defined and explored the important concept of functional consistency (which is the principle that different forms of money have the same operational characteristics) and evaluated design options to support functional consistency across digital pounds and commercial bank money, based on a set of key capabilities. In this paper, we continue to analyse the design options for supporting functional consistency and, in order to perform a detailed analysis, we focus on three key capabilities: communication between digital pound ecosystem participants, funds locking, and interoperability across digital pounds and commercial bank money. We explore these key capabilities via three payments use cases: person-to-person push payment, merchant-initiated request to pay, and lock funds and pay on physical delivery. We then present and evaluate the suitability of design options to provide the specific capabilities for each use case and draw initial insights. We conclude that a financial market infrastructure (FMI) providing specific capabilities could simplify the experience of ecosystem participants, simplify the operating platforms for both the Bank of England and digital pound Payment Interface Providers (PIPs), and facilitate the creation of innovative services. We also identify potential next steps.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we propose an improved Unet model for brain tumor image segmentation, which combines coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module to improve the segmentation effect. After the data set is divided, we do the necessary preprocessing to the image and use the improved model to experiment. First, we trained and validated the traditional Unet model. By analyzing the loss curve of the training set and the validation set, we can see that the loss value continues to decline at the first epoch and becomes stable at the eighth epoch. This process shows that the model constantly optimizes its parameters to improve performance. At the same time, the change in the miou (mean Intersection over Union) index shows that the miou value exceeded 0.6 at the 15th epoch, remained above 0.6 thereafter, and reached above 0.7 at the 46th epoch. These results indicate that the basic Unet model is effective in brain tumor image segmentation. Next, we introduce an improved Unet algorithm based on coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module for experiments. By observing the loss change curves of the training set and the verification set, it is found that the loss value reaches the lowest point at the sixth epoch and then remains relatively stable. At the same time, the miou indicator has stabilized above 0.7 since the 20th epoch and has reached a maximum of 0.76. These results show that the new mechanism introduced significantly improves the segmentation ability of the model. Finally, we apply the trained traditional Unet model and the improved Unet model based on the coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module to the test set for brain tumor image segmentation prediction. Compared to the traditional Unet, the enhanced model offers superior segmentation and edge accuracy, providing a more reliable method for medical image analysis with the coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning models generating structural brain MRIs have the potential to significantly accelerate discovery of neuroscience studies. However, their use has been limited in part by the way their quality is evaluated. Most evaluations of generative models focus on metrics originally designed for natural images (such as structural similarity index and Frechet inception distance). As we show in a comparison of 6 state-of-the-art generative models trained and tested on over 3000 MRIs, these metrics are sensitive to the experimental setup and inadequately assess how well brain MRIs capture macrostructural properties of brain regions (i.e., anatomical plausibility). This shortcoming of the metrics results in inconclusive findings even when qualitative differences between the outputs of models are evident. We therefore propose a framework for evaluating models generating brain MRIs, which requires uniform processing of the real MRIs, standardizing the implementation of the models, and automatically segmenting the MRIs generated by the models. The segmentations are used for quantifying the plausibility of anatomy displayed in the MRIs. To ensure meaningful quantification, it is crucial that the segmentations are highly reliable. Our framework rigorously checks this reliability, a step often overlooked by prior work. Only 3 of the 6 generative models produced MRIs, of which at least 95% had highly reliable segmentations. More importantly, the assessment of each model by our framework is in line with qualitative assessments, reinforcing the validity of our approach.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Several concepts borrowed from graph theory are routinely used to better understand the inner workings of the (human) brain. To this end, a connectivity network of the brain is built first, which then allows one to assess quantities such as information flow and information routing via shortest path and maximum flow computations. Since brain networks typically contain several thousand nodes and edges, computational scaling is a key research area. In this contribution, we focus on approximate maximum flow computations in large brain networks. By combining graph partitioning with maximum flow computations, we propose a new approximation algorithm for the computation of the maximum flow with runtime O(|V||E|^2/k^2) compared to the usual runtime of O(|V||E|^2) for the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges, and $k$ is the number of partitions. We assess both accuracy and runtime of the proposed algorithm on simulated graphs as well as on graphs downloaded from the Brain Networks Data Repository (https://networkrepository.com).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We examine the prevalence of truncated star-forming disks in the Virgo cluster down to $M_* \simeq 10^7 ~\text{M}_{\odot}$. This work makes use of deep, high-resolution imaging in the H$\alpha$+[NII] narrow-band from the Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) and optical imaging from the Next Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS). To aid in understanding the effects of the cluster environment on star formation in Virgo galaxies, we take a physically-motivated approach to define the edge of the star-forming disk via a drop-off in the radial specific star formation rate profile. Comparing with the expected sizes of normal galactic disks provides a measure of how truncated star-forming disks are in the cluster. We find that truncated star-forming disks are nearly ubiquitous across all regions of the Virgo cluster, including beyond the virial radius (0.974 Mpc). The majority of truncated disks at large clustercentric radii are of galaxies likely on first infall. As the intra-cluster medium density is low in this region, it is difficult to explain this population with solely ram-pressure stripping. A plausible explanation is that these galaxies are undergoing starvation of their gas supply before ram-pressure stripping becomes the dominant quenching mechanism. A simple model of starvation shows that this mechanism can produce moderate disk truncations within 1-2 Gyr. This model is consistent with `slow-then-rapid' or `delayed-then-rapid' quenching, where the early starvation mode drives disk truncations without significant change to the integrated star formation rate, and the later ram-pressure stripping mode rapidly quenches the galaxy. The origin of starvation may be in the group structures that exist around the main Virgo cluster, which indicates the importance of understanding pre-processing of galaxies beyond the cluster virial radius.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Segmenting brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging enables performing quantitative analysis in support of clinical trials and personalized patient care. This analysis provides the potential to impact clinical decision-making processes, including diagnosis and prognosis. In 2023, the well-established Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge presented a substantial expansion with eight tasks and 4,500 brain tumor cases. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based ensemble strategy that is evaluated for newly included tumor cases in three tasks: pediatric brain tumors (PED), intracranial meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET). In particular, we ensemble outputs from state-of-the-art nnU-Net and Swin UNETR models on a region-wise basis. Furthermore, we implemented a targeted post-processing strategy based on a cross-validated threshold search to improve the segmentation results for tumor sub-regions. The evaluation of our proposed method on unseen test cases for the three tasks resulted in lesion-wise Dice scores for PED: 0.653, 0.809, 0.826; MEN: 0.876, 0.867, 0.849; and MET: 0.555, 0.6, 0.58; for the enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively. Our method was ranked first for PED, third for MEN, and fourth for MET, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers are exploring novel computational paradigms such as sparse coding and neuromorphic computing to bridge the efficiency gap between the human brain and conventional computers in complex tasks. A key area of focus is neuromorphic audio processing. While the Locally Competitive Algorithm has emerged as a promising solution for sparse coding, offering potential for real-time and low-power processing on neuromorphic hardware, its applications in neuromorphic speech classification have not been thoroughly studied. The Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm builds upon the Locally Competitive Algorithm by dynamically adjusting the modulation parameters of the filter bank to fine-tune the filters' sensitivity. This adaptability enhances lateral inhibition, improving reconstruction quality, sparsity, and convergence time, which is crucial for real-time applications. This paper demonstrates the potential of the Locally Competitive Algorithm and its adaptive variant as robust feature extractors for neuromorphic speech classification. Results show that the Locally Competitive Algorithm achieves better speech classification accuracy at the expense of higher power consumption compared to the LAUSCHER cochlea model used for benchmarking. On the other hand, the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm mitigates this power consumption issue without compromising the accuracy. The dynamic power consumption is reduced to a range of 4 to 13 milliwatts on neuromorphic hardware, three orders of magnitude less than setups using Graphics Processing Units. These findings position the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm as a compelling solution for efficient speech classification systems, promising substantial advancements in balancing speech classification accuracy and power efficiency.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) can help to determine the identity of the attended speaker during an auditory selective attention task, by analyzing and processing measurements of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Most studies on AAD are based on scalp-EEG signals in two-speaker scenarios, which are far from real application. Ear-EEG has recently gained significant attention due to its motion tolerance and invisibility during data acquisition, making it easy to incorporate with other devices for applications. In this work, participants selectively attended to one of the four spatially separated speakers' speech in an anechoic room. The EEG data were concurrently collected from a scalp-EEG system and an ear-EEG system (cEEGrids). Temporal response functions (TRFs) and stimulus reconstruction (SR) were utilized using ear-EEG data. Results showed that the attended speech TRFs were stronger than each unattended speech and decoding accuracy was 41.3\% in the 60s (chance level of 25\%). To further investigate the impact of electrode placement and quantity, SR was utilized in both scalp-EEG and ear-EEG, revealing that while the number of electrodes had a minor effect, their positioning had a significant influence on the decoding accuracy. One kind of auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) method, STAnet, was testified with this ear-EEG database, resulting in 93.1% in 1-second decoding window. The implementation code and database for our work are available on GitHub: https://github.com/zhl486/Ear_EEG_code.git and Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10803261.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Biosignal acquisition is key for healthcare applications and wearable devices, with machine learning offering promising methods for processing signals like surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be prepended to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperform standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study shows that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements, in line with sEMG physiological expectations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG-based emotion recognition holds significant potential in the field of brain-computer interfaces. A key challenge lies in extracting discriminative spatiotemporal features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing studies often rely on domain-specific time-frequency features and analyze temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics separately, neglecting the interaction between local-global relationships and spatiotemporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a novel network called Multi-Scale Inverted Mamba (MS-iMamba), which consists of Multi-Scale Temporal Blocks (MSTB) and Temporal-Spatial Fusion Blocks (TSFB). Specifically, MSTBs are designed to capture both local details and global temporal dependencies across different scale subsequences. The TSFBs, implemented with an inverted Mamba structure, focus on the interaction between dynamic temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics. The primary advantage of MS-iMamba lies in its ability to leverage reconstructed multi-scale EEG sequences, exploiting the interaction between temporal and spatial features without the need for domain-specific time-frequency feature extraction. Experimental results on the DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED datasets demonstrate that MS-iMamba achieves classification accuracies of 94.86%, 94.94%, and 91.36%, respectively, using only four-channel EEG signals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</td>

Tackling this problem demands advanced algorithms, extensive noisy-clean training data, and thorough evaluation strategies. This study presents the Artifact Removal Transformer (ART), an innovative EEG denoising model employing transformer architecture to adeptly capture the transient millisecond-scale dynamics characteristic of EEG signals. Our approach offers a holistic, end-to-end denoising solution for diverse artifact types in multichannel EEG data. We enhanced the generation of noisy-clean EEG data pairs using an independent component analysis, thus fortifying the training scenarios critical for effective supervised learning. We performed comprehensive validations using a wide range of open datasets from various BCI applications, employing metrics like mean squared error and signal-to-noise ratio, as well as sophisticated techniques such as source localization and EEG component classification. Our evaluations confirm that ART surpasses other deep-learning-based artifact removal methods, setting a new benchmark in EEG signal processing. This advancement not only boosts the accuracy and reliability of artifact removal but also promises to catalyze further innovations in the field, facilitating the study of brain dynamics in naturalistic environments.</td>

This study investigates the classification of four hand movements to control a modified Myobock prosthesis via EEG signals. We report results from three EEG recording sessions involving four amputees and twenty able-bodied subjects performing four grasp movements under three conditions: Motor Execution (ME), Motor Imagery (MI), and Motor Observation (MO). EEG preprocessing was followed by feature extraction using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Wavelet Decomposition (WD), and Riemannian Geometry. Various classification algorithms were applied to decode EEG signals, and a metric assessed pattern separability. We evaluated system performance across different electrode combinations and compared it to the original setup. Our results show that distinguishing movement from no movement achieved 100% accuracy, while classification between movements reached 70-90%. No significant differences were found between recording conditions in classification performance. Able-bodied participants outperformed amputees, but there were no significant differences in Motor Imagery. Performance did not improve across the sessions, and there was considerable variability in EEG pattern distinction. Reducing the number of electrodes by half led to only a 2% average accuracy drop. These results provide insights into developing wearable brain-machine interfaces, particularly for electrode optimization and training in grasp movement classification.</td>

While some diagnostic methods exist for Alzheimer's Disease, many of these methods cannot detect Alzheimer's in its earlier stages. Recently, researchers have explored the use of Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology for diagnosing Alzheimer's. EEG is a noninvasive method of recording the brain's electrical signals, and EEG data has shown distinct differences between patients with and without Alzheimer's. In the past, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used to predict Alzheimer's from EEG data, but these models sometimes produce false positive diagnoses. This study aims to compare losses between ANNs and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) across multiple types of epochs, learning rates, and nodes.

The development of AI systems for discerning complex emotions poses a substantial challenge with significant implications for affective computing. Furthermore, obtaining a sizable dataset for CERS proves to be a daunting task due to the intricacies involved in capturing subtle emotions, necessitating specialized methods for data collection and processing. Incorporating physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) can notably enhance CERS by furnishing valuable insights into the user's emotional state, enhancing the quality of datasets, and fortifying system dependability. A comprehensive literature review was conducted in this study to assess the efficacy of machine learning, deep learning, and meta-learning approaches in both basic and complex emotion recognition utilizing EEG, ECG signals, and facial expression datasets. The chosen research papers offer perspectives on potential applications, clinical implications, and results of CERSs, with the objective of promoting their acceptance and integration into clinical decision-making processes. This study highlights research gaps and challenges in understanding CERSs, encouraging further investigation by relevant studies and organizations. Lastly, the significance of meta-learning approaches in improving CERS performance and guiding future research endeavors is underscored.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding neural representations of visual stimuli from electroencephalography (EEG) offers valuable insights into brain activity and cognition. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the field of visual decoding of EEG, primarily focusing on reconstructing the semantic content of visual stimuli. In this paper, we present a novel visual decoding pipeline that, in addition to recovering the content, emphasizes the reconstruction of the style, such as color and texture, of images viewed by the subject. Unlike previous methods, this ``style-based'' approach learns in the CLIP spaces of image and text separately, facilitating a more nuanced extraction of information from EEG signals. We also use captions for text alignment simpler than previously employed, which we find work better. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method better preserves the style of visual stimuli and extracts more fine-grained semantic information from neural signals. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in quantitative results and sets a new state-of-the-art on the popular Brain2Image dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Artifact removal in electroencephalography (EEG) is a longstanding challenge that significantly impacts neuroscientific analysis and brain-computer interface (BCI) performance. Tackling this problem demands advanced algorithms, extensive noisy-clean training data, and thorough evaluation strategies. This study presents the Artifact Removal Transformer (ART), an innovative EEG denoising model employing transformer architecture to adeptly capture the transient millisecond-scale dynamics characteristic of EEG signals. Our approach offers a holistic, end-to-end denoising solution for diverse artifact types in multichannel EEG data. We enhanced the generation of noisy-clean EEG data pairs using an independent component analysis, thus fortifying the training scenarios critical for effective supervised learning. We performed comprehensive validations using a wide range of open datasets from various BCI applications, employing metrics like mean squared error and signal-to-noise ratio, as well as sophisticated techniques such as source localization and EEG component classification. Our evaluations confirm that ART surpasses other deep-learning-based artifact removal methods, setting a new benchmark in EEG signal processing. This advancement not only boosts the accuracy and reliability of artifact removal but also promises to catalyze further innovations in the field, facilitating the study of brain dynamics in naturalistic environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG signal is important for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Nevertheless, existing dry and wet electrodes are difficult to balance between high signal-to-noise ratio and portability in EEG recording, which limits the practical use of BCI. In this study, we propose a Denoising Encoder via Contrastive Alignment Network (DECAN) for dry electrode EEG, under the assumption of the EEG representation consistency between wet and dry electrodes during the same task. Specifically, DECAN employs two parameter-sharing deep neural networks to extract task-relevant representations of dry and wet electrode signals, and then integrates a representation-consistent contrastive loss to minimize the distance between representations from the same timestamp and category but different devices. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we construct an emotion dataset consisting of paired dry and wet electrode EEG signals from 16 subjects with 5 emotions, named PaDWEED. Results on PaDWEED show that DECAN achieves an average accuracy increase of 6.94$\%$ comparing to state-of-the art performance in emotion recognition of dry electrodes. Ablation studies demonstrate a decrease in inter-class aliasing along with noteworthy accuracy enhancements in the delta and beta frequency bands. Moreover, an inter-subject feature alignment can obtain an accuracy improvement of 5.99$\%$ and 5.14$\%$ in intra- and inter-dataset scenarios, respectively. Our proposed method may open up new avenues for BCI with dry electrodes. PaDWEED dataset used in this study is freely available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/peiyu999/PaDWEED.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals allows access to user intentions conveniently, which plays an important role in the fields of human-machine interaction. To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications.</td>

We employed unsupervised learning methods to detect similarities in users' brainwave responses to different spatial features, assess the feasibility of BCI commands. We trained and refined generative AI models for each valuable design command. The command prediction process adopted the motor imagery paradigm from BCI research. We trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict design commands for different spatial features based on EEG features. The results indicate that the Mental-Gen method can effectively interpret design intentions through brainwave signals, assisting users in achieving satisfactory interior space designs using imagined commands.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Breast cancer is a highly fatal disease among cancers in women, and early detection is crucial for treatment. HER2 status, a valuable diagnostic marker based on Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, is instrumental in determining breast cancer status. The high cost of IHC staining and the ubiquity of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining make the conversion from H&E to IHC staining essential. In this article, we propose a destain-restain framework for converting H&E staining to IHC staining, leveraging the characteristic that H&E staining and IHC staining of the same tissue sections share the Hematoxylin channel. We further design loss functions specifically for Hematoxylin and Diaminobenzidin (DAB) channels to generate IHC images exploiting insights from separated staining channels. Beyond the benchmark metrics on BCI contest, we have developed semantic information metrics for the HER2 level. The experimental results demonstrated that our method outperforms previous open-sourced methods in terms of image intrinsic property and semantic information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</td>

This paper explores the historical development of SNN and concludes that these two fields are intersecting and merging rapidly. Following the successful application of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS), SNNs have found some proper paradigms, such as continuous visual signal tracking, automatic speech recognition, and reinforcement learning for continuous control, that have extensively supported their key features, including spike encoding, neuronal heterogeneity, specific functional circuits, and multiscale plasticity. Compared to these real-world paradigms, the brain contains a spiking version of the biology-world paradigm, which exhibits a similar level of complexity and is usually considered a mirror of the real world. Considering the projected rapid development of invasive and parallel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as well as the new BCI-based paradigms that include online pattern recognition and stimulus control of biological spike trains, SNNs naturally leverage their advantages in energy efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The biological brain has inspired the present study of SNNs and effective SNN machine-learning algorithms, which can help enhance neuroscience discoveries in the brain by applying them to the new BCI paradigm. Such two-way interactions with positive feedback can accelerate brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence technology.</td>

ConvNeXt addresses traditional EEG challenges like high dimensionality, noise, and variability, enhancing the precision of mental workload classification.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have garnered significant interest across various domains, including rehabilitation and robotics. Despite advancements in neural network-based EEG decoding, maintaining performance across diverse user populations remains challenging due to feature distribution drift. This paper presents an effective approach to address this challenge by implementing a lightweight and efficient on-device learning engine for wearable motor imagery recognition. The proposed approach, applied to the well-established EEGNet architecture, enables real-time and accurate adaptation to EEG signals from unregistered users. Leveraging the newly released low-power parallel RISC-V-based processor, GAP9 from Greeenwaves, and the Physionet EEG Motor Imagery dataset, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy gain of up to 7.31\% with respect to the baseline with a memory footprint of 15.6 KByte. Furthermore, by optimizing the input stream, we achieve enhanced real-time performance without compromising inference accuracy. Our tailored approach exhibits inference time of 14.9 ms and 0.76 mJ per single inference and 20 us and 0.83 uJ per single update during online training. These findings highlight the feasibility of our method for edge EEG devices as well as other battery-powered wearable AI systems suffering from subject-dependant feature distribution drift.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to visualize brain activation regions by detecting hemodynamic responses associated with increased metabolic demand. While alternative MRI methods have been employed to monitor functional activities, the investigation of in-vivo electrical property changes during brain function remains limited. In this study, we explored the relationship between fMRI signals and electrical conductivity (measured at the Larmor frequency) changes using phase-based electrical properties tomography (EPT). Our results revealed consistent patterns: conductivity changes showed negative correlations, with conductivity decreasing in the functionally active regions whereas B1 phase mapping exhibited positive correlations around activation regions. These observations were consistent across both motor and visual cortex activations. To further substantiate these findings, we conducted electromagnetic radio-frequency simulations that modeled activation states with varying conductivity, which demonstrated trends similar to our in-vivo results for both B1 phase and conductivity. These findings suggest that in-vivo electrical conductivity changes can indeed be measured during brain activity. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving these measurements.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How does the human visual cortex encode sensory information? To address this question, we explore the covariance structure of neural representations. We perform a cross-decomposition analysis of fMRI responses to natural images in multiple individuals from the Natural Scenes Dataset and find that neural representations systematically exhibit a power-law covariance spectrum over four orders of magnitude in ranks. This scale-free structure is found in multiple regions along the visual hierarchy, pointing to the existence of a generic encoding strategy in visual cortex. We also show that, up to a rotation, a large ensemble of principal axes of these population codes are shared across subjects, showing the existence of a universal high-dimensional representation. This suggests a high level of convergence in how the human brain learns to represent natural scenes despite individual differences in neuroanatomy and experience. We further demonstrate that a spectral approach is critical for characterizing population codes in their full extent, and in doing so, we reveal a vast space of uncharted dimensions that have been out of reach for conventional variance-weighted methods. A global view of neural representations thus requires embracing their high-dimensional nature and understanding them statistically rather than through visual or semantic interpretation of individual dimensions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In functional MRI (fMRI), effective connectivity analysis aims at inferring the causal influences that brain regions exert on one another. A common method for this type of analysis is structural equation modeling (SEM). We here propose a novel method to test the validity of a given model of structural equation. Given a structural model in the form of a directed graph, the method extracts the set of all constraints of conditional independence induced by the absence of links between pairs of regions in the model and tests for their validity in a Bayesian framework, either individually (constraint by constraint), jointly (e.g., by gathering all constraints associated with a given missing link), or globally (i.e., all constraints associated with the structural model). This approach has two main advantages. First, it only tests what is testable from observational data and does allow for false causal interpretation. Second, it makes it possible to test each constraint (or group of constraints) separately and, therefore, quantify in what measure each constraint (or, e..g., missing link) is respected in the data. We validate our approach using a simulation study and illustrate its potential benefits through the reanalysis of published data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. By decomposing rs-fMRI signals using DWT, our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Graph theory provides a robust mathematical framework to analyze these complex networks, while machine learning is employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a lesion-aware graph neural network (LEGNet) to predict language ability from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity in patients with post-stroke aphasia. Our model integrates three components: an edge-based learning module that encodes functional connectivity between brain regions, a lesion encoding module, and a subgraph learning module that leverages functional similarities for prediction. We use synthetic data derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for hyperparameter tuning and model pretraining. We then evaluate the performance using repeated 10-fold cross-validation on an in-house neuroimaging dataset of post-stroke aphasia. Our results demonstrate that LEGNet outperforms baseline deep learning methods in predicting language ability. LEGNet also exhibits superior generalization ability when tested on a second in-house dataset that was acquired under a slightly different neuroimaging protocol. Taken together, the results of this study highlight the potential of LEGNet in effectively learning the relationships between rs-fMRI connectivity and language ability in a patient cohort with brain lesions for improved post-stroke aphasia evaluation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mental disorders are among the foremost contributors to the global healthcare challenge. Research indicates that timely diagnosis and intervention are vital in treating various mental disorders. However, the early somatization symptoms of certain mental disorders may not be immediately evident, often resulting in their oversight and misdiagnosis. Additionally, the traditional diagnosis methods incur high time and cost. Deep learning methods based on fMRI and EEG have improved the efficiency of the mental disorder detection process. However, the cost of the equipment and trained staff are generally huge. Moreover, most systems are only trained for a specific mental disorder and are not general-purpose. Recently, physiological studies have shown that there are some speech and facial-related symptoms in a few mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD). In this paper, we focus on the emotional expression features of mental disorders and introduce a multimodal mental disorder diagnosis system based on audio-visual information input. Our proposed system is based on spatial-temporal attention networks and innovative uses a less computationally intensive pre-train audio recognition network to fine-tune the video recognition module for better results. We also apply the unified system for multiple mental disorders (ADHD and depression) for the first time. The proposed system achieves over 80\% accuracy on the real multimodal ADHD dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results on the depression dataset AVEC 2014.</td>

With the help of deep learning, decoding visual information from human brain activity fMRI has achieved promising performance. However, these decoding models require centralized storage of fMRI data to conduct training, leading to potential privacy security issues. In this paper, we focus on privacy preservation in multi-individual brain visual decoding. To this end, we introduce a novel framework called FedMinds, which utilizes federated learning to protect individuals' privacy during model training. In addition, we deploy individual adapters for each subject, thus allowing personalized visual decoding. We conduct experiments on the authoritative NSD datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves high-precision visual decoding along with privacy protection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by subtle changes in cognitive functions, often associated with disruptions in brain connectivity. The present study introduces a novel fine-grained analysis to examine topological alterations in neurodegeneration pertaining to six different brain networks of MCI subjects (Early/Late MCI). To achieve this, fMRI time series from two distinct populations are investigated: (i) the publicly accessible ADNI dataset and (ii) our in-house dataset. The study utilizes sliding window embedding to convert each fMRI time series into a sequence of 3-dimensional vectors, facilitating the assessment of changes in regional brain topology. Distinct persistence diagrams are computed for Betti descriptors of dimension-0, 1, and 2. Wasserstein distance metric is used to quantify differences in topological characteristics. We have examined both (i) ROI-specific inter-subject interactions and (ii) subject-specific inter-ROI interactions. Further, a new deep learning model is proposed for classification, achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 95% for the ADNI dataset and 85% for the in-house dataset. This methodology is further adapted for the differential diagnosis of MCI sub-types, resulting in a peak accuracy of 76.5%, 91.1% and 80% in classifying HC Vs. EMCI, HC Vs. LMCI and EMCI Vs. LMCI, respectively. We showed that the proposed approach surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques designed for classifying MCI and its sub-types using fMRI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Abnormality detection in the identification of a single-subject which deviates from the majority of the dataset that comes from a control group is a critical problem. A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mobile edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence~(GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</td>

The results indicated a dynamic and steady growth trend in the overall number of publications in MEG. Ryusuke Kakigi emerged as the most prolific author, while Neuroimage led as the most prolific journal. Current hotspots in MEG research encompass resting state, networks, functional connectivity, phase dynamics, oscillation, and more. Future trends in MEG research are poised to advance across three key aspects: disease treatment and practical applications, experimental foundations and technical advancements, and fundamental and advanced human cognition.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Our study focuses on characterizing the highly ionized gas within the Milky Way's (MW) Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) that gives rise to ionic transitions in the X-ray band 2 - 25 \AA. Utilizing stacked \Chandra/\ACISS\ \MEG\ and \LETG\ spectra toward QSO sightlines, we employ the self-consistent hybrid ionization code PHASE to model our data. The stacked spectra are optimally described by three distinct gas phase components: a \warm\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 5.5), \warmhot\ (\logT\ $\sim 6$), and \hot\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 7.5) components. These findings confirm the presence of the \hot\ component in the MW's CGM indicating its coexistence with a \warm\ and a \warmhot\ gas phases. We find this \hot\ component to be homogeneous in temperature but inhomogeneous in column density. The gas in the \hot\ component requires over-abundances relative to solar to be consistent with the Dispersion Measure (DM) from the Galactic halo reported in the literature. {For the hot phase we estimated a DM = $55.1^{+29.9}_{-23.7}$ pc cm$^{-3}$}. We conclude that this phase is either enriched in Oxygen, Silicon, and Sulfur, or has metallicity {over 6} times solar value, or a combination of both. We do not detect Fe L-shell absorption lines, implying O/Fe $\geq$ 4. The non-solar abundance ratios found in the super-virial gas component in the Galactic halo suggest that this phase arises from Galactic feedback.</td>

Some of the generalizations such as generalized CW and next-to-nearest neighbour interaction CW have already been explored by a few authors. In this study, we studied non-local CW for the fermionic case and found that non-local models relax the $\left| q \right| > 1$ constraint to produce localization of the zero mode. We also made a comparison among them and have shown that for some parameter ranges, non-local variants of CW are more efficient than ordinary CW in generating the hierarchy required for the $\nu$ mass scale. Finally, phenomenological constraints from $BR(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )$ FCNC process and Higgs decay width have been imposed on the parameter space in non-local and both-sided clockwork models. We have listed benchmark points which are surviving current experimental bounds from MEG and are within the reach of the upcoming MEG-II experiment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) visualises microvasculature beyond the ultrasound diffraction limit (wavelength($\lambda$)/2) by localising and tracking spatially isolated microbubble contrast agents. SRUS phantoms typically consist of simple tube structures, where diameter channels below 100 $\mu$m are not available. Furthermore, these phantoms are generally fragile and unstable, have limited ground truth validation, and their simple structure limits the evaluation of SRUS algorithms. To aid SRUS development, robust and durable phantoms with known and physiologically relevant microvasculature are needed for repeatable SRUS testing. This work proposes a method to fabricate durable microvascular phantoms that allow optical gauging for SRUS validation. The methodology used a microvasculature negative print embedded in a Polydimethylsiloxane to fabricate a microvascular phantom. Branching microvascular phantoms with variable microvascular density were demonstrated with optically validated vessel diameters down to $\sim$ 60 $\mu$m ($\lambda$/5.8; $\lambda$ =$\sim$ 350 $\mu$m). SRUS imaging was performed and validated with optical measurements. The average SRUS error was 15.61 $\mu$m ($\lambda$/22) with a standard deviation error of 11.44 $\mu$m. The average error decreased to 7.93 $\mu$m ($\lambda$/44) once the number of localised microbubbles surpassed 1000 per estimated diameter. In addition, the less than 10$\%$ variance of acoustic and optical properties and the mechanical toughness of the phantoms measured a year after fabrication demonstrated their long-term durability. This work presents a method to fabricate durable and optically validated complex microvascular phantoms which can be used to quantify SRUS performance and facilitate its further development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising, aiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices, like low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain the ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus jointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have little computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing a novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to search for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures outperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and classification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our approach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like medical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.</td>

The dataset consists of 10,000 artificial patient records containing tabular variables (like symptoms, diagnoses and underlying conditions) and related notes describing the fictional patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases. The tabular portion of the data is generated through a Bayesian network, where both the causal structure between the variables and the conditional probabilities are proposed by an expert based on domain knowledge. We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In prediction tasks with multi-class outcomes, identifying covariates specifically associated with one or more outcome classes can be important. Conventional variable importance measures (VIMs) from random forests (RFs), like permutation and Gini importance, focus on overall predictive performance or node purity, without differentiating between the classes. Therefore, they can be expected to fail to distinguish class-associated covariates from covariates that only distinguish between groups of classes. We introduce a VIM called multi-class VIM, tailored for identifying exclusively class-associated covariates, via a novel RF variant called multi forests (MuFs). The trees in MuFs use both multi-way and binary splitting. The multi-way splits generate child nodes for each class, using a split criterion that evaluates how well these nodes represent their respective classes. This setup forms the basis of the multi-class VIM, which measures the discriminatory ability of the splits performed in the respective covariates with regard to this split criterion. Alongside the multi-class VIM, we introduce a second VIM, the discriminatory VIM. This measure, based on the binary splits, assesses the strength of the general influence of the covariates, irrespective of their class-associatedness. Simulation studies demonstrate that the multi-class VIM specifically ranks class-associated covariates highly, unlike conventional VIMs which also rank other types of covariates highly. Analyses of 121 datasets reveal that MuFs often have slightly lower predictive performance compared to conventional RFs. This is, however, not a limiting factor given the algorithm's primary purpose of calculating the multi-class VIM.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks are widely used in various segmentation tasks in medical images. However, they are challenged to learn global features adaptively due to the inherent locality of convolutional operations. In contrast, MLP Mixers are proposed as a backbone to learn global information across channels with low complexity. However, they cannot capture spatial features efficiently. Additionally, they lack effective mechanisms to fuse and mix features adaptively. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Decomposed Mixer module. It is designed to employ novel Mixers to extract features and aggregate information across different spatial locations and channels. Additionally, it employs novel dynamic mixing mechanisms to model inter-dependencies between channel and spatial feature representations and to fuse them adaptively. Subsequently, we incorporate it into a U-shaped Transformer-based architecture to generate a novel network, termed the Dynamic Decomposed MLP Mixer. We evaluated it for medical image segmentation on two datasets, and it achieved superior segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art methods.</td>

X-ray scanners have low radiation exposure, but their resolutions are low. This paper proposes a new conditional diffusion model, DX2CT, that reconstructs three-dimensional (3D) CT volumes from bi or mono-planar X-ray image(s). Proposed DX2CT consists of two key components: 1) modulating feature maps extracted from two-dimensional (2D) X-ray(s) with 3D positions of CT volume using a new transformer and 2) effectively using the modulated 3D position-aware feature maps as conditions of DX2CT. In particular, the proposed transformer can provide conditions with rich information of a target CT slice to the conditional diffusion model, enabling high-quality CT reconstruction. Our experiments with the bi or mono-planar X-ray(s) benchmark datasets show that proposed DX2CT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

Quantitative medical imaging data refer to numerical representations derived from medical imaging technologies, such as radiology and pathology imaging, that can be used to assess and quantify characteristics of diseases, especially cancer. The use of such data in both clinical and research setting enables precise quantifications and analyses of tumor characteristics that can facilitate objective evaluation of disease progression, response to therapy, and prognosis. The scale and size of these imaging biomarkers is vast and presents several analytical and computational challenges that range from high-dimensionality to complex structural correlation patterns.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), are essential for clinical applications. However, the need for diverse and comprehensive representations is particularly pronounced when considering the variability across different organs, diagnostic tasks, and imaging modalities. How to effectively interpret the intricate contextual information and extract meaningful insights from these images remains an open challenge to the community. While current self-supervised learning methods have shown potential, they often consider an image as a whole thereby overlooking the extensive, complex relationships among local regions from one or multiple images. In this work, we introduce a pioneering method for learning 3D medical image representations through an autoregressive pre-training framework. Our approach sequences various 3D medical images based on spatial, contrast, and semantic correlations, treating them as interconnected visual tokens within a token sequence. By employing an autoregressive sequence modeling task, we predict the next visual token in the sequence, which allows our model to deeply understand and integrate the contextual information inherent in 3D medical images. Additionally, we implement a random startup strategy to avoid overestimating token relationships and to enhance the robustness of learning. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the superior performance over others on nine downstream tasks in public datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the spectrometer is a fundamental component of MRI systems, responsible for the transmission of radiofrequency (RF) pulses that excite hydrogen nuclei and the subsequent acquisition of MR signals for processing. However, detailed knowledge about this component remains largely inaccessible due to the proprietary nature of commercial systems. To address this gap, we present an FPGA-based platform specifically designed for MRI signal transmission and reception in low-field MRI applications. Additionally, with appropriate chip replacements, this platform can be adapted for use in mid- and high-field MRI systems. This platform leverages Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technology to generate RF pulses, offering the flexibility to quickly and precisely adjust soft pulse parameters to meet the specific requirements of the MRI system. Additionally, the platform processes MRI signals through digital downconversion techniques and utilizes CIC and FIR filters to obtain baseband signals. Experimental testing of this platform has yielded promising results. We hope that this work will inspire further research and development in the field of MRI spectrometer design. Furthermore, it is worth noting that with the replacement of relevant chips, this system can also be adapted for use in mid- and high-field MRI systems.</td>
