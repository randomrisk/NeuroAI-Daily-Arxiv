<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding visual-semantic information from brain signals, such as functional MRI (fMRI), across different subjects poses significant challenges, including low signal-to-noise ratio, limited data availability, and cross-subject variability. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) show remarkable effectiveness in processing multimodal information. In this study, we introduce an LLM-based approach for reconstructing visual-semantic information from fMRI signals elicited by video stimuli. Specifically, we employ fine-tuning techniques on an fMRI encoder equipped with adaptors to transform brain responses into latent representations aligned with the video stimuli. Subsequently, these representations are mapped to textual modality by LLM. In particular, we integrate self-supervised domain adaptation methods to enhance the alignment between visual-semantic information and brain responses. Our proposed method achieves good results using various quantitative semantic metrics, while yielding similarity with ground-truth information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The current scenario of IoT is witnessing a constant increase on the volume of data, which is generated in constant stream, calling for novel architectural and logical solutions for processing it. Moving the data handling towards the edge of the computing spectrum guarantees better distribution of load and, in principle, lower latency and better privacy. However, managing such a structure is complex, especially when requirements, also referred to Service Level Objectives (SLOs), specified by applications' owners and infrastructure managers need to be ensured. Despite the rich number of proposals of Machine Learning (ML) based management solutions, researchers and practitioners yet struggle to guarantee long-term prediction and control, and accurate troubleshooting. Therefore, we present a novel ML paradigm based on Active Inference (AIF) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implement it and evaluate it in a heterogeneous real stream processing use case, where an AIF-based agent continuously optimizes the fulfillment of three SLOs for three autonomous driving services running on multiple devices. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. Through this approach, our agent requires up to thirty iterations to converge to the optimal solution, showing the capability of offering accurate results in a short amount of time. Furthermore, thanks to AIF and its causal structures, our method guarantees full transparency on the decision making, making the interpretation of the results and the troubleshooting effortless.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) data provides a non-invasive method for researchers and clinicians to observe brain activity in real time. The integration of deep learning techniques with EEG data has significantly improved the ability to identify meaningful patterns, leading to valuable insights for both clinical and research purposes. However, most of the frameworks so far, designed for EEG data analysis, are either too focused on pre-processing or in deep learning methods per, making their use for both clinician and developer communities problematic. Moreover, critical issues such as ethical considerations, biases, uncertainties, and the limitations inherent in AI models for EEG data analysis are frequently overlooked, posing challenges to the responsible implementation of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive deep learning framework tailored for EEG data processing, model training and report generation. While constructed in way to be adapted and developed further by AI developers, it enables to report, through model cards, the outcome and specific information of use for both developers and clinicians. In this way, we discuss how this framework can, in the future, provide clinical researchers and developers with the tools needed to create transparent and accountable AI models for EEG data analysis and diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper is motivated by studies in neuroscience experiments to understand interactions between nodes in a brain network using different types of data modalities that capture different distinct facets of brain activity. To assess Granger-causality, we introduce a flexible framework through a general class of models that accommodates mixed types of data (binary, count, continuous, and positive components) formulated in a generalized linear model (GLM) fashion. Statistical inference for causality is performed based on both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, with a focus on the latter. Here, we develop a procedure for conducting inference through the proposed Bayesian mixed time series model. By introducing spike and slab priors for some parameters in the model, our inferential approach guides causality order selection and provides proper uncertainty quantification. The proposed methods are then utilized to study the rat spike train and local field potentials (LFP) data recorded during the olfaction working memory task. The proposed methodology provides critical insights into the causal relationship between the rat spiking activity and LFP spectral power. Specifically, power in the LFP beta band is predictive of spiking activity 300 milliseconds later, providing a novel analytical tool for this area of emerging interest in neuroscience and demonstrating its usefulness and flexibility in the study of causality in general.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper provides a perspective on applying the concepts of information thermodynamics, developed recently in non-equilibrium statistical physics, to problems in theoretical neuroscience. Historically, information and energy in neuroscience have been treated separately, in contrast to physics approaches, where the relationship of entropy production with heat is a central idea. It is argued here that also in neural systems information and energy can be considered within the same theoretical framework. Starting from basic ideas of thermodynamics and information theory on a classic Brownian particle, it is shown how noisy neural networks can infer its probabilistic motion. The decoding of the particle motion by neurons is performed with some accuracy and it has some energy cost, and both can be determined using information thermodynamics. In a similar fashion, we also discuss how neural networks in the brain can learn the particle velocity, and maintain that information in the weights of plastic synapses from a physical point of view. Generally, it is shown how the framework of stochastic and information thermodynamics can be used practically to study neural inference, learning, and information storing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Although developed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) registration algorithms based on deep learning have achieved a certain degree of alignment of functional area, they underutilized fine structural information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) registration model that integrates both structural and functional MRI information. The model first learns to generate deformation fields by inputting structural MRI (T1w-MRI) into the CNN to capture fine structural information. Then, we construct a local functional connectivity pattern to describe the local fMRI information, and use the Bhattacharyya coefficient to measure the similarity between two fMRI images, which is used as a loss function to facilitate the alignment of functional areas. In the inter-subject registration experiment, our model achieved an average number of voxels exceeding the threshold of 4.24 is 2248 in the group-level t-test maps for the four functional brain networks (default mode network, visual network, central executive network, and sensorimotor network). Additionally, the atlas-based registration experiment results show that the average number of voxels exceeding this threshold is 3620. The results are the largest among all methods. Our model achieves an excellent registration performance in fMRI and improves the consistency of functional regions. The proposed model has the potential to optimize fMRI image processing and analysis, facilitating the development of fMRI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.</td>

In experiments, this is often achieved using stimulus-response paradigms where the motor augmentation can be optimally timed. However, in the everyday world users primarily act at their own volition. We designed a closed-loop system for motor augmentation using an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to cue users' volitional finger tapping. Relying on the readiness potentials, the system autonomously cued the finger movement at the time of the intent to interact via electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The prototype discriminated pre-movement from idle EEG segments with an average F1 score of 0.7. However, we found only weak evidence for a maintained SoA. Still, participants reported a higher level of control when working with the system instead of being passively moved.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Dementia poses a growing challenge in our aging society. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are the leading causes of early-onset dementia. FTD and AD display unique traits in their onset, progression, and treatment responses. In particular, FTD often faces a prolonged diagnostic process and is commonly misdiagnosed with AD due to overlapping symptoms. This study utilizes a complex network model of brain electrical activity using resting-state EEG recordings to address the misdiagnosis. It compares the network organization between AD and FTD, highlighting connectivity differences and examining the significance of EEG signals across frequency bands in distinguishing AD and FTD. The publicly available EEG dataset of 36 AD and 23 FTD patients is utilized for analyses. Cross-plot transition entropy (CPTE) is employed to measure synchronization between EEG signals and construct connection matrices. CPTE offers advantages in parameter setting, computational efficiency, and robustness. The analysis reveals significantly different clustering coefficients (CC), subgraph centrality (SC), and eigenvector centrality (EC) between the two groups. FTD shows higher connectivity, particularly in delta, theta, and gamma bands, owing to lower neurodegeneration. The CPTE-based network parameters effectively classify the two groups with an accuracy of 87.58\%, with the gamma band demonstrating the highest accuracy of 92.87%. Consequently, CPTE-based, complex network analysis of EEG data from AD and FTD patients reveals significant differences in brain network organization. The approach shows potential for identifying unique characteristics and providing insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes of the various forms of dementia, thereby assisting in accurate diagnosis and treatment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Advancements in non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology have enabled communication through brain activity, offering significant potential for individuals with motor impairments. Existing methods for decoding characters or words from EEG recordings either rely on continuous external stimulation for high decoding accuracy or depend on direct intention imagination, which suffers from reduced discrimination ability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Virtual content in Augmented Reality (AR) applications can be constructed according to the designer's requirements, but real environments, are difficult to be accurate control or completely reproduce. This makes it difficult to prototype AR applications for certain real environments. One way to address this issue is to use Virtual Reality (VR) to simulate an AR system, enabling the design of controlled experiments and conducting usability evaluations. However, the effectiveness of using VR to simulate AR has not been well studied. In this paper, we report on a user study (N=20) conducted to investigate the impact of using an VR simulation of AR on participants' task performance and cognitive workload (CWL). Participants performed several office tasks in an AR scene with virtual monitors and then again in the VR-simulated AR scene. While using the interfaces CWL was measured with Electroencephalography (EEG) data and a subjective questionnaire. Results showed that frequent visual checks on the keyboard resulted in decreased task performance and increased cognitive workload. This study found that using AR centered on virtual monitor can be effectively simulated using VR. However, there is more research that can be done, so we also report on the study limitations and directions for future work.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition has gained significant traction due to its accuracy and objectivity. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals leads to distribution drift over time, causing severe performance degradation when the model is reused. While numerous domain adaptation (DA) approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this issue, their reliance on large amounts of target data for calibration restricts them to offline scenarios, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Evolvable Fast Adaptation (EvoFA), an online adaptive framework tailored for EEG data. EvoFA organically integrates the rapid adaptation of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and the distribution matching of Domain Adaptation (DA) through a two-stage generalization process. During the training phase, a robust base meta-learning model is constructed for strong generalization. In the testing phase, a designed evolvable meta-adaptation module iteratively aligns the marginal distribution of target (testing) data with the evolving source (training) data within a model-agnostic meta-learning framework, enabling the model to learn the evolving trends of testing data relative to training data and improving online testing performance. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoFA achieves significant improvements compared to the basic FSL method and previous online methods. The introduction of EvoFA paves the way for broader adoption of EEG-based emotion recognition in real-world applications. Our code will be released upon publication.</td>

For conventional artifact removal methods, the EMD technique is commonly employed. However, the challenge lies in accurately interpolating the missing components of the signal while preserving its inherent frequency components. To overcome this limitation, we incorporated machine learning technique, which enables us to carefully handle the interpolation process without directly manipulating the data. The key advantage of our approach lies in the preservation of the natural characteristics of the EEG signal during artifact removal. By utilizing machine learning for interpolation, we ensure that the average component obtained through the EMD method retains the crucial frequency components of the original signal. This preservation is essential for maintaining the integrity and fidelity of the EEG data, allowing for accurate analysis and interpretation. The results obtained from our evaluation serve to validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for further advancements in EEG signal processing and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Can we directly visualize what we imagine in our brain together with what we describe? The inherent nature of human perception reveals that, when we think, our body can combine language description and build a vivid picture in our brain. Intuitively, generative models should also hold such versatility. In this paper, we introduce BrainDreamer, a novel end-to-end language-guided generative framework that can mimic human reasoning and generate high-quality images from electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals. Our method is superior in its capacity to eliminate the noise introduced by non-invasive EEG data acquisition and meanwhile achieve a more precise mapping between the EEG and image modality, thus leading to significantly better-generated images. Specifically, BrainDreamer consists of two key learning stages: 1) modality alignment and 2) image generation. In the alignment stage, we propose a novel mask-based triple contrastive learning strategy to effectively align EEG, text, and image embeddings to learn a unified representation. In the generation stage, we inject the EEG embeddings into the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model by designing a learnable EEG adapter to generate high-quality reasoning-coherent images. Moreover, BrainDreamer can accept textual descriptions (e.g., color, position, etc.) to achieve controllable image generation. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior arts in terms of generating quality and quantitative performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recently, multimodal electroencephalogram (EEG) learning has shown great promise in disease detection. At the same time, ensuring privacy in clinical studies has become increasingly crucial due to legal and ethical concerns. One widely adopted scheme for privacy protection is differential privacy (DP) because of its clear interpretation and ease of implementation. Although numerous methods have been proposed under DP, it has not been extensively studied for multimodal EEG data due to the complexities of models and signal data considered there. In this paper, we propose a novel Differentially Private Multimodal Laplacian Dropout (DP-MLD) scheme for multimodal EEG learning. Our approach proposes a novel multimodal representative learning model that processes EEG data by language models as text and other modal data by vision transformers as images, incorporating well-designed cross-attention mechanisms to effectively extract and integrate cross-modal features. To achieve DP, we design a novel adaptive feature-level Laplacian dropout scheme, where randomness allocation and performance are dynamically optimized within given privacy budgets. In the experiment on an open-source multimodal dataset of Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson's Disease (PD), our proposed method demonstrates an approximate 4\% improvement in classification accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal EEG learning under DP.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Designs for implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have increased significantly in recent years. Each device promises better clinical outcomes and quality-of-life improvements, yet due to severe and inflexible safety constraints, progress requires tight co-design from materials to circuits and all the way up the stack to applications and algorithms. This trend has become more aggressive over time, forcing clinicians and patients to rely on vendor-specific hardware and software for deployment, maintenance, upgrades, and replacement. This over-reliance is ethically problematic, especially if companies go out-of-business or business objectives diverge from clinical promises. Device heterogeneity additionally burdens clinicians and healthcare facilities, adding complexity and costs for in-clinic visits, monitoring, and continuous access.   Reliability, interoperability, portability, and future-proofed design is needed, but this unfortunately comes at a cost. These system features sap resources that would have otherwise been allocated to reduce power/energy and improve performance. Navigating this trade-off in a systematic way is critical to providing patients with forever access to their implants and reducing burdens placed on healthcare providers and caretakers. We study the integration of on-device storage to highlight the sensitivity of this trade-off and establish other points of interest within BCI design that require careful investigation. In the process, we revisit relevant problems in computer architecture and medical devices from the current era of hardware specialization and modern neurotechnology.</td>

In experiments, this is often achieved using stimulus-response paradigms where the motor augmentation can be optimally timed. However, in the everyday world users primarily act at their own volition. We designed a closed-loop system for motor augmentation using an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to cue users' volitional finger tapping. Relying on the readiness potentials, the system autonomously cued the finger movement at the time of the intent to interact via electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The prototype discriminated pre-movement from idle EEG segments with an average F1 score of 0.7. However, we found only weak evidence for a maintained SoA. Still, participants reported a higher level of control when working with the system instead of being passively moved.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Advancements in non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology have enabled communication through brain activity, offering significant potential for individuals with motor impairments. Existing methods for decoding characters or words from EEG recordings either rely on continuous external stimulation for high decoding accuracy or depend on direct intention imagination, which suffers from reduced discrimination ability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals for emotion recognition is a significant advancement in understanding human emotions. However, due to the lack of artificial intelligence data and algorithms in this field, current research faces the following challenges: 1) The portable wearable devices have higher requirements for lightweight models; 2) The objective differences of physiology and psychology among different subjects aggravate the difficulty of emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-subject fNIRS emotion recognition method, called the Online Multi-level Contrastive Representation Distillation framework (OMCRD). Specifically, OMCRD is a framework designed for mutual learning among multiple lightweight student networks. It utilizes multi-level fNIRS feature extractor for each sub-network and conducts multi-view sentimental mining using physiological signals. The proposed Inter-Subject Interaction Contrastive Representation (IS-ICR) facilitates knowledge transfer for interactions between student models, enhancing cross-subject emotion recognition performance. The optimal student network can be selected and deployed on a wearable device. Some experimental results demonstrate that OMCRD achieves state-of-the-art results in emotional perception and affective imagery tasks.</td>

Accurate EEG source localization is crucial for applications in cognitive neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To make significant progress toward precise source orientation detection and improved signal reconstruction, we introduce the Accelerated Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (ALCMV) beamforming toolbox and the Accelerated Brain Source Orientation Detection (AORI) toolbox. The ALCMV algorithm speeds up EEG source reconstruction by utilizing recursive covariance matrix calculations, while AORI simplifies source orientation detection from three dimensions to one, reducing computational load by 66% compared to conventional methods. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we demonstrate that these algorithms maintain high accuracy, with orientation errors below 0.2% and signal reconstruction accuracy within 2%. These findings suggest that the proposed toolboxes represent a substantial advancement in the efficiency and speed of EEG source localization, making them well-suited for real-time neurotechnological applications.</td>

To address these limitations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Mamba Network (STMambaNet), an innovative model leveraging the Mamba state space architecture, which excels in processing extended sequences with linear scalability. By incorporating spatial and temporal Mamba encoders, STMambaNet effectively captures the intricate dynamics in both space and time, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of EEG signals for MI classification. Experimental results on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate STMambaNet's superiority over existing models, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing MI-based BCIs and improving real-world BCI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding neurophysiological signals into language is of great research interest within brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Electroencephalography (EEG), known for its non-invasiveness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness, has been a popular method in this field. However, current EEG-to-Text decoding approaches face challenges due to the huge domain gap between EEG recordings and raw texts, inherent data bias, and small closed vocabularies. In this paper, we propose SEE: Semantically Aligned EEG-to-Text Translation, a novel method aimed at improving EEG-to-Text decoding by seamlessly integrating two modules into a pre-trained BART language model. These two modules include (1) a Cross-Modal Codebook that learns cross-modal representations to enhance feature consolidation and mitigate domain gap, and (2) a Semantic Matching Module that fully utilizes pre-trained text representations to align multi-modal features extracted from EEG-Text pairs while considering noise caused by false negatives, i.e., data from different EEG-Text pairs that have similar semantic meanings. Experimental results on the Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo) demonstrate the effectiveness of SEE, which enhances the feasibility of accurate EEG-to-Text decoding.</td>

Tackling this problem demands advanced algorithms, extensive noisy-clean training data, and thorough evaluation strategies. This study presents the Artifact Removal Transformer (ART), an innovative EEG denoising model employing transformer architecture to adeptly capture the transient millisecond-scale dynamics characteristic of EEG signals. Our approach offers a holistic, end-to-end denoising solution for diverse artifact types in multichannel EEG data. We enhanced the generation of noisy-clean EEG data pairs using an independent component analysis, thus fortifying the training scenarios critical for effective supervised learning. We performed comprehensive validations using a wide range of open datasets from various BCI applications, employing metrics like mean squared error and signal-to-noise ratio, as well as sophisticated techniques such as source localization and EEG component classification. Our evaluations confirm that ART surpasses other deep-learning-based artifact removal methods, setting a new benchmark in EEG signal processing.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have significantly impacted motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, enhancing the decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, most studies struggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks, limiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a novel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by utilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask learning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the spectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture is used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit different generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To address this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously regulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task based on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six benchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent and -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification results show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering promising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.</td>

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) registration model that integrates both structural and functional MRI information. The model first learns to generate deformation fields by inputting structural MRI (T1w-MRI) into the CNN to capture fine structural information. Then, we construct a local functional connectivity pattern to describe the local fMRI information, and use the Bhattacharyya coefficient to measure the similarity between two fMRI images, which is used as a loss function to facilitate the alignment of functional areas. In the inter-subject registration experiment, our model achieved an average number of voxels exceeding the threshold of 4.24 is 2248 in the group-level t-test maps for the four functional brain networks (default mode network, visual network, central executive network, and sensorimotor network). Additionally, the atlas-based registration experiment results show that the average number of voxels exceeding this threshold is 3620. The results are the largest among all methods. Our model achieves an excellent registration performance in fMRI and improves the consistency of functional regions. The proposed model has the potential to optimize fMRI image processing and analysis, facilitating the development of fMRI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many fMRI analyses examine functional connectivity, or statistical dependencies among remote brain regions. Yet popular methods for studying whole-brain functional connectivity often yield results that are difficult to interpret. Factor analysis offers a natural framework in which to study such dependencies, particularly given its emphasis on interpretability. However, multivariate factor models break down when applied to functional and spatiotemporal data, like fMRI. We present a factor model for discretely-observed multidimensional functional data that is well-suited to the study of functional connectivity. Unlike classical factor models which decompose a multivariate observation into a "common" term that captures covariance between observed variables and an uncorrelated "idiosyncratic" term that captures variance unique to each observed variable, our model decomposes a functional observation into two uncorrelated components: a "global" term that captures long-range dependencies and a "local" term that captures short-range dependencies. We show that if the global covariance is smooth with finite rank and the local covariance is banded with potentially infinite rank, then this decomposition is identifiable. Under these conditions, recovery of the global covariance amounts to rank-constrained matrix completion, which we exploit to formulate consistent loading estimators. We study these estimators, and their more interpretable post-processed counterparts, through simulations, then use our approach to uncover a rich covariance structure in a collection of resting-state fMRI scans.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that encompasses a wide variety of symptoms and degrees of impairment, which makes the diagnosis and treatment challenging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively used to study brain activity in ASD, and machine learning methods have been applied to analyze resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. However, fewer studies have explored the recent transformer-based models on rs-fMRI data. Given the superiority of transformer models in capturing long-range dependencies in sequence data, we have developed a transformer-based self-supervised framework that directly analyzes time-series fMRI data without computing functional connectivity. To address over-fitting in small datasets and enhance the model performance, we propose self-supervised pre-training tasks to reconstruct the randomly masked fMRI time-series data, investigating the effects of various masking strategies. We then finetune the model for the ASD classification task and evaluate it using two public datasets and five-fold cross-validation with different amounts of training data. The experiments show that randomly masking entire ROIs gives better model performance than randomly masking time points in the pre-training step, resulting in an average improvement of 10.8% for AUC and 9.3% for subject accuracy compared with the transformer model trained from scratch across different levels of training data availability.

Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets. Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances. Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance, and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces the Neural Transcoding Vision Transformer (\modelname), a generative model designed to estimate high-resolution functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) samples from simultaneous Electroencephalography (EEG) data. A key feature of \modelname is its Domain Matching (DM) sub-module which effectively aligns the latent EEG representations with those of fMRI volumes, enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability. Unlike previous methods that tend to struggle with fidelity and reproducibility of images, \modelname addresses these challenges by ensuring methodological integrity and higher-quality reconstructions which we showcase through extensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets; \modelname outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin in both cases, e.g. achieving a $10\times$ reduction in RMSE and a $3.14\times$ increase in SSIM on the Oddball dataset. An ablation study also provides insights into the contribution of each component to the model's overall effectiveness. This development is critical in offering a new approach to lessen the time and financial constraints typically linked with high-resolution brain imaging, thereby aiding in the swift and precise diagnosis of neurological disorders. Although it is not a replacement for actual fMRI but rather a step towards making such imaging more accessible, we believe that it represents a pivotal advancement in clinical practice and neuroscience research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An unprecedented amount of existing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data provides a new opportunity to understand the relationship between functional fluctuation and human cognition/behavior using a data-driven approach. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made in machine learning to predict cognitive states from evolving volumetric images of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Due to the complex nature of brain function, however, the evaluation on learning performance and discoveries are not often consistent across current state-of-the-arts (SOTA). By capitalizing on large-scale existing neuroimaging data (34,887 data samples from six public databases), we seek to establish a well-founded empirical guideline for designing deep models for functional neuroimages by linking the methodology underpinning with knowledge from the neuroscience domain. Specifically, we put the spotlight on (1) What is the current SOTA performance in cognitive task recognition and disease diagnosis using fMRI? (2) What are the limitations of current deep models? and (3) What is the general guideline for selecting the suitable machine learning backbone for new neuroimaging applications? We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation and statistical analysis, in various settings, to answer the above outstanding questions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing 3D visuals from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, introduced as Recon3DMind in our conference work, is of significant interest to both cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. To advance this task, we present the fMRI-3D dataset, which includes data from 15 participants and showcases a total of 4768 3D objects. The dataset comprises two components: fMRI-Shape, previously introduced and accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Shape, and fMRI-Objaverse, proposed in this paper and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Objaverse. fMRI-Objaverse includes data from 5 subjects, 4 of whom are also part of the Core set in fMRI-Shape, with each subject viewing 3142 3D objects across 117 categories, all accompanied by text captions. This significantly enhances the diversity and potential applications of the dataset. Additionally, we propose MinD-3D, a novel framework designed to decode 3D visual information from fMRI signals. The framework first extracts and aggregates features from fMRI data using a neuro-fusion encoder, then employs a feature-bridge diffusion model to generate visual features, and finally reconstructs the 3D object using a generative transformer decoder. We establish new benchmarks by designing metrics at both semantic and structural levels to evaluate model performance. Furthermore, we assess our model's effectiveness in an Out-of-Distribution setting and analyze the attribution of the extracted features and the visual ROIs in fMRI signals. Our experiments demonstrate that MinD-3D not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic and spatial accuracy but also deepens our understanding of how human brain processes 3D visual information.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding neurological disorder is a fundamental problem in neuroscience, which often requires the analysis of brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to brain networks faces challenges. Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer. It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism. A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency. Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification. Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience. This paper provides a solution for analyzing brain networks, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/AngusMonroe/Contrasformer}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the morphology of galaxies is a critical aspect of astrophysics research, providing insight into the formation, evolution, and physical properties of these vast cosmic structures. Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\sim200$ for 2D images and $\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Abnormality detection in the identification of a single-subject which deviates from the majority of the dataset that comes from a control group is a critical problem. A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mobile edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence~(GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>MEG are non invasive neuroimaging techniques with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, crucial for studying brain function in dementia and Alzheimer Disease. They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) shows promise in medical image analysis but requires substantial data and computational resources. Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities under-explored. Here, we propose the first adaptation of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and data imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised pretraining (SSP) has shown promising results in learning from large unlabeled datasets and, thus, could be useful for automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) short-axis cine segmentation. However, inconsistent reports of the benefits of SSP for segmentation have made it difficult to apply SSP to CMR. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate SSP methods for CMR cine segmentation.   To this end, short-axis cine stacks of 296 subjects (90618 2D slices) were used for unlabeled pretraining with four SSP methods; SimCLR, positional contrastive learning, DINO, and masked image modeling (MIM). Subsets of varying numbers of subjects were used for supervised fine-tuning of 2D models for each SSP method, as well as to train a 2D baseline model from scratch. The fine-tuned models were compared to the baseline using the 3D Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in a test dataset of 140 subjects.   The SSP methods showed no performance gains with the largest supervised fine-tuning subset compared to the baseline (DSC = 0.89). When only 10 subjects (231 2D slices) are available for supervised training, SSP using MIM (DSC = 0.86) improves over training from scratch (DSC = 0.82).   This study found that SSP is valuable for CMR cine segmentation when labeled training data is scarce, but does not aid state-of-the-art deep learning methods when ample labeled data is available. Moreover, the choice of SSP method is important. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/q-cardIA/ssp-cmr-cine-segmentation</td>

The integration of deep learning techniques with EEG data has significantly improved the ability to identify meaningful patterns, leading to valuable insights for both clinical and research purposes. However, most of the frameworks so far, designed for EEG data analysis, are either too focused on pre-processing or in deep learning methods per, making their use for both clinician and developer communities problematic. Moreover, critical issues such as ethical considerations, biases, uncertainties, and the limitations inherent in AI models for EEG data analysis are frequently overlooked, posing challenges to the responsible implementation of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive deep learning framework tailored for EEG data processing, model training and report generation. While constructed in way to be adapted and developed further by AI developers, it enables to report, through model cards, the outcome and specific information of use for both developers and clinicians. In this way, we discuss how this framework can, in the future, provide clinical researchers and developers with the tools needed to create transparent and accountable AI models for EEG data analysis and diagnosis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Ophthalmic diseases represent a significant global health issue, necessitating the use of advanced precise diagnostic tools. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imagery which offers high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina has become a pivotal imaging modality in ophthalmology. Traditionally physicians have manually detected various diseases and biomarkers from such diagnostic imagery. In recent times, deep learning techniques have been extensively used for medical diagnostic tasks enabling fast and precise diagnosis. This paper presents a novel approach for ophthalmic biomarker detection using an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer. While CNNs are good for feature extraction within the local context of the image, transformers are known for their ability to extract features from the global context of the image. Using an ensemble of both techniques allows us to harness the best of both worlds. Our method has been implemented on the OLIVES dataset to detect 6 major biomarkers from the OCT images and shows significant improvement of the macro averaged F1 score on the dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting hospital length of stay (LoS) stands as a critical factor in shaping public health strategies. This data serves as a cornerstone for governments to discern trends, patterns, and avenues for enhancing healthcare delivery. In this study, we introduce a robust hybrid deep learning model, a combination of Multi-layer Convolutional (CNNs) deep learning, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Dense neural networks, that outperforms 11 conventional and state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies in accurately forecasting inpatient hospital stay duration. Our investigation delves into the implementation of this hybrid model, scrutinising variables like geographic indicators tied to caregiving institutions, demographic markers encompassing patient ethnicity, race, and age, as well as medical attributes such as the CCS diagnosis code, APR DRG code, illness severity metrics, and hospital stay duration. Statistical evaluations reveal the pinnacle LoS accuracy achieved by our proposed model (CNN-GRU-DNN), which averages at 89% across a 10-fold cross-validation test, surpassing LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 19%, 18.2%, 18.6%, and 7%, respectively. Accurate LoS predictions not only empower hospitals to optimise resource allocation and curb expenses associated with prolonged stays but also pave the way for novel strategies in hospital stay management. This avenue holds promise for catalysing advancements in healthcare research and innovation, inspiring a new era of precision-driven healthcare practices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: The integration of multi-stain histopathology images through deep learning poses a significant challenge in digital histopathology. Current multi-modal approaches struggle with data heterogeneity and missing data. This study aims to overcome these limitations by developing a novel transformer model for multi-stain integration that can handle missing data during training as well as inference. Methods: We propose UNICORN (UNiversal modality Integration Network for CORonary classificatioN) a multi-modal transformer capable of processing multi-stain histopathology for atherosclerosis severity class prediction. The architecture comprises a two-stage, end-to-end trainable model with specialized modules utilizing transformer self-attention blocks. The initial stage employs domain-specific expert modules to extract features from each modality. In the subsequent stage, an aggregation expert module integrates these features by learning the interactions between the different data modalities. Results: Evaluation was performed using a multi-class dataset of atherosclerotic lesions from the Munich Cardiovascular Studies Biobank (MISSION), using over 4,000 paired multi-stain whole slide images (WSIs) from 170 deceased individuals on 7 prespecified segments of the coronary tree, each stained according to four histopathological protocols. UNICORN achieved a classification accuracy of 0.67, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. The model effectively identifies relevant tissue phenotypes across stainings and implicitly models disease progression. Conclusion: Our proposed multi-modal transformer model addresses key challenges in medical data analysis, including data heterogeneity and missing modalities. Explainability and the model's effectiveness in predicting atherosclerosis progression underscores its potential for broader applications in medical research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical imaging is spearheading the AI transformation of healthcare. Performance reporting is key to determine which methods should be translated into clinical practice. Frequently, broad conclusions are simply derived from mean performance values. In this paper, we argue that this common practice is often a misleading simplification as it ignores performance variability. Our contribution is threefold. (1) Analyzing all MICCAI segmentation papers (n = 221) published in 2023, we first observe that more than 50\% of papers do not assess performance variability at all. Moreover, only one (0.5\%) paper reported confidence intervals (CIs) for model performance. (2) To address the reporting bottleneck, we show that the unreported standard deviation (SD) in segmentation papers can be approximated by a second-order polynomial function of the mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Based on external validation data from 56 previous MICCAI challenges, we demonstrate that this approximation can accurately reconstruct the CI of a method using information provided in publications. (3) Finally, we reconstructed 95\% CIs around the mean DSC of MICCAI 2023 segmentation papers. The median CI width was 0.03 which is three times larger than the median performance gap between the first and second ranked method. For more than 60\% of papers, the mean performance of the second-ranked method was within the CI of the first-ranked method. We conclude that current publications typically do not provide sufficient evidence to support which models could potentially be translated into clinical practice.</td>
