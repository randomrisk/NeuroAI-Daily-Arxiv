<td style='padding: 4px;'>Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+ SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to 17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices, bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Our understanding of neural systems rests on our ability to characterise how they perform distributed computation and integrate information. Advances in information theory have introduced several quantities to describe complex information structures, where collective patterns of coordination emerge from high-order (i.e. beyond-pairwise) interdependencies. Unfortunately, the use of these approaches to study large neural systems is severely hindered by the poor scalability of existing techniques. Moreover, there are relatively few measures specifically designed for multivariate time series data. Here we introduce a novel measure of information about macroscopic structures, termed M-information, which quantifies the high-order integration of information in complex dynamical systems. We show that M-information can be calculated via a convex optimisation problem, and we derive a robust and efficient algorithm that scales gracefully with system size. Our analyses show that M-information is resilient to noise, indexes critical behaviour in artificial neuronal populations, and reflects task performance in real-world mouse brain activity data. Furthermore, M-information can be incorporated into existing information decomposition frameworks to reveal a comprehensive taxonomy of information dynamics. Taken together, these results help us unravel collective computation in complex neural systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and Objective: Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which interference between electrical current fields extends the possibilities of electrical brain stimulation. The objective of this study is to develop an efficient mathematical tTIS forward modelling scheme that allows for realistic and adaptable simulation and can be updated accurately when the stimulation frequency is modified in one or more electrodes. Such a model is vital, for example, in optimization processes that seek the best possible stimulation currents to exhibit or inhibit a given brain region. This study aims to establish and evaluate the complete electrode model (CEM), i.e., a set of boundary conditions incorporating electrode impedance and contact patch, as a forward finite-element-method-based simulation technique for tTIS and investigate linearized CEM as a surrogate.   Results: The CEM-based forward simulation successfully reproduced the volumetric stimulating fields induced by tTIS. Sensitivity analysis showed that variations in electrode impedance substantially affect the field distribution, especially in regions where the interfering currents have nearly equal amplitudes. The linearized CEM model closely matched the full nonlinear model within a predefined peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) threshold for relative error. Both models exhibited the highest sensitivity near the focal region.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What fundamental research questions are essential for advancing toward brain-like AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capable of performing any intellectual task a human can? Should it be something like the Turing machine (1936), which answers the question "What is computation?" and lays the foundation for the entire field of computer science? Or should it be something like Shannon's mathematical theory of communication (1948), which answers the question "What is information?" and forms the basis for modern communication technology? We believe the key question today is the relationship between cognition and computation (RCC). For example, the widely discussed question "Will artificial intelligence replace the human mind?" is, in essence and in scientific terms, an issue concerning RCC. We have chosen to classify RCC into four categories: 1. The relationship between the primitives of cognition and the primitives of computation. 2. The relationship between the anatomical structure of neural representation of cognition and the computational architecture of artificial intelligence. 3. The relationship between emergents in cognition and emergents in computation. 4. The relationship between the mathematical foundations of cognition and computation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: MRI gradients with a conventional, bipolar design generally face a trade-off between performance, encoding ambiguity, and circumventing the latter by means of RF selectivity. This problem is particularly limiting in cutting-edge brain imaging performed at field strengths >= 7T and using high-performance head gradients. Methods: To address this issue, the present work proposes to fundamentally eliminate the encoding ambiguity in head gradients by using a unipolar z-gradient design that takes advantage of the signal-free range on one side of the imaging volume. This concept is demonstrated by implementation of a unipolar head gradient for operation at 7T. Results: Imaging in phantoms and in vivo demonstrates elimination of backfolding due to encoding ambiguity. At the same time, the unipolar design achieves efficiency on par with conventional bipolar design, resulting in high amplitude and slew-rate performance. Conclusion: The prospect of gradient systems based on a unipolar design holds promise for all advanced neuroimaging that demands high gradient performance. It will make the greatest difference at 7T and beyond where the absence of ambiguity removes a key concern and constraint in terms of RF behaviour and instrumentation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity, enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia. Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15 years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12 years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of -0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused information from different views and volumetric information to achieve state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially informative features and the ability to adapt treatment based on individual response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity. Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight, identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns, demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover, its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data, supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy strategies for both photon and particle therapies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However, current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically informed radiotherapy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reconstructing the attractors of complex nonlinear dynamical systems from available measurements is key to analyse and predict their time evolution. Existing attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological embedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from the actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often available only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and the time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of Homogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more faithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous Differentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their de-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with time-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We apply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of increasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and the Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG recordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain drastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as well as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of magnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the flexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that they can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and reconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical models and real data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are vital for epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Their unified analysis offers the potential to harness the complementary strengths of each modality but is challenging due to variations in recording montages, amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequency components. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces EpiNT, a novel Transformer-based pre-trained model for unified EEG and iEEG analysis. EpiNT employs channel-independent modeling with masked autoencoders (MAE) and vector quantization (VQ), along with a frequency domain mapping quantizer to capture crucial frequency features. Pre-trained on over 2,700 hours of multi-modal clinical neurophysiological data from 1,199 patients, EpiNT outperformed both randomly initialized models and other pre-trained methods on six downstream classification tasks, demonstrating robust representation learning capabilities.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article aims to explore the optimization of mental performance through the analysis of metrics associated with the psychological state known as flow. Several clinical studies have shown a correlation between the mental state of flow (characterized by deep and relaxed concentration and high psychophysical efficiency) and brain activity measured through electroencephalography (EEG). This study confirms such a correlation, focusing in particular on the sports field, where the flow state tends to occur more frequently. To conduct the study, Sporthype developed proprietary software that integrates several predictive models, in particular the Flow State Index (FSI), implemented within the Holytics system. An analytical protocol was established, including mental exercises and data collection sessions using the portable EEG device Muse, accompanied by a questionnaire to gather athletes' subjective perceptions of their mental state. The results revealed a significant alignment between the EEG data and the subjective experiences reported in the questionnaires, confirming the feasibility of detecting the flow state through prefrontal cortex activity. Furthermore, the psychological exercises included in the study protocol showed a tangible positive effect in enhancing flow during athletic performance. Flow improves performance through a more harmonious synchronization between mind and body. Although golf was the main context of the experimentation, the mathematical models developed within Holytics were designed to be applicable to a wide range of sports. In addition to golf, preliminary tests have been conducted in other sports such as tennis, as well as in non-sport contexts, including gaming and mental training practices such as mindfulness, concentration, and visualization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting its strong generalization ability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Auditory processing difficulties involve challenges in understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal hearing. However, the neural mechanisms remain unclear, and standardized diagnostic criteria are lacking. This study examined neural indicators using EEG under realistic noisy conditions. Ten Japanese-speaking university students participated in auditory tasks, including a resting state, a lecture attention task with background noise, and a task requiring attention to background noise. The study analyzed the peak frequency and power of alpha waves, the long-range temporal correlation of alpha oscillations, and the absolute power of delta waves. Results showed a significant reduction in the power of alpha waves during the background noise attention task, suggesting increased cognitive load. In contrast, the peak frequency of alpha waves remained stable, indicating limited sensitivity to cognitive demand changes. Long-range temporal correlation increased under tasks requiring auditory attention, reflecting sustained attention-related neural dynamics, while the absolute power of delta waves showed no significant variation across tasks. Regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the power of alpha waves in noisy conditions and screening scores for auditory processing difficulties, suggesting its potential as a neural indicator.</td>

Previous work has shown that cross subject, cross-session invariant features exist in EEG. We propose a transfer learning pipeline based on a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) that leverages these invariants to reduce the burden of data acquisition and calibration. A baseline model is trained on EEG data from five able-bodied individuals and then rapidly updated with a small amount of data from a sixth, holdout subject. The remaining holdout data were used to test the performance of both the baseline and updated models. We repeated this procedure via a leave-one-subject out (LOSO) validation framework. Averaged over six LOSO folds, the updated model improved classification accuracy upon the baseline by 10.0, 18.8, and 22.1 percentage points on two binary and one ternary classification tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that decoding accuracy can be substantially improved with minimal subject-specific data. They also indicate that a CNN-based decoder can be personalized rapidly, enabling near plug-and-play BCI functionality for neurorehabilitation and other time-critical EEG applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2 staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment, as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to generate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional HER2 diagnostics.</td>

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in how machines "see" and "understand" language, are now fueling exciting progress in decoding brain signals from scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Prima facie, this opens the door to revolutionary brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed for real life, moving beyond traditional uses to envision Brain-to-Speech, Brain-to-Image, and even a Brain-to-Internet of Things (BCIoT).   However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.   Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations. Our aim is to lay out a clear roadmap for creating truly practical and effective EEG-based BCI solutions that can thrive in everyday environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With recent advancements in AI and computational tools, intelligent paradigms have emerged to enhance fields like shared autonomy and human-machine teaming in healthcare. Advanced AI algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can autonomously make decisions to achieve planning and motion goals. However, in healthcare, where human intent is crucial, fully independent machine decisions may not be ideal. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of human-centered shared autonomy AI frameworks, focusing on upper limb biosignal-based machine interfaces and associated motor control systems, including computer cursors, robotic arms, and planar platforms. We examine motor planning, learning (rehabilitation), and control, covering conceptual foundations of human-machine teaming in reach-and-grasp tasks and analyzing both theoretical and practical implementations. Each section explores how human and machine inputs can be blended for shared autonomy in healthcare applications. Topics include human factors, biosignal processing for intent detection, shared autonomy in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), rehabilitation, assistive robotics, and Large Language Models (LLMs) as the next frontier. We propose adaptive shared autonomy AI as a high-performance paradigm for collaborative human-AI systems, identify key implementation challenges, and outline future directions, particularly regarding AI reasoning agents. This analysis aims to bridge neuroscientific insights with robotics to create more intuitive, effective, and ethical human-machine teaming frameworks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy brain. However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The isomorphism problem for digraphs is a fundamental problem in graph theory. In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley digraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive integer. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly on the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$. In our previous paper, we developed a theory for $m$-Cayley isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and classified finite $m$CI-groups for each $m\geq 2$, and finite $m$PCI-groups for each $m\geq 4$. The next natural step is to classify finite $m$PCI-groups for $m=2$ or $3$. Note that BCI-groups form an important subclass of the $2$PCI-groups, which were introduced in 2008 by Xu et al. Despite much effort having been made on the study of BCI-groups, the problem of classifying finite BCI-groups is still widely open.   In this paper, we prove that every finite $2$PCI-group is solvable, and its Sylow $3$-subgroup is isomorphic to $Z_3, Z_3\times Z_3$ or $Z_9$, and Sylow $p$-subgroup with $p\not=3$ is either elementary abelian, or isomorphic to $Z_4$ or $Q_8$. We also introduce the kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and establish some useful theory for studying this kind of isomorphisms. Using the results of kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs together with the results on $2$PCI-groups, we give a proper description of finite BCI-groups, and in particular, we obtain a complete classification of finite non-abelian BCI-groups.</td>

CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent improvements in data quality and classification performance.</td>

We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.   To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite variations in architecture and pretraining strategies, recent studies indicate that large-scale AI models often converge toward similar internal representations that also align with neural activity. We propose that scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales. We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations, providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like AI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models' perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains, suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be generalized to neural measures.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on 28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S., South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based clinical research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test). Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related cognitive decline and NCD.</td>

Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The advance of speech decoding from non-invasive brain data holds the potential for profound societal impact. Among its most promising applications is the restoration of communication to paralysed individuals affected by speech deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the conditions for an "ImageNet moment" or breakthrough in non-invasive neural decoding, by harnessing the collective power of the machine learning community.   To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset recorded to date (LibriBrain) together with a user-friendly Python library (pnpl) for easy data access and integration with deep learning frameworks. For the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

LibriBrain comprises high-quality MEG recordings together with detailed annotations from a single participant listening to naturalistic spoken English, covering nearly the full Sherlock Holmes canon. Designed to support advances in neural decoding, LibriBrain comes with a Python library for streamlined integration with deep learning frameworks, standard data splits for reproducibility, and baseline results for three foundational decoding tasks: speech detection, phoneme classification, and word classification. Baseline experiments demonstrate that increasing training data yields substantial improvements in decoding performance, highlighting the value of scaling up deep, within-subject datasets.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Edge-Geodetic Sets play a crucial role in network monitoring and optimization, wherein the goal is to strategically place monitoring stations on vertices of a network, represented as a graph, to ensure complete coverage of edges and mitigate faults by monitoring lines of communication. This paper illustrates and explores the Monitoring Edge-Geodetic Set (MEG-set) problem, which involves determining the minimum set of vertices that need to be monitored to achieve geodetic coverage for a given network. The significance of this problem lies in its potential to facilitate efficient network monitoring, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of various applications. In this work, we prove the $\mathcal{NP}$-completeness of the MEG-set optimization problem by showing a reduction from the well-known Vertex Cover problem. Furthermore, we present inapproximability results, proving that the MEG-set optimization problem is $\mathcal{APX}$-Hard and that, if the unique games conjecture holds, the problem is not approximable within a factor of $2-\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. Despite its $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm achieving an approximation ratio of $O(\sqrt{|V(G)| \cdot \ln{|V(G)|})}$ for the MEG-set optimization problem, based on the well-known Set Cover approximation algorithm, where $|V(G)|$ is the number of nodes of the MEG-set instance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

RWESummary includes one scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5 models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study summarization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based systems.</td>

The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.</td>

To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings, which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust, efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical prognosis prediction workflows.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models for volumetric medical image segmentation have emerged as powerful tools in clinical workflows, enabling radiologists to delineate regions of interest through intuitive clicks. While these models demonstrate promising capabilities in segmenting previously unseen anatomical structures, their performance is strongly influenced by prompt quality. In clinical settings, radiologists often provide suboptimal prompts, which affects segmentation reliability and accuracy. To address this limitation, we present SafeClick, an error-tolerant interactive segmentation approach for medical volumes based on hierarchical expert consensus. SafeClick operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with foundation models including SAM 2 and MedSAM 2. The framework consists of two key components: a collaborative expert layer (CEL) that generates diverse feature representations through specialized transformer modules, and a consensus reasoning layer (CRL) that performs cross-referencing and adaptive integration of these features. This architecture transforms the segmentation process from a prompt-dependent operation to a robust framework capable of producing accurate results despite imperfect user inputs. Extensive experiments across 15 public datasets demonstrate that our plug-and-play approach consistently improves the performance of base foundation models, with particularly significant gains when working with imperfect prompts.
