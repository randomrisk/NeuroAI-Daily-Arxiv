<td style='padding: 4px;'>AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow, single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models (FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing 150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging. Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative, rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for mitigating security risks in real-world applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a study of core fragmentation in the W51-E and W51-IRS2 protoclusters in the W51 high-mass star-forming region. The identification of core fragmentation is achieved by the spatial correspondence of cores and compact sources which are detected in the short (low resolution) and the long baseline (high resolution) continuum images with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 3 (3 mm) and 6 (1.3 mm), respectively. We characterize the compact sources found in the long baseline image, and conclude that the compact sources are pre/protostellar objects (PPOs) that are either prestellar dust cores or dust disks or envelopes around protostars. The observed trend of core fragmentation in W51 is that (i) massive cores host more PPOs, (ii) bright PPOs are preferentially formed in massive cores, (iii) equipartition of flux between PPOs is uncommon. Thermal Jeans masses of parent cores are insufficient to explain the masses of their fragments, and this trend is more prominent at high-mass cores. We also find that unfragmented cores are large, less massive, and less dense than fragmented cores.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy and interpretability in brain tumor classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations, such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mathematical network models are extremely useful to capture complex propagation processes between different regions (nodes), for example the spread of an infectious agent between different countries, or the transport and replication of toxic proteins across different brain regions in neurodegenerative diseases. In these models, transport is modeled at the macroscale through an operator, the so-called graph Laplacian, based on the edge properties and topology, capturing the fluxes between different nodes of the network. However, this phenomenological approach fails to take into account the physical processes taking place at the microscale within the edge. A fundamental problem is then to obtain a transport operator from mechanistic principles based on the underlying transport process. Using advection-reaction-diffusion as a generic mechanism for inter-nodal exchanges, we derive a multiscale network transport model and obtain the corresponding linear transport operator at the macroscale from first principles. This effective graph Laplacian is fully determined by the transport mechanisms along the edges at the microscale. We show that this operator correctly captures the transport, and we study its scaling properties with respect to edge length.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks, volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In our age of digital platforms, human attention has become a scarce and highly valuable resource, rivalrous, tradable, and increasingly subject to market dynamics. This article explores the commodification of attention within the framework of the attention economy, arguing that attention should be understood as a common good threatened by over-exploitation. Drawing from philosophical, economic, and legal perspectives, we first conceptualize attention not only as an individual cognitive process but as a collective and infrastructural phenomenon susceptible to enclosure by digital intermediaries. We then identify and analyze negative externalities of the attention economy, particularly those stemming from excessive screen time: diminished individual agency, adverse health outcomes, and societal and political harms, including democratic erosion and inequality. These harms are largely unpriced by market actors and constitute a significant market failure. In response, among a spectrum of public policy tools ranging from informational campaigns to outright restrictions, we propose a Pigouvian tax on attention capture as a promising regulatory instrument to internalize the externalities and, in particular, the social cost of compulsive digital engagement. Such a tax would incentivize structural changes in platform design while preserving user autonomy. By reclaiming attention as a shared resource vital to human agency, health, and democracy, this article contributes a novel economic and policy lens to the debate on digital regulation. Ultimately, this article advocates for a paradigm shift: from treating attention as a private, monetizable asset to protecting it as a collective resource vital for humanity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in 177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12 months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations. Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation. Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's prosocial development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The phase locking value (PLV) is a widely used measure to detect phase connectivity. Main drawbacks of the standard PLV are it can be sensitive to noisy observations and does not provide uncertainty measures under finite samples. To overcome the difficulty, we propose a model-based PLV through nonparametric statistical modeling. Specifically, since the discrete time series of phase can be regarded as a functional observation taking values on circle, we employ a Bayesian model for circular-variate functional data, which gives denoising and inference on the resulting PLV values. The proposed model is defined through "wrapping" functional Gaussian models on real line, for which we develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm using Gibbs sampler. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation experiments based on real EEG data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold significant potential for assistive technologies and neurorehabilitation. However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686. Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions. Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability, which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine) face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs. Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets. We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet, CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF), semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is ubiquitous in biology and medicine.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load, attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes. The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31 subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of 93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition is essential for applications in affective computing and behavioral prediction, but conventional systems relying on single-modality data often fail to capture the complexity of affective states. To address this limitation, we propose an emotion recognition framework that achieves accurate multimodal alignment of Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movement data through a hybrid architecture based on cross-modal attention mechanism. Experiments on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that our method achieve 90.62% accuracy. This work provides a promising foundation for leveraging multimodal data in emotion recognition</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models, their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification setting.   We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing trends observed in large language models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image, and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content. With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB) strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by 2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.</td>

Compared with invasively recorded electroencephalography (EEG), non-invasive recording offers a more practical and feasible approach to capturing brain signals for BCI. This study explores the limit of decoding non-invasive EEG associated with handwriting imagery into English letters using deep neural networks. To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the 26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific patterns in the dataset. Subsequently, four convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained for EEG classification.

Under the chance level of accuracy at 3.85%, the CNN classifiers trained on each participant reached the highest limit of around 20%. This study marks the first attempt to decode non-invasive EEG associated with handwriting imagery.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold significant potential for assistive technologies and neurorehabilitation. However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%, 68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/MATL-DC.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

Such devices have the potential to be useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of (Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset.

Crucially, our data was recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k, around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale, cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of effective deep neural models of visual cognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural correlates of sensory imagery is crucial for advancing cognitive neuroscience and developing novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigms. This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\deg}C Hot, 20{\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG + eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and accessibility.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Ultra-high field 7T fMRI offers notable advantages over 3T fMRI, including higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, enabling finer spatial and temporal resolution. This study explores the differences in activation maps from Human Connectome Project datasets between 7T and 3T field strengths, focusing on visual identified using the Glasser atlas. Functional tasks for each scanner were designed to include visual stimuli, with data processed uniformly to ensure comparability. Results showed significantly higher beta coefficients for common regions of activation, such as V3A and V3B, in 7T compared to 3T datasets. This suggests that 7T fMRI data more accurately reflect the idealized time course of task-related conditions, likely due to improved sensitivity to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, variations in experimental design and acquisition parameters between scanners complicate the direct comparison of beta coefficients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation, connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mean-field models provide a link between microscopic neuronal activity and macroscopic brain dynamics. Their derivation depends on simplifying assumptions, such as all-to-all connectivity, limiting their biological realism. To overcome this, we introduce a data-driven framework in which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns the macroscopic dynamics directly from simulations of a network of spiking neurons. The network connection probability serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment, which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical model. For validation, we use simulation-based inference on synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate accurate parameter recovery for the novel mean-field model, while the current state-of-the-art models lead to biased estimates. This work presents a flexible and generic framework for building more realistic whole-brain models, bridging the gap between microscale mechanisms and macroscopic brain recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and adapt to complex AI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction, constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity, alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based neuroimaging.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG) is gaining significant traction as a neuroimaging tool, with the potential for improved performance and practicality compared to conventional instrumentation. However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices. This represents a significant step on the path towards OPMs becoming the sensor of choice for MEG measurement.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. However, while researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process-converting images to M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage-remains largely unexplored. Thus, we present the first image-to-brain signal (M/EEG) framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. Furthermore, we evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Additionally, we pioneer the visualization of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a novel quantile function-based approach for neuroimaging classification using Wasserstein-Fr\'echet regression, specifically applied to the detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on the MEG and MRI data. Conventional neuroimaging classification methods for mTBI detection typically extract summary statistics from brain signals across the different epochs, which may result in the loss of important distributional information, such as variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc. Our approach treats complete probability density functions of epoch space results as functional response variables within a Wasserstein-Fr\'echet regression framework, thereby preserving the full distributional characteristics of epoch results from $L_{1}$ minimum norm solutions. The global Wasserstein-Fr\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection. In practical applications, the test accuracy on unseen data from Innovision IP's dataset achieves up to 98\%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) experiments provide promising avenues to probe new physics contributions from extended neutrino sectors in beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. We consider a Left--Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) extended with three generations of sterile neutrinos to realize a double type-I seesaw mechanism for light neutrino mass generation. The double seesaw induces maximal lepton number violation in the right-handed sector and facilitates enhanced Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos, thereby leading to their dominant contributions in both cLFV and $0\nu\beta\beta$ processes. We perform a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space for new-physics contributions to the cLFV decay $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to $0\nu\beta\beta$, considering two different textures for the Dirac mass matrices: one proportional to the identity matrix and another fully determined by the model framework. A detailed analysis of the common parameter regions accessible to current experiments like KamLAND-Zen and LEGEND-200, and upcoming experiments, such as MEG-II and LEGEND-1000, is presented, underscoring the phenomenological relevance of this framework. Our results aim to provide optimistic benchmarks for future searches targeting right-handed current-mediated neutrino interactions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Single-channel SQUID system technology, operating at a noise level of 100s of aT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$, enables the non-invasive detection of synchronized spiking activity at the single-trial level via magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, when combined with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, the noise performance of the ultrasensitive MEG system can be greatly diminished. This issue negates some of the complementary qualities of these two recording methods. In addition, typical electrical components required for electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, a common method for evoking specific brain responses, are also observed to have a detrimental influence on ultra-low MEG noise performance. These effects are caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and typically preclude single-trial detection. This work outlines, how careful design allows a significant reduction of the impact of EMI when these different electronic systems are operated concurrently. This optimization enabled the simultaneous single-trial detection of synchronized spiking activity using these two highly sensitive recording modalities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</td>

Applied across diverse molecular systems, the method accurately infers the committor function and highlights the importance of each heavy atom in the transition mechanism. It also yields precise estimates of the rate constants for the underlying processes. The proposed approach opens new avenues for understanding and modeling complex dynamics, by enabling CV-free learning and automated identification of physically meaningful reaction coordinates of complex molecular processes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows, particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks, their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep, computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Superconducting REBCO ($RE$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, where $RE$ is a rare earth, typically Y, Gd or Eu) electromagnets are useful for many applications like medical magnetic resonace imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and magnets for particle accelerators and detectors. REBCO magnets are also the core of many nuclear fusion energy start-ups. In order to avoid permanent damage during operation, magnet design needs to take electro-thermal quench into account, which is due to unavoidable REBCO tape or magnet imperfections. However, most high-field magnet designs do not take superconducting screening currents into account. In this work, we show that it is essential to consider screening currents in magnet design, since they highly speed-up electrothermal quench propagation. Our study is based on detailed numerical modeling, based on the Minimum Electromagnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Differences (MEMEP-FD). Benchmarking with well-established Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) model supports the correctness of MEMEP-FD. This work focusses on a 32 T all-superconducting magnet design and we analyze in detail the time evolution of electrothermal quench. Our findings will have an impact in the design of ultra-high-field magnets for NMR or user facilities, and possibly for other kinds of magnets, like those for fusion energy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary, typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon, or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprising diverse clinical data such as diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results, hold great promise for translational research. EHR-derived data have advanced disease prevention, improved clinical trial recruitment, and generated real-world evidence. Synthesizing EHRs across institutions enables large-scale, generalizable studies that capture rare diseases and population diversity, but remains hindered by the heterogeneity of medical codes, institution-specific terminologies, and the absence of standardized data structures. These barriers limit the interpretability, comparability, and scalability of EHR-based analyses, underscoring the need for robust methods to harmonize and extract meaningful insights from distributed, heterogeneous data. To address this, we propose MASH (Multi-source Automated Structured Hierarchy), a fully automated framework that aligns medical codes across institutions using neural optimal transport and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic embeddings. During training, MASH integrates information from pre-trained language models, co-occurrence patterns, textual descriptions, and supervised labels to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships among medical concepts more effectively. Applied to real-world EHR data, including diagnosis, medication, and laboratory codes, MASH produces interpretable hierarchical graphs that facilitate the navigation and understanding of heterogeneous clinical data. Notably, it generates the first automated hierarchies for unstructured local laboratory codes, establishing foundational references for downstream applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al. (2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset. However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Maternal-fetal Ultrasound is the primary modality for monitoring fetal development, yet automated segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality annotations. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework that leverages information divergence for robust fetal ultrasound segmentation. Our method employs a lightweight convolutional network (1.47M parameters) and a Transformer-based network, trained jointly with labelled data through standard supervision and with unlabelled data via cross-supervision. To encourage consistent and confident predictions, we introduce an information divergence loss that combines per-pixel Kullback-Leibler divergence and Mutual Information Gap, effectively reducing prediction disagreement between the two models. In addition, we apply mixup on unlabelled samples to further enhance robustness. Experiments on two fetal ultrasound datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. When only 5% of training data is labelled, our framework improves the Dice score by 2.39%, reduces the 95% Hausdorff distance by 14.90, and decreases the Average Surface Distance by 4.18. These results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging information divergence for annotation-efficient and robust medical image segmentation. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: To develop and validate a practical framework to overcome common issues in inline deployment of established offline MR reconstruction, including (1) delay from lengthy reconstructions, (2) limited support for multi-scan input reconstructions, (3) the need to adapt scripts for different raw formats, and (4) limited guidance and experience in retaining scanner reconstructions and applying scanner-based post-processing to custom outputs. Methods: The framework builds upon the Gadgetron platform and includes: (1) an input converter to transform ISMRMRD format raw into a Siemens format raw structure, facilitating reuse of existing code; (2) an asynchronous trigger-and-retrieve mechanism enabling long reconstructions without delaying scanner processes; (3) resource-aware scheduling for parallel execution; (4) integrated file management to support multi-scan inputs; and (5) preservation of scanner-based reconstructions and post-processing. The framework was validated on 2 Siemens scanners for SENSE, AlignedSENSE, and NUFFT reconstructions, and in a large-cohort study. Results: Minimum code modification for inline deployment has been shown, and all reconstructions were successfully executed inline without disrupting scanner workflows. Images were retrieved via automated or retro-reconstruction, with scanner-based post-processing applied to custom outputs. Multi-scan input reconstructions were executed using GPU-aware scheduling, confirming feasibility for routine and large-scale applications. In 480 consecutive examinations, inline reconstructions were retrieved in 99% of cases without disruptions. Conclusion: The framework lowers the technical barrier to inline deployment of offline reconstructions, enabling robust, scalable, and post-processing-compatible integration. It is openly available with documentation and demonstration cases to support reproducibility and community adoption.</td>
