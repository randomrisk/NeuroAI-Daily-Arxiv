<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of machine learning in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically in neuroimaging, is proving to be incredibly effective, leading to better diagnostic accuracy, accelerated image analysis, and data-driven insights, which can potentially transform patient care. Deep learning models utilize multiple layers of processing to capture intricate details of complex data, which can then be used on a variety of tasks, including brain tumor classification, segmentation, image synthesis, and registration. Previous research demonstrates high accuracy in tumor segmentation using various model architectures, including nn-UNet and Swin-UNet. U-Mamba, which uses state space modeling, also achieves high accuracy in medical image segmentation. To leverage these models, we propose a deep learning framework that ensembles these state-of-the-art architectures to achieve accurate segmentation and produce finely synthesized images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Proton spot-scanning arc therapy (ARC) is an emerging modality that can improve the high-dose conformity to targets compared with standard intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). However, the efficient treatment delivery of ARC is challenging due to the required frequent energy changes during the continuous gantry rotation. This work proposes a novel method that delivers a multiple IMPT (multi-IMPT) plan that is equivalent to ARC in terms of biologically effective dose (BED).   Approach: The proposed multi-IMPT method utilizes a different subset of limited number of beam angles in each fraction for dose delivery. Due to the different dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR) in each fraction, we optimize biologically effective dose (BED) for OAR and the physical dose delivered for target in each fraction. The BED-based multi-IMPT inverse optimization problem is solved via the iterative convex relaxation method and the alternating direction method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-IMPT method is evaluated in terms of dose objectives in comparison with ARC.   Main results: Multi-IMPT provided similar plan quality with ARC. For example, multi-IMPT provided better OAR sparing and slightly better target dose coverage for the prostate case; similar dose distribution for the lung case; slightly worse dose coverage for the brain case; better dose coverage but slightly higher BED in OAR for the head-and-neck case.   Significance: We have proposed a multi-IMPT approach to deliver ARC-equivalent plan quality.   Keywords: biologically effective dose (BED), proton arc therapy</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we apply the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation to the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find a combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score on in-domain and out-of-distribution data. We demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted for WMH segmentation and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration, with median class balanced accuracy for classification models with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) of 0.71/0.66/0.60 in the Deep WMH and 0.82/0.77/0.73 in the Periventricular WMH regions respectively. We demonstrate that stochastic UQ techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality segmentations. Finally, we qualitatively analyse the semantic information captured by UQ techniques and demonstrate that uncertainty can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions, while identifying clusters of small WMH in deep white matter unsegmented by the model.</td>

Conventional methods including passwords, personal identification numbers, and identification tags are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper suggests a paradigm shift towards biometric identification technology that leverages unique physiological or behavioral characteristics for user authenticity verification. Nevertheless, biometric solutions like fingerprints, iris patterns, facial and voice recognition are also susceptible to forgery and deception. We propose using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for individual identification to address this challenge. Derived from unique brain activities, these signals offer promising authentication potential and provide a novel means for liveness detection, thereby mitigating spoofing attacks. This study employs a public dataset initially compiled for fatigue analysis, featuring EEG data from 12 subjects recorded via an eight-channel OpenBCI helmet. This dataset extracts salient features from the EEG signals and trains a supervised multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier. Upon evaluation, the classifier model achieves a maximum accuracy of 92.9\%, leveraging ten features from each channel.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The neocortex, a complex system driving multi-region interactions, remains a core puzzle in neuroscience. Despite quantitative insights across brain scales, understanding the mechanisms underlying neural activities is challenging. Advances from Hopfield networks to large-scale cortical models have deepened neural network theory, yet these models often fall short of capturing global brain functions. In large-scale cortical networks, an intriguing hierarchy of timescales reflects diverse information processing speeds across spatial regions. As a non-equilibrium system, the brain incurs significant energy costs, with long-distance connectivity suggesting an evolutionary spatial organization. To explore these complexities, we introduce a nonequilibrium landscape flux approach to analyze cortical networks. This allows us to quantify potential landscapes and principal transition paths, uncovering dynamical characteristics across timescales. We examine whether temporal hierarchies correlate with stimuli distribution and how hierarchical networks exhibit differential responses. Furthermore, our analysis quantifies the thermodynamic cost of sustaining cognition, highlighting a link to network connectivity. These findings provide insights into energy consumption during cognitive processes and emphasize the spatial benefits for working memory tasks. Experimental validation is challenging due to evolutionary variability, making our theoretical approach valuable for quantifying complex dynamics. By assessing time irreversibility and critical slowdown, we gain predictive insights into network bifurcations and state transitions, offering practical tools for identifying cortical state changes. These results advance our understanding of cortical dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper contributes to the "BraTS 2024 Brain MR Image Synthesis Challenge" and presents a conditional Wavelet Diffusion Model (cWDM) for directly solving a paired image-to-image translation task on high-resolution volumes. While deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation models have demonstrated clear clinical utility, they typically require MR scans from various modalities (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR) as input. However, due to time constraints or imaging artifacts, some of these modalities may be missing, hindering the application of well-performing segmentation algorithms in clinical routine. To address this issue, we propose a method that synthesizes one missing modality image conditioned on three available images, enabling the application of downstream segmentation models. We treat this paired image-to-image translation task as a conditional generation problem and solve it by combining a Wavelet Diffusion Model for high-resolution 3D image synthesis with a simple conditioning strategy. This approach allows us to directly apply our model to full-resolution volumes, avoiding artifacts caused by slice- or patch-wise data processing. While this work focuses on a specific application, the presented method can be applied to all kinds of paired image-to-image translation problems, such as CT $\leftrightarrow$ MR and MR $\leftrightarrow$ PET translation, or mask-conditioned anatomically guided image generation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Iron oxide (e.g., Fe$_3$O$_4$ or Fe$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles are promising candidates for a variety of biomedical applications ranging from magnetic hyperthermia therapy to drug delivery and bio-detection, due to their superparamagnetism, non-toxicity, and biodegradability. While particles of small size (below a critical size, ~20 nm) display superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, these particles tend to penetrate highly sensitive areas of the body such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to undesired effects. In addition, these particles possess a high probability of retention, which can lead to genotoxicity and biochemical toxicity. Increasing particle size is a means for addressing these problems but also suppresses the superparamagnetism. We have overcome this particle size limit by synthesizing unique polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles composed of multiple nanocrystals of 10 to 15 nm size while tuning particle size from 160 to 400 nm. These so-called superparticles preserve superparamagnetic characteristics and exhibit excellent hyperthermia responses. The specific absorption rates (SAR) exceed 250 W/g (HAC = 800 Oe, f = 310 kHz) at a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, indicating their capability in cancer treatment with minimum dose. Our study underscores the potential of size-tunable polycrystalline iron oxide superparticles with superparamagnetic properties for advanced biomedical applications and sensing technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans have an exquisite sense of touch which robotic and prosthetic systems aim to recreate. We developed algorithms to create neuron-like (neuromorphic) spiking representations of texture that are invariant to the scanning speed and contact force applied in the sensing process. The spiking representations are based on mimicking activity from mechanoreceptors in human skin and further processing up to the brain. The neuromorphic encoding process transforms analog sensor readings into speed and force invariant spiking representations in three sequential stages: the force invariance module (in the analog domain), the spiking activity encoding module (transforms from analog to spiking domain), and the speed invariance module (in the spiking domain). The algorithms were tested on a tactile texture dataset collected in 15 speed-force conditions. An offline texture classification system built on the invariant representations has higher classification accuracy, improved computational efficiency, and increased capability to identify textures explored in novel speed-force conditions. The speed invariance algorithm was adapted to a real-time human-operated texture classification system. Similarly, the invariant representations improved classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and capability to identify textures explored in novel conditions. The invariant representation is even more crucial in this context due to human imprecision which seems to the classification system as a novel condition. These results demonstrate that invariant neuromorphic representations enable better performing neurorobotic tactile sensing systems. Furthermore, because the neuromorphic representations are based on biological processing, this work can be used in the future as the basis for naturalistic sensory feedback for upper limb amputees.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Markov chains are simple yet powerful mathematical structures to model temporally dependent processes. They generally assume stationary data, i.e., fixed transition probabilities between observations/states. However, live, real-world processes, like in the context of activity tracking, biological time series, or industrial monitoring, often switch behavior over time. Such behavior switches can be modeled as transitions between higher-level \emph{modes} (e.g., running, walking, etc.). Yet all modes are usually not previously known, often exhibit vastly differing transition probabilities, and can switch unpredictably. Thus, to track behavior changes of live, real-world processes, this study proposes an online and efficient method to construct Evolving Markov chains (EMCs). EMCs adaptively track transition probabilities, automatically discover modes, and detect mode switches in an online manner. In contrast to previous work, EMCs are of arbitrary order, the proposed update scheme does not rely on tracking windows, only updates the relevant region of the probability tensor, and enjoys geometric convergence of the expected estimates. Our evaluation of synthetic data and real-world applications on human activity recognition, electric motor condition monitoring, and eye-state recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements illustrates the versatility of the approach and points to the potential of EMCs to efficiently track, model, and understand live, real-world processes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Jansen-Rit model of a cortical column in the cerebral cortex is widely used to simulate spontaneous brain activity (EEG) and event-related potentials. It couples a pyramidal cell population with two interneuron populations, of which one is fast and excitatory and the other slow and inhibitory. Our paper studies the transition between alpha and delta oscillations produced by the model. Delta oscillations are slower than alpha oscillations and have a more complex relaxation-type time profile. In the context of neuronal population activation dynamics, a small threshold means that neurons begin to activate with small input or stimulus, indicating high sensitivity to incoming signals. A steep slope signifies that activation increases sharply as input crosses the threshold. Accordingly in the model the excitatory activation thresholds are small and the slopes are steep. Hence, a singular limit replacing the excitatory activation function with all-or-nothing switches, eg. a Heaviside function, is appropriate. In this limit we identify the transition between alpha and delta oscillations as a discontinuity-induced grazing bifurcation. At the grazing the minimum of the pyramidal-cell output equals the threshold for switching off the excitatory interneuron population, leading to a collapse in excitatory feedback.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In diagnosing mental diseases from electroencephalography (EEG) data, neural network models such as Transformers have been employed to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, it is crucial to learn the spatial relationships between EEG sensors, for which Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly used. However, fine-tuning large-scale complex neural network models simultaneously to capture both temporal and spatial features increases computational costs due to the more significant number of trainable parameters. It causes the limited availability of EEG datasets for downstream tasks, making it challenging to fine-tune large models effectively. We propose EEG-GraphAdapter (EGA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach to address these challenges. EGA is integrated into pre-trained temporal backbone models as a GNN-based module and fine-tuned itself alone while keeping the backbone model parameters frozen. This enables the acquisition of spatial representations of EEG signals for downstream tasks, significantly reducing computational overhead and data requirements. Experimental evaluations on healthcare-related downstream tasks of Major Depressive Disorder and Abnormality Detection demonstrate that our EGA improves performance by up to 16.1% in the F1-score compared with the backbone BENDR model.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys on a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following visual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by letter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands that increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for more efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings and a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined with its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users with communication and motor disabilities.</td>

The purpose of this experiment is to explore the potential applications of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in enhancing emotional regulation for individuals with neurological and physiological disorders. The research focuses on the development of a novel neural network algorithm for understanding EEG data, with a particular emphasis on recognizing and regulating emotional states. The procedure involves the collection of EEG-based emotion data from open-Neuro. Using novel data modification techniques, information from the dataset can be altered to create a dataset that has neural patterns of patients with disorders whilst showing emotional change. The data analysis reveals promising results, as the algorithm is able to successfully classify emotional states with a high degree of accuracy. This suggests that EEG-based BCIs have the potential to be a valuable tool in aiding individuals with a range of neurological and physiological disorders in recognizing and regulating their emotions. To improve upon this work, data collection on patients with neurological disorders should be done to improve overall sample diversity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This manuscript describes and implementation of scripts of code aimed at reducing the influence of artifacts, specifically focused on ocular artifacts, in the measurement and processing of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This process is of importance because it benefits the analysis and study of long trial samples when the appearance of ocular artifacts cannot be avoided by simply discarding trials. The implementations provided to the reader illustrate, with slight modifications, previously proposed methods aimed at the partial or complete elimination of EEG channels or components are those that resemble the electro-oculogram (EOG) signals in which artifacts are detected.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential in neuroscience and clinical practice, yet it suffers from physiological artifacts, particularly electromyography (EMG), which distort signals. We propose a deep learning model using pix2pixGAN to remove such noise and generate reliable EEG signals. Leveraging the EEGdenoiseNet dataset, we created synthetic datasets with controlled EMG noise levels for model training and testing across a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7 to 2. Our evaluation metrics included RRMSE and Pearson's CC, assessing both time and frequency domains, and compared our model with others. The pix2pixGAN model excelled, especially under high noise conditions, showing significant improvements in lower RRMSE and higher CC values. This demonstrates the model's superior accuracy and stability in purifying EEG signals, offering a robust solution for EEG analysis challenges and advancing clinical and neuroscience applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human brain receives stimuli in multiple ways; among them, audio constitutes an important source of relevant stimuli for the brain regarding communication, amusement, warning, etc. In this context, the aim of this manuscript is to advance in the classification of brain responses to music of diverse genres and to sounds of different nature: speech and music. For this purpose, two different experiments have been designed to acquiere EEG signals from subjects listening to songs of different musical genres and sentences in various languages. With this, a novel scheme is proposed to characterize brain signals for their classification; this scheme is based on the construction of a feature matrix built on relations between energy measured at the different EEG channels and the usage of a bi-LSTM neural network. With the data obtained, evaluations regarding EEG-based classification between speech and music, different musical genres, and whether the subject likes the song listened to or not are carried out. The experiments unveil satisfactory performance to the proposed scheme. The results obtained for binary audio type classification attain 98.66% of success. In multi-class classification between 4 musical genres, the accuracy attained is 61.59%, and results for binary classification of musical taste rise to 96.96%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a way to understand, and evaluate neurotransmission. In this context, time-locked EEG activity or event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used to capture neural activity related to specific mental processes. Normally, they are considered on the basis of averages across a number of trials. However, there exist notable variability in latency jitter, jitter, and amplitude, across trials, and, also, across users; this causes the average ERP waveform to blur, and, furthermore, diminish the amplitude of underlying waves. For these reasons, a strategy is proposed for obtaining ERP waveforms based on dynamic time warping (DTW) to adapt, and adjust individual trials to the averaged ERP, previously calculated, to build an enhanced average by making use of these warped signals. At the sight of the experiments carried out on the behaviour of the proposed scheme using publicly available datasets, this strategy reduces the attenuation in amplitude of ERP components thanks to the reduction of the influence of variability of latency and jitter, and, thus, improves the averaged ERP waveforms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), we not only need to accurately decode brain signals,but also need to consider the explainability of the decoding process, which is related to the reliability of the model. In the process of designing a decoder or processing brain signals, we need to explain the discovered phenomena in physical or physiological way. An explainable model not only makes the signal processing process clearer and improves reliability, but also allows us to better understand brain activities and facilitate further exploration of the brain. In this paper, we systematically analyze the multi-classification dataset of visual brain signals ECoG, using a simple and highly explainable method to explore the ways in which ECoG carry visual information, then based on these findings, we propose a model called MST-ECoGNet that combines traditional mathematics and deep learning. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) found that ECoG time-frequency domain information carries visual information, provides important features for visual classification tasks. The mathematical method of MST (Modified S Transform) can effectively extract temporal-frequency domain information; 2) The spatial domain of ECoG signals also carries visual information, the unique spatial features are also important features for classification tasks; 3) The real and imaginary information in the time-frequency domain are complementary. The effective combination of the two is more helpful for classification tasks than using amplitude information alone; 4) Finally, compared with previous work, our model is smaller and has higher performance: for the object MonJ, the model size is reduced to 10.82% of base model, the accuracy is improved by 6.63%; for the object MonC, the model size is reduced to 8.78%, the accuracy is improved by 16.63%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>P300 speller BCIs allow users to compose sentences by selecting target keys on a GUI through the detection of P300 component in their EEG signals following visual stimuli. Most P300 speller BCIs require users to spell words letter by letter, or the first few initial letters, resulting in high keystroke demands that increase time, cognitive load, and fatigue. This highlights the need for more efficient, user-friendly methods for faster sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A new GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. SWLDA is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that in Task 1, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by 62.14% and 53.22%, respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by 198.96%. In Task 2, ChatBCI achieves 80.68% keystroke savings and a record 8.53 characters/min for typing speed. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries, enhances sentence composition in realistic scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-) word predictions, combined with its new GUI, pave the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, especially for users with communication and motor disabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neurological and Physiological Disorders that impact emotional regulation each have their own unique characteristics which are important to understand in order to create a generalized solution to all of them. The purpose of this experiment is to explore the potential applications of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in enhancing emotional regulation for individuals with neurological and physiological disorders. The research focuses on the development of a novel neural network algorithm for understanding EEG data, with a particular emphasis on recognizing and regulating emotional states. The procedure involves the collection of EEG-based emotion data from open-Neuro. Using novel data modification techniques, information from the dataset can be altered to create a dataset that has neural patterns of patients with disorders whilst showing emotional change. The data analysis reveals promising results, as the algorithm is able to successfully classify emotional states with a high degree of accuracy. This suggests that EEG-based BCIs have the potential to be a valuable tool in aiding individuals with a range of neurological and physiological disorders in recognizing and regulating their emotions. To improve upon this work, data collection on patients with neurological disorders should be done to improve overall sample diversity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion recognition has significant potential in healthcare and affect-sensitive systems such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, challenges such as the high cost of labeled data and variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals limit the applicability of EEG-based emotion recognition models across domains. These challenges are exacerbated in cross-dataset scenarios due to differences in subject demographics, recording devices, and presented stimuli. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to improve cross-domain EEG-based emotion classification. Our method, Gradual Proximity-guided Target Data Selection (GPTDS), incrementally selects reliable target domain samples for training. By evaluating their proximity to source clusters and the models confidence in predicting them, GPTDS minimizes negative transfer caused by noisy and diverse samples. Additionally, we introduce Prediction Confidence-aware Test-Time Augmentation (PC-TTA), a cost-effective augmentation technique. Unlike traditional TTA methods, which are computationally intensive, PC-TTA activates only when model confidence is low, improving inference performance while drastically reducing computational costs. Experiments on the DEAP and SEED datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. When trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, our model achieves 67.44% accuracy, a 7.09% improvement over the baseline. Conversely, training on SEED and testing on DEAP yields 59.68% accuracy, a 6.07% improvement. Furthermore, PC-TTA reduces computational time by a factor of 15 compared to traditional TTA methods. Our method excels in detecting both positive and negative emotions, demonstrating its practical utility in healthcare applications.

The framework includes two essential components: user identification and intention classification, which enable personalized services by identifying individual users and recognizing their intended actions through EEG signals. We validate the feasibility of our framework using a private EEG dataset collected from eight subjects, employing the ShallowConvNet architecture to decode EEG features. The experimental results demonstrate that user identification achieved an average classification accuracy of 0.995, while intention classification achieved 0.47 accuracy across all paradigms, with MI demonstrating the best performance. These findings indicate that EEG signals can effectively support personalized BCI applications, offering robust identification and reliable intention decoding, especially for MI and SI.</td>

This study investigates the classification performance and brain connectivity patterns associated with these paradigms, focusing on decoding accuracy across selected word classes. Sixteen participants engaged in tasks involving thirteen imagined speech and visual imagery classes, revealing above-chance classification accuracy for both paradigms. Variability in classification accuracy across individual classes highlights the influence of sensory and motor associations in imagined speech and vivid visual associations in visual imagery. Connectivity analysis further demonstrated increased functional connectivity in language-related and sensory regions for imagined speech, whereas visual imagery activated spatial and visual processing networks. These findings suggest the potential of imagined speech and visual imagery as an intuitive and scalable paradigm for BCI communication when selecting optimal word classes. Further exploration of the decoding outcomes for these two paradigms could provide insights for practical BCI communication.</td>

We then restrict our attention to abelian groups and, with an exception, reduce the problem to the isomorphism problem for a related quotient, component, or corresponding Cayley digraph. For Haar graphs of an abelian group of odd order with connection sets $S$ those of Cayley graphs (i.e. $S = -S$), the exception does not exist.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a computer. Most research so far studied more accurate BCIs, but much less attention has been paid to the ethics of BCIs. Aside from task-specific information, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, disorders, etc., which should be protected. Approach: We show for the first time that adding user-wise perturbations can make identity information in EEG unlearnable. We propose four types of user-wise privacy-preserving perturbations, i.e., random noise, synthetic noise, error minimization noise, and error maximization noise. After adding the proposed perturbations to EEG training data, the user identity information in the data becomes unlearnable, while the BCI task information remains unaffected. Main results: Experiments on six EEG datasets using three neural network classifiers and various traditional machine learning models demonstrated the robustness and practicability of the proposed perturbations. Significance: Our research shows the feasibility of hiding user identity information in EEG data without impacting the primary BCI task information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning has achieved great success in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Most existing BCI studies focused on improving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial security. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in other application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed that their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on benign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of data alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers simultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets from two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event related potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers (EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings (offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online cross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its effectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are usually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously improve the model accuracy and robustness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The significant inter-subject variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals often leads to knowledge being overwritten as new tasks are introduced in continual EEG decoding. While retraining on the entire dataset with each new input can prevent forgetting, this approach incurs high computational costs. An ideal brain-computer interface (BCI) model should continuously learn new information without retraining from scratch, thus reducing these costs. Most transfer learning models rely on large source-domain datasets for pre-training, yet data availability is frequently limited in real-world applications due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, such models are prone to catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a personalized subject-incremental learning (SIL) framework for continual EEG decoding that integrates Euclidean Alignment for fast domain adaptation, an exemplar replay mechanism to retain prior knowledge, and reservoir sampling-based memory management to handle memory constraints in long-term learning. Validated on the OpenBMI dataset with 54 subjects, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention with classification performance in continual MI-EEG tasks, offering a scalable solution for real-world BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) aims to extract visual information perceived by humans from brain activity recorded through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Despite notable advancements in recent years, existing studies in VBU continue to face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose knowledge from prior subjects as they adapt to new ones. Addressing continual learning in this field is, therefore, essential. This paper introduces a novel framework called Continual Learning for Vision-Brain (COBRA) to address continual learning in VBU. Our approach includes three novel modules: a Subject Commonality (SC) module, a Prompt-based Subject Specific (PSS) module, and a transformer-based module for fMRI, denoted as MRIFormer module. The SC module captures shared vision-brain patterns across subjects, preserving this knowledge as the model encounters new subjects, thereby reducing the impact of catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, the PSS module learns unique vision-brain patterns specific to each subject. Finally, the MRIFormer module contains a transformer encoder and decoder that learns the fMRI features for VBU from common and specific patterns. In a continual learning setup, COBRA is trained in new PSS and MRIFormer modules for new subjects, leaving the modules of previous subjects unaffected. As a result, COBRA effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both continual learning and vision-brain reconstruction tasks, surpassing previous methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Working memory plays a crucial role in various aspects of human life. Therefore, it has been an area of interest in different research studies, especially neuroscience. The neuroscientists investigating working memory have primarily emphasized the brain's functional modularity. At the same time, a holistic perspective is still required to investigate the brain as an integrated and unified system. We hypothesized that the brain should shift towards a more stable state during working memory than the resting state. Therefore, based on the Structural Balance Theory (SBT), we aimed to address this process. To achieve this, we examined triadic associations in signed fMRI networks in healthy individuals using the N-back as the working memory task. We demonstrated that the number of balanced triads increased during the working memory task compared to the resting state, while the opposite is true for imbalanced triads. The increase of balanced triads forced the network to a more stable state with a lower balance energy level. The increase of balanced triads was crucially related to changes in anti-synchrony to synchronous activities between the Temporal Cortex, the Prefrontal Cortex, and the Parietal Cortex, which are known to be involved in various aspects of working memory, during the working memory process. We hope these findings pave the way to a better understanding the working memory process.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Vision-brain understanding aims to extract semantic information about brain signals from human perceptions. Existing deep learning methods for vision-brain understanding are usually introduced in a traditional learning paradigm missing the ability to learn the connectivities between brain regions. Meanwhile, the quantum computing theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the connectivities in the brain signals and the entanglement properties in quantum computing, we propose a novel Quantum-Brain approach, a quantum-inspired neural network, to tackle the vision-brain understanding problem. To compute the connectivity between areas in brain signals, we introduce a new Quantum-Inspired Voxel-Controlling module to learn the impact of a brain voxel on others represented in the Hilbert space. To effectively learn connectivity, a novel Phase-Shifting module is presented to calibrate the value of the brain signals. Finally, we introduce a new Measurement-like Projection module to present the connectivity information from the Hilbert space into the feature space. The proposed approach can learn to find the connectivities between fMRI voxels and enhance the semantic information obtained from human perceptions. Our experimental results on the Natural Scene Dataset benchmarks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Top-1 accuracies of 95.1% and 95.6% on image and brain retrieval tasks and an Inception score of 95.3% on fMRI-to-image reconstruction task. Our proposed quantum-inspired network brings a potential paradigm to solving the vision-brain problems via the quantum computing theory.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) enhances the interpretability of principal components (PCs) by imposing sparsity constraints on loading vectors (LVs). However, when used as a precursor to independent component analysis (ICA) for blind source separation (BSS), sPCA may underperform due to its focus on simplicity, potentially disregarding some statistical information essential for effective ICA. To overcome this limitation, a sophisticated approach is proposed that preserves the interpretability advantages of sPCA while significantly enhancing its source extraction capabilities. This consists of two tailored algorithms, dissociative PCA (DPCA1 and DPCA2), which employ adaptive and firm thresholding alongside gradient and coordinate descent approaches to optimize the proposed model dynamically. These algorithms integrate left and right singular vectors from singular value decomposition (SVD) through dissociation matrices (DMs) that replace traditional singular values, thus capturing latent interdependencies effectively to model complex source relationships. This leads to refined PCs and LVs that more accurately represent the underlying data structure. The proposed approach avoids focusing on individual eigenvectors, instead, it collaboratively combines multiple eigenvectors to disentangle interdependencies within each SVD variate. The superior performance of the proposed DPCA algorithms is demonstrated across four varied imaging applications including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) source retrieval, foreground-background separation, image reconstruction, and image inpainting. They outperformed traditional methods such as PCA+ICA, PPCA+ICA, SPCA+ICA, PMD, and GPower.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas jointly representing visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of early- and mid-level visual areas. RNC generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. A large portion of representational content was shared across areas, unique representational content increased with cortical distance, and we isolated the visual features determining these effects. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We apply the phenomenological renormalization group to resting-state fMRI time series of brain activity in a large population. By recursively coarse-graining the data, we compute scaling exponents for the series variance, log probability of silence, and largest covariance eigenvalue. The exponents clearly exhibit linear interdependencies, which we derive analytically in a mean-field approach. We find a significant correlation of exponent values with the gray matter volume and cognitive performance. Akin to scaling relations near critical points in thermodynamics, our findings suggest scaling interdependencies are intrinsic to brain organization and may also exist in other complex systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion is often described as something people 'feel' in their bodies. Embodied emotion theorists propose that this connection is not purely linguistic; perceiving an emotion may require somatosensory and motor re-experiencing. However, it remains unclear whether self-reports of emotion-related bodily sensations (i.e., 'lump in my throat') are related to neural simulations of bodily action and sensation or whether they can be explained by cognitive appraisals or the visual features of socioemotional signals. To investigate this, participants (N = 21) were shown arousing emotional images that varied in valence, complexity, and content while undergoing fMRI scans. Participants then rated the images on a set of emotion appraisal scales and indicated where, on a body map, they experienced sensation in response to the image. To derive normative models of responses on these scales, a separate larger online sample online (N = 56 - 128) also rated these images. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to compare the emotional content in the body maps with appraisals and visual features. A pairwise distance matrix between the body maps generated for each stimulus was then used in a whole brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis to identify brain regions which reflect the representational geometry of embodied emotion. This analysis revealed a network including bilateral primary somatosensory and motor cortices, precuneus, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between emotion and the body is not purely conceptual: It is supported by sensorimotor cortical activations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The observation of a resonance structure in the opening angle of the electron-positron pairs in the $^{7}$Li(p,\ee) $^{8}$Be reaction was claimed and interpreted as the production and subsequent decay of a hypothetical particle (X17). Similar excesses, consistent with this particle, were later observed in processes involving $^{4}$He and $^{12}$C nuclei with the same experimental technique. The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target. The $\gamma$ and the e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair emerging from the $^8\mathrm{Be}^*$ transitions were studied with calorimeters and a spectrometer, featuring a broader angular acceptance than previous experiments. We present in this paper the analysis of a four-week data-taking in 2023 with a beam energy of 1080 keV, resulting in the excitation of two different resonances with Q-value \SI{17.6}{\mega\electronvolt} and \SI{18.1}{\mega\electronvolt}. No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper introduces NeuGPT, a groundbreaking multi-modal language generation model designed to harmonize the fragmented landscape of neural recording research. Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F. It can also simulate brain signals, thereby serving as a novel neural interface.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

This makes combining datasets and building models with inductive biases difficult as most datasets use different scanners and the sensor arrays have a nonintuitive spatial structure. In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well. We show that this enables spatial inductive biases, spatial data augmentations, better interpretability, zero-shot generalisation between datasets, and data harmonisation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In recent years, interest in synthetic data has grown, particularly in the context of pre-training the image modality to support a range of computer vision tasks, including object classification, medical imaging etc. Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic samples, automatically produced by various generative processes, can replace real counterparts and yield strong visual representations. This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy.   We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition. Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures. To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training. Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos. The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes. Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Proton spot-scanning arc therapy (ARC) is an emerging modality that can improve the high-dose conformity to targets compared with standard intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). However, the efficient treatment delivery of ARC is challenging due to the required frequent energy changes during the continuous gantry rotation. This work proposes a novel method that delivers a multiple IMPT (multi-IMPT) plan that is equivalent to ARC in terms of biologically effective dose (BED).   Approach: The proposed multi-IMPT method utilizes a different subset of limited number of beam angles in each fraction for dose delivery. Due to the different dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR) in each fraction, we optimize biologically effective dose (BED) for OAR and the physical dose delivered for target in each fraction. The BED-based multi-IMPT inverse optimization problem is solved via the iterative convex relaxation method and the alternating direction method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-IMPT method is evaluated in terms of dose objectives in comparison with ARC.   Main results: Multi-IMPT provided similar plan quality with ARC. For example, multi-IMPT provided better OAR sparing and slightly better target dose coverage for the prostate case; similar dose distribution for the lung case; slightly worse dose coverage for the brain case; better dose coverage but slightly higher BED in OAR for the head-and-neck case.   Significance: We have proposed a multi-IMPT approach to deliver ARC-equivalent plan quality.   Keywords: biologically effective dose (BED), proton arc therapy</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generative models have proven to be very effective in generating synthetic medical images and find applications in downstream tasks such as enhancing rare disease datasets, long-tailed dataset augmentation, and scaling machine learning algorithms. For medical applications, the synthetically generated medical images by such models are still reasonable in quality when evaluated based on traditional metrics such as FID score, precision, and recall. However, these metrics fail to capture the medical/biological plausibility of the generated images. Human expert feedback has been used to get biological plausibility which demonstrates that these generated images have very low plausibility. Recently, the research community has further integrated this human feedback through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF), which generates more medically plausible images. However, incorporating human feedback is a costly and slow process. In this work, we propose a novel approach to improve the medical plausibility of generated images without the need for human feedback. We introduce IMPROVE:Improving Medical Plausibility without Reliance on Human Validation - An Enhanced Prototype-Guided Diffusion Framework, a prototype-guided diffusion process for medical image generation and show that it substantially enhances the biological plausibility of the generated medical images without the need for any human feedback. We perform experiments on Bone Marrow and HAM10000 datasets and show that medical accuracy can be substantially increased without human feedback.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of multimodal medical imaging can provide complementary and comprehensive information for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in clinical practice, since positron emission tomography (PET) is often missing, multimodal images might be incomplete. To address this problem, we propose a method that can efficiently utilize structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) image information to generate high-quality PET images. Our generation model efficiently utilizes pyramid convolution combined with channel attention mechanism to extract multi-scale local features in sMRI, and injects global correlation information into these features using self-attention mechanism to ensure the restoration of the generated PET image on local texture and global structure. Additionally, we introduce additional loss functions to guide the generation model in producing higher-quality PET images. Through experiments conducted on publicly available ADNI databases, the generated images outperform previous research methods in various performance indicators (average absolute error: 0.0194, peak signal-to-noise ratio: 29.65, structural similarity: 0.9486) and are close to real images. In promoting AD diagnosis, the generated images combined with their corresponding sMRI also showed excellent performance in AD diagnosis tasks (classification accuracy: 94.21 %), and outperformed previous research methods of the same type. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other competing methods in quantitative metrics, qualitative visualization, and evaluation criteria.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Segmenting 3D blood vessels is a critical yet challenging task in medical image analysis. This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Across all fields of academic study, experts cite their sources when sharing information. While large language models (LLMs) excel at synthesizing information, they do not provide reliable citation to sources, making it difficult to trace and verify the origins of the information they present. In contrast, search engines make sources readily accessible to users and place the burden of synthesizing information on the user. Through a survey, we find that users prefer search engines over LLMs for high-stakes queries, where concerns regarding information provenance outweigh the perceived utility of LLM responses. To examine the interplay between verifiability and utility of information-sharing tools, we introduce the extractive-abstractive spectrum, in which search engines and LLMs are extreme endpoints encapsulating multiple unexplored intermediate operating points. Search engines are extractive because they respond to queries with snippets of sources with links (citations) to the original webpages. LLMs are abstractive because they address queries with answers that synthesize and logically transform relevant information from training and in-context sources without reliable citation. We define five operating points that span the extractive-abstractive spectrum and conduct human evaluations on seven systems across four diverse query distributions that reflect real-world QA settings: web search, language simplification, multi-step reasoning, and medical advice. As outputs become more abstractive, we find that perceived utility improves by as much as 200%, while the proportion of properly cited sentences decreases by as much as 50% and users take up to 3 times as long to verify cited information. Our findings recommend distinct operating points for domain-specific LLM systems and our failure analysis informs approaches to high-utility LLM systems that empower users to verify information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Among various spatio-temporal prediction tasks, epidemic forecasting plays a critical role in public health management. Recent studies have demonstrated the strong potential of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) in extracting heterogeneous spatio-temporal patterns for epidemic forecasting. However, most of these methods bear an over-simplified assumption that two locations (e.g., cities) with similar observed features in previous time steps will develop similar infection numbers in the future. In fact, for any epidemic disease, there exists strong heterogeneity of its intrinsic evolution mechanisms across geolocation and time, which can eventually lead to diverged infection numbers in two ``similar'' locations. However, such mechanistic heterogeneity is non-trivial to be captured due to the existence of numerous influencing factors like medical resource accessibility, virus mutations, mobility patterns, etc., most of which are spatio-temporal yet unreachable or even unobservable. To address this challenge, we propose a Heterogeneous Epidemic-Aware Transmission Graph Neural Network (HeatGNN), a novel epidemic forecasting framework. By binding the epidemiology mechanistic model into a GNN, HeatGNN learns epidemiology-informed location embeddings of different locations that reflect their own transmission mechanisms over time. With the time-varying mechanistic affinity graphs computed with the epidemiology-informed location embeddings, a heterogeneous transmission graph network is designed to encode the mechanistic heterogeneity among locations, providing additional predictive signals to facilitate accurate forecasting. Experiments on three benchmark datasets have revealed that HeatGNN outperforms various strong baselines. Moreover, our efficiency analysis verifies the real-world practicality of HeatGNN on datasets of different sizes.</td>
