<td style='padding: 4px;'>Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are running into limitations in terms of training time and energy. Following the principles of the human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning offer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of spiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here we study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and experimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a superconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically hold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning can be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in accordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find excellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the pulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power dissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per learning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and energy-efficient learning processor.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce GPTQv2, a novel finetuning-free quantization method for compressing large-scale transformer architectures. Unlike the previous GPTQ method, which independently calibrates each layer, we always match the quantized layer's output to the exact output in the full-precision model, resulting in a scheme that we call asymmetric calibration. Such a scheme can effectively reduce the quantization error accumulated in previous layers. We analyze this problem using optimal brain compression to derive a close-formed solution. The new solution explicitly minimizes the quantization error as well as the accumulated asymmetry error. Furthermore, we utilize various techniques to parallelize the solution calculation, including channel parallelization, neuron decomposition, and Cholesky reformulation for matrix fusion. As a result, GPTQv2 is easy to implement, simply using 20 more lines of code than GPTQ but improving its performance under low-bit quantization. Remarkably, on a single GPU, we quantize a 405B language transformer as well as EVA-02 the rank first vision transformer that achieves 90% pretraining Imagenet accuracy. Code is available at github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/GPTQv2.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A Literature Review of Reservoir Computing.   Even before Artificial Intelligence was its own field of computational science, humanity has tried to mimic the activity of the human brain. In the early 1940s the first artificial neuron models were created as purely mathematical concepts. Over the years, ideas from neuroscience and computer science were used to develop the modern Neural Network. The interest in these models rose quickly but fell when they failed to be successfully applied to practical applications, and rose again in the late 2000s with the drastic increase in computing power, notably in the field of natural language processing, for example with the state-of-the-art speech recognizer making heavy use of deep neural networks.   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a class of neural networks with cycles in the network, exacerbates the difficulties of traditional neural nets. Slow convergence limiting the use to small networks, and difficulty to train through gradient-descent methods because of the recurrent dynamics have hindered research on RNNs, yet their biological plausibility and their capability to model dynamical systems over simple functions makes then interesting for computational researchers.   Reservoir Computing emerges as a solution to these problems that RNNs traditionally face. Promising to be both theoretically sound and computationally fast, Reservoir Computing has already been applied successfully to numerous fields: natural language processing, computational biology and neuroscience, robotics, even physics. This survey will explore the history and appeal of both traditional feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, before describing the theory and models of this new reservoir computing paradigm. Finally recent papers using reservoir computing in a variety of scientific fields will be reviewed.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cerebral blood flow regulation is critical for brain function, and its disruption is implicated in various neurological disorders. Many existing models do not fully capture the complex, multiscale interactions among neuronal activity, astrocytic signaling, and vascular dynamics--especially in key brainstem regions. In this work, we present a 3D-1D-0D multiscale computational framework for modeling the neuro-glial-vascular unit (NGVU) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Our approach integrates a quadripartite synapse model--which represents the interplay among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells--with a hierarchical description of vascular dynamics that couples a three-dimensional microcirculatory network with a one-dimensional macrocirculatory representation and a zero-dimensional synaptic component. By linking neuronal spiking, astrocytic calcium and gliotransmitter signaling, and vascular tone regulation, our model reproduces key features of functional hyperemia and elucidates the feedback loops that help maintain cerebral blood flow. Simulation results demonstrate that neurotransmitter release triggers astrocytic responses that modulate vessel radius to optimize oxygen and nutrient delivery. This integrated framework, to our knowledge the first model to combine these elements for the NGVU in the DVC, provides a robust and modular platform for future investigations into the pathophysiology of cerebral blood flow regulation and its role in autonomic control, including the regulation of stomach function.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Ultrasound is a widely accessible and cost-effective medical imaging tool commonly used for prenatal evaluation of the fetal brain. However, it has limitations, particularly in the third trimester, where the complexity of the fetal brain requires high image quality for extracting quantitative data. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior image quality and tissue differentiation but is less available, expensive, and requires time-consuming acquisition. Thus, transforming ultrasonic images into an MRI-mimicking display may be advantageous and allow better tissue anatomy presentation. To address this goal, we have examined the use of artificial intelligence, implementing a diffusion model renowned for generating high-quality images. The proposed method, termed "Dual Diffusion Imposed Correlation" (DDIC), leverages a diffusion-based translation methodology, assuming a shared latent space between ultrasound and MRI domains. Model training was obtained utilizing the "HC18" dataset for ultrasound and the "CRL fetal brain atlas" along with the "FeTA " datasets for MRI. The generated pseudo-MRI images provide notable improvements in visual discrimination of brain tissue, especially in the lateral ventricles and the Sylvian fissure, characterized by enhanced contrast clarity. Improvement was demonstrated in Mutual information, Peak signal-to-noise ratio, Fr\'echet Inception Distance, and Contrast-to-noise ratio. Findings from these evaluations indicate statistically significant superior performance of the DDIC compared to other translation methodologies. In addition, a Medical Opinion Test was obtained from 5 gynecologists. The results demonstrated display improvement in 81% of the tested images. In conclusion, the presented pseudo-MRI images hold the potential for streamlining diagnosis and enhancing clinical outcomes through improved representation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are a highly prevalent condition with heterogeneous outcomes between individuals. A key factor governing brain tissue deformation and the risk of mTBI is the rotational kinematics of the head. Instrumented mouthguards are a widely accepted method for measuring rotational head motions, owing to their robust sensor-skull coupling. However, wearing mouthguards is not feasible in all situations, especially for long-term data collection. Therefore, alternative wearable devices are needed. In this study, we present an improved design and data processing scheme for an instrumented headband. Our instrumented headband utilizes an array of inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a new data-processing scheme based on continuous wavelet transforms to address sources of error in the IMU measurements. The headband performance was evaluated in the laboratory on an anthropomorphic test device, which was impacted with a soccer ball to replicate soccer heading. When comparing the measured peak rotational velocities (PRV) and peak rotational accelerations (PRA) between the reference sensors and the headband for impacts to the front of the head, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0.80 and 0.63, and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 0.20 and 0.28, respectively. However, when considering all impact locations, r dropped to 0.42 and 0.34 and NRMSE increased to 0.5 and 0.41 for PRV and PRA, respectively. This new instrumented headband improves upon previous headband designs in reconstructing the rotational head kinematics resulting from frontal soccer ball impacts, providing a potential alternative to instrumented mouthguards.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early and accurate assessment of brain microstructure using diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is crucial for identifying neurodevelopmental disorders in neonates, but remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), motion artifacts, and ongoing myelination. In this study, we propose a rotationally equivariant Spherical Convolutional Neural Network (sCNN) framework tailored for neonatal dMRI. We predict the Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) from multi-shell dMRI signals acquired with a reduced set of gradient directions (30% of the full protocol), enabling faster and more cost-effective acquisitions. We train and evaluate the performance of our sCNN using real data from 43 neonatal dMRI datasets provided by the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Our results demonstrate that the sCNN achieves significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) and higher angular correlation coefficient (ACC) compared to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) baseline, indicating improved accuracy in FOD estimation. Furthermore, tractography results based on the sCNN-predicted FODs show improved anatomical plausibility, coverage, and coherence compared to those from the MLP. These findings highlight that sCNNs, with their inherent rotational equivariance, offer a promising approach for accurate and clinically efficient dMRI analysis, paving the way for improved diagnostic capabilities and characterization of early brain development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Driven by the growing demand for intelligent remote sensing applications, large artificial intelligence (AI) models pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and fine-tuned for downstream tasks have significantly improved learning performance for various downstream tasks due to their generalization capabilities. However, many specific downstream tasks, such as extreme weather nowcasting (e.g., downburst and tornado), disaster monitoring, and battlefield surveillance, require real-time data processing. Traditional methods via transferring raw data to ground stations for processing often cause significant issues in terms of latency and trustworthiness. To address these challenges, satellite edge AI provides a paradigm shift from ground-based to on-board data processing by leveraging the integrated communication-and-computation capabilities in space computing power networks (Space-CPN), thereby enhancing the timeliness, effectiveness, and trustworthiness for remote sensing downstream tasks. Moreover, satellite edge large AI model (LAM) involves both the training (i.e., fine-tuning) and inference phases, where a key challenge lies in developing computation task decomposition principles to support scalable LAM deployment in resource-constrained space networks with time-varying topologies. In this article, we first propose a satellite federated fine-tuning architecture to split and deploy the modules of LAM over space and ground networks for efficient LAM fine-tuning. We then introduce a microservice-empowered satellite edge LAM inference architecture that virtualizes LAM components into lightweight microservices tailored for multi-task multimodal inference. Finally, we discuss the future directions for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of satellite edge LAM, including task-oriented communication, brain-inspired computing, and satellite edge AI network optimization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can reduce seizure duration, but their precise modes of action are unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether ASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a shorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity patterns.   Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from 28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure occurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns (states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these to different ASM levels.   Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\beta$ = -0.033, p < 0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:   Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering unmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these 'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).   Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without taper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224% longer durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\beta$ = -0.049, p < 0.001).   Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress specific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and (ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight the complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized dosing strategies for epilepsy management. These findings may also have implications in understanding the effects of ASMs on cognition and mood.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that is one of the most common forms of dementia. It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has been remarkably popular in the recent decade. While its effect has been validated through behavioral studies and neuro-physiological measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related bio-signal analyses, its development and triggers remain a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that its triggers are highly linked with cyclic patterns: predictable patterns introduce relaxation while variations maintain intrigue. To validate this and further understand the impact of acoustic features on ASMR effects, we designed three distinct cyclic patterns with monophonic and stereophonic variations, while controlling their predictability and randomness, and collected ASMR triggering scores through online surveys. Then, we extracted cyclic features and carried out regression analysis, seeking an explainable mapping of cyclic features and ASMR triggers. We found that relaxing effects accumulate progressively and are independent of spatial orientation. Cyclic patterns significantly influence psychological and physical effects, which remain invariant with time. Regression analysis revealed that smoothly spread and energy-dense cyclic patterns most effectively trigger ASMR responses.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects around 65 million people worldwide. Detecting seizures quickly and accurately is vital, given the prevalence and severity of the associated complications. Recently, deep learning-based automated seizure detection methods have emerged as solutions; however, most existing methods require extensive post-processing and do not effectively handle the crucial long-range patterns in EEG data. In this work, we propose SeizureTransformer, a simple model comprised of (i) a deep encoder comprising 1D convolutions (ii) a residual CNN stack and a transformer encoder to embed previous output into high-level representation with contextual information, and (iii) streamlined decoder which converts these features into a sequence of probabilities, directly indicating the presence or absence of seizures at every time step. Extensive experiments on public and private EEG seizure detection datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing approaches (ranked in the first place in the 2025 "seizure detection challenge" organized in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders), underscoring its potential for real-time, precise seizure detection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, which can have severe long-term consequences if undetected and left untreated. Early detection is crucial and typically requires continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring in a hospital setting, which is costly, inconvenient, and requires specialized experts for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a new low-cost active dry-contact electrode-based adjustable EEG headset, a new explainable deep learning model to detect neonatal seizures, and an advanced signal processing algorithm to remove artifacts to address the key aspects that lead to the underdiagnosis of neonatal seizures. Methods: EEG signals are acquired through active electrodes and processed using a custom-designed analog front end (AFE) that filters and digitizes the captured EEG signals. The adjustable headset is designed using three-dimensional (3D) printing and laser cutting to fit a wide range of head sizes. A deep learning model is developed to classify seizure and non-seizure epochs in real-time. Furthermore, a separate multimodal deep learning model is designed to remove noise artifacts. The device is tested on a pediatric patient with absence seizures in a hospital setting. Simultaneous recordings are captured using both the custom device and the commercial wet electrode device available in the hospital for comparison. Results: The signals obtained using our custom design and a commercial device show a high correlation (>0.8). Further analysis using signal-to-noise ratio values shows that our device can mitigate noise similar to the commercial device. The proposed deep learning model has improvements in accuracy and recall by 2.76% and 16.33%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the developed artifact removal algorithm can identify and remove artifacts while keeping seizure patterns intact.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper addresses the problem of detecting change points in the spectral density of time series, motivated by EEG analysis of seizure patients. Seizures disrupt coherence and functional connectivity, necessitating precise detection. Departing from traditional parametric approaches, we utilize the Wold decomposition, representing general time series as autoregressive processes with infinite lags, which are truncated and estimated around the change point. Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals. The proposed method effectively identifies seizure onset in EEG data and extends to event detection in video data. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing techniques.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Virtual reality (VR) presents immersive opportunities across many applications, yet the inherent risk of developing cybersickness during interaction can severely reduce enjoyment and platform adoption. Cybersickness is marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work primarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and motion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the \emph{dynamic nature} of cybersickness while users experience and freely interact in VR. We propose a novel method to \emph{continuously} identify and quantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users' \emph{passively monitored} electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method estimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing techniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels in real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific calibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses the considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness research.</td>

We propose methods for examining news agreement and its relationship to theta band power in the parietal region, indicating a potential link between cortical activity and selective exposure. Our vision is interactive systems that detect selective exposure and provide alternative views in real time.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing challenge due to its increasing prevalence, complex pathology, and functional ramifications. Electroencephalography (EEG), when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), holds promise for monitoring disease progression, identifying sub-phenotypes, and personalizing treatment strategies. However, the effect of medication state on AI model learning and generalization remains poorly understood, potentially limiting EEG-based AI models clinical applicability. This study evaluates how medication state influences the training and generalization of EEG-based AI models. Paired EEG recordings were utilized from individuals with PD in both ON- and OFF-medication states. AI models were trained on recordings from each state separately and evaluated on independent test sets representing both ON- and OFF-medication conditions. Model performance was assessed using multiple metrics, with accuracy (ACC) as the primary outcome. Statistical significance was assessed via permutation testing (p-values<0.05). Our results reveal that models trained on OFF-medication data exhibited consistent but suboptimal performance across both medication states (ACC_OFF-ON=55.3\pm8.8 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\pm8.7). In contrast, models trained on ON-medication data demonstrated significantly higher performance on ON-medication recordings (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\pm7.1) but significantly reduced generalization to OFF-medication data (ACC_ON-OFF=76.0\pm7.2). Notably, models trained on ON-medication data consistently outperformed those trained on OFF-medication data within their respective states (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\pm7.1 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\pm8.7). Our findings suggest that medication state significantly influences the patterns learned by AI models. Addressing this challenge is essential to enhance the robustness and clinical utility of AI models for PD characterization and management.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining serves as a valuable technique for detecting specific antigens or proteins through antibody-mediated visualization. However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the rapid advancement of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, the volume of physiological data generated in related research and applications has grown significantly. Data is a critical resource in BCI research and a key factor in the development of BCI technology, making efficient storage and management of this data increasingly vital. In the realm of research, ample data can facilitate the development of novel algorithms, which can be more accurately validated. In terms of applications, well-organized data can foster the emergence of new business opportunities, thereby maximizing the commercial value of the data. Currently, there are two major challenges in the storage and management of BCI data: providing different classification storage modes for multi-modal data, and adapting to varying application scenarios while improving storage strategies. To address these challenges, this study has developed the NeuroStore BCI data persistence system, which provides a general and easily scalable data model and can effectively handle multiple types of data storage. The system has a flexible distributed framework and can be widely applied to various scenarios. It has been utilized as the core support platform for efficient data storage and management services in the "BCI Controlled Robot Contest in World Robot Contest."</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Patients with extreme forms of paralysis face challenges in communication, adversely impacting their quality of life. Recent studies have reported higher-than-chance performance in decoding handwritten letters from EEG signals, potentially allowing these subjects to communicate. However, all prior works have attempted to decode handwriting from EEG during actual motion. Furthermore, they assume that precise movement-onset is known. In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The large volume of electroencephalograph (EEG) data produced by brain-computer interface (BCI) systems presents challenges for rapid transmission over bandwidth-limited channels in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems traditionally used in medicine and designed to interact with the brain to record or stimulate neurons. Despite their benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on neurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In this context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt spontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition. Previous work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced number of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this limitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of the primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons, tested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting gratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus, also testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results, based on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the attacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and fixed events are the most robust. Although both attacks can significantly affect neural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal delays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many neurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO increased with the number of neurons attacked.</td>

However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</td>

Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</td>

This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Traditional causal connectivity methods in task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) face challenges in accurately capturing directed information flow due to their sensitivity to noise and inability to model multivariate dependencies. These limitations hinder the effective comparison of brain networks between cognitive states, making it difficult to analyze network reconfiguration during task and resting states. To address these issues, we propose BOLDSimNet, a novel framework utilizing Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) to measure causal connectivity and network similarity across different cognitive states. Our method groups functionally similar regions of interest (ROIs) rather than spatially adjacent nodes, improving accuracy in network alignment. We applied BOLDSimNet to fMRI data from 40 healthy controls and found that children exhibited higher similarity scores between task and resting states compared to adolescents, indicating reduced variability in attention shifts. In contrast, adolescents showed more differences between task and resting states in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN), reflecting enhanced network adaptability. These findings emphasize developmental variations in the reconfiguration of the causal brain network, showcasing BOLDSimNet's ability to quantify network similarity and identify attentional fluctuations between different cognitive states.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High spatial and temporal resolution, coupled with a strong signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), has made BOLD 7 Tesla fMRI an invaluable tool for understanding how the brain processes visual stimuli. However, the limited availability of 7T MRI systems means that most research relies on 3T MRI systems, which offer lower spatial and temporal resolution and SNR. This naturally raises the question: Can we enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of 3T BOLD fMRI data to approximate 7T quality? In this study, we propose a novel framework that aligns 7T and 3T fMRI data from different subjects and datasets in a shared parametric domain. We then apply an unpaired Brain Disk Schr\"odinger Bridge diffusion model to enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of the 3T data. Our approach addresses the challenge of limited 7T data by improving the 3T scan quality. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it on two distinct fMRI retinotopy datasets (one 7T and one 3T), as well as synthetic data. The results show that our method significantly improves the SNR and goodness-of-fit of the population receptive field (pRF) model in the enhanced 3T data, making it comparable to 7T quality. The codes will be available at Github.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A common assumption in Computational Linguistics is that text representations learnt by multimodal models are richer and more human-like than those by language-only models, as they are grounded in images or audio -- similar to how human language is grounded in real-world experiences. However, empirical studies checking whether this is true are largely lacking. We address this gap by comparing word representations from contrastive multimodal models vs. language-only ones in the extent to which they capture experiential information -- as defined by an existing norm-based 'experiential model' -- and align with human fMRI responses. Our results indicate that, surprisingly, language-only models are superior to multimodal ones in both respects. Additionally, they learn more unique brain-relevant semantic information beyond that shared with the experiential model. Overall, our study highlights the need to develop computational models that better integrate the complementary semantic information provided by multimodal data sources.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding visual experiences from brain activity is a significant challenge. Existing fMRI-to-video methods often focus on semantic content while overlooking spatial and motion information. However, these aspects are all essential and are processed through distinct pathways in the brain. Motivated by this, we propose DecoFuse, a novel brain-inspired framework for decoding videos from fMRI signals. It first decomposes the video into three components - semantic, spatial, and motion - then decodes each component separately before fusing them to reconstruct the video. This approach not only simplifies the complex task of video decoding by decomposing it into manageable sub-tasks, but also establishes a clearer connection between learned representations and their biological counterpart, as supported by ablation studies. Further, our experiments show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 82.4% accuracy for semantic classification, 70.6% accuracy in spatial consistency, a 0.212 cosine similarity for motion prediction, and 21.9% 50-way accuracy for video generation. Additionally, neural encoding analyses for semantic and spatial information align with the two-streams hypothesis, further validating the distinct roles of the ventral and dorsal pathways. Overall, DecoFuse provides a strong and biologically plausible framework for fMRI-to-video decoding. Project page: https://chongjg.github.io/DecoFuse/.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The correlation matrix is a central representation of functional brain networks in neuroimaging. Traditional analyses often treat pairwise interactions independently in a Euclidean setting, overlooking the intrinsic geometry of correlation matrices. While earlier attempts have embraced the quotient geometry of the correlation manifold, they remain limited by computational inefficiency and numerical instability, particularly in high-dimensional contexts. This paper presents a novel geometric framework that employs diffeomorphic transformations to embed correlation matrices into a Euclidean space, preserving salient manifold properties and enabling large-scale analyses. The proposed method integrates with established learning algorithms - regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering - and extends naturally to population-level inference of brain networks. Simulation studies demonstrate both improved computational speed and enhanced accuracy compared to conventional manifold-based approaches. Moreover, applications in real neuroimaging scenarios illustrate the framework's utility, enhancing behavior score prediction, subject fingerprinting in resting-state fMRI, and hypothesis testing in electroencephalogram data. An open-source MATLAB toolbox is provided to facilitate broader adoption and advance the application of correlation geometry in functional brain network research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain's complex nonlinear dynamics give rise to adaptive cognition and behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. These dynamics exhibit scale-free and multifractal properties, influencing the reconfiguration of neural networks. However, conventional neuroimaging models are constrained by linear and stationary assumptions, limiting their ability to capture these processes. Transformer-based architectures, known for capturing long-range dependencies, align well with the brain's hierarchical and temporal organization. We introduce Multi-Band Brain Net (MBBN), a transformer-based framework that models frequency-specific spatiotemporal brain dynamics from fMRI by integrating scale-free network principles with frequency-resolved multi-band self-attention. Trained on three large-scale neuroimaging cohorts (UK Biobank, ABCD, ABIDE) totaling 45,951 individuals, MBBN reveals previously undetectable frequency-dependent network interactions, shedding light on connectivity disruptions in psychiatric conditions (ADHD, ASD, depression). This validation shows robust generalizability and highlights core neural principles conserved across populations. MBBN achieves up to 30.59% higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the advantage of frequency-informed spatiotemporal modeling in capturing latent neural computations. MBBN's interpretability uncovers novel frequency-specific biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders, providing insights into the hierarchical organization of brain function. By offering an interpretable framework for spatiotemporal learning, MBBN provides insights into how neural computations underpin cognitive function and psychiatric vulnerability, with implications for brain decoding, cognitive neuroscience, and precision psychiatry.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity data with phenotypic textual descriptors (e.g., disease label, demographic data) holds significant potential to advance our understanding of neurological conditions. However, existing cross-modal alignment methods often lack interpretability and risk introducing biases by encoding sensitive attributes together with diagnostic-related features. In this work, we propose NeuroLIP, a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework. We introduce text token-conditioned attention (TTCA) and cross-modal alignment via localized tokens (CALT) to the brain region-level embeddings with each disease-related phenotypic token. It improves interpretability via token-level attention maps, revealing brain region-disease associations. To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance. Qualitative visualization of attention maps highlights neuroanatomical patterns aligned with diagnostic characteristics, validated by the neuroscientific literature. Our work advances the development of transparent and equitable neuroimaging AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for classifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training without direct data sharing. Model-heterogeneous FL (MHFL) extends this paradigm by allowing clients to train personalized models with heterogeneous architectures tailored to their computational resources and application-specific needs. However, existing MHFL methods predominantly rely on centralized aggregation, which introduces scalability and efficiency bottlenecks, or impose restrictions requiring partially identical model architectures across clients. While peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes server dependence, it suffers from model drift and knowledge dilution, limiting its effectiveness in heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedSKD, a novel MHFL framework that facilitates direct knowledge exchange through round-robin model circulation, eliminating the need for centralized aggregation while allowing fully heterogeneous model architectures across clients. FedSKD's key innovation lies in multi-dimensional similarity knowledge distillation, which enables bidirectional cross-client knowledge transfer at batch, pixel/voxel, and region levels for heterogeneous models in FL. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and model drift through progressive reinforcement and distribution alignment while preserving model heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on fMRI-based autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and skin lesion classification demonstrate that FedSKD outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous FL baselines, achieving superior personalization (client-specific accuracy) and generalization (cross-institutional adaptability). These findings underscore FedSKD's potential as a scalable and robust solution for real-world medical federated learning applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In daily life, we encounter diverse external stimuli, such as images, sounds, and videos. As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness. Finally, it identifies key challenges and proposes future research directions, offering valuable insights for the field.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</td>

In this work, we compute the monitoring edge-geodetic number efficiently for the following graph classes: distance-hereditary graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, bipartite permutation graphs, and strongly chordal graphs.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</td>

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</td>

However, these invasive devices entail risks inherent to neurosurgery. Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.</td>

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner has been shown to be more accurate than other medical devices in detecting mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely used non-invasive technique for monitoring cardiovascular health and various physiological parameters on consumer and medical devices. While motion artifacts are well-known challenges in dynamic settings, suboptimal skin-sensor contact in sedentary conditions - a critical issue often overlooked in existing literature - can distort PPG signal morphology, leading to the loss or shift of essential waveform features and therefore degrading sensing performance. In this work, we propose CP-PPG, a novel approach that transforms Contact Pressure-distorted PPG signals into ones with the ideal morphology. CP-PPG incorporates a novel data collection approach, a well-crafted signal processing pipeline, and an advanced deep adversarial model trained with a custom PPG-aware loss function. We validated CP-PPG through comprehensive evaluations, including 1) morphology transformation performance on our self-collected dataset, 2) downstream physiological monitoring performance on public datasets, and 3) in-the-wild performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial and consistent improvements in signal fidelity (Mean Absolute Error: 0.09, 40% improvement over the original signal) as well as downstream performance across all evaluations in Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Respiration Rate (RR), and Blood Pressure (BP) estimation (on average, 21% improvement in HR; 41-46% in HRV; 6% in RR; and 4-5% in BP). These findings highlight the critical importance of addressing skin-sensor contact issues for accurate and dependable PPG-based physiological monitoring. Furthermore, CP-PPG can serve as a generic, plug-in API to enhance PPG signal quality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>To investigate the anisotropic properties of biomaterials, two distinct classes are considered: polymer-based (e.g., cellulose in plants) and crystalline-based (e.g., enamel in teeth), each demonstrating distinct structural and functional characteristics. Four-angle polarization (4-pol.) spectral mapping of sub-1 {\mu}m bamboo slices was carried out in the mid-IR spectral range (2.5-20 {\mu}m) to reveal the 3D organization of the chemical bonding of cellulose using the key characteristic absorption bands associated with C-O-C and C-N vibrational modes. The longitudinal and transverse microtome slices revealed a switch between the presence and absence of dichroism in parenchyma cell walls and vascular bundles. The cell wall showed continuous alignment of the C-O-C stretching vibrational mode (8.6 {\mu}m/1163 cm-1) down to the pixel resolution of ~ 4 {\mu}m (the step size in imaging) in the transverse slice; the cell wall thickness is ~ 1 {\mu}m. Thin microtomed slices of a tooth were measured in transmission and reflection modes. The single-point reflection measurements, performed using two perpendicular orientations, revealed orientational anisotropy in the enamel, which was absent in the dentin region. High sub-diffraction limited lateral resolution was numerically validated using a simplified-model of a Gaussian beam reading out material pixels with a defined orientation of absorption. It is shown that the orientation of small ~ {\lambda}/10 ~ 1 {\mu}m objects can be revealed using a focal spot of ~ {\lambda}/NA ~ 20 {\mu}m, defining the diffraction limit for the objective lens with a numerical aperture NA ~ 0.5.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Leukemia is 10th most frequently diagnosed cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths worldwide. Realistic analysis of Leukemia requires White Blook Cells (WBC) localization, classification, and morphological assessment. Despite deep learning advances in medical imaging, leukemia analysis lacks a large, diverse multi-task dataset, while existing small datasets lack domain diversity, limiting real world applicability. To overcome dataset challenges, we present a large scale WBC dataset named Large Leukemia Dataset (LLD) and novel methods for detecting WBC with their attributes. Our contribution here is threefold. First, we present a large-scale Leukemia dataset collected through Peripheral Blood Films (PBF) from several patients, through multiple microscopes, multi cameras, and multi magnification. To enhance diagnosis explainability and medical expert acceptance, each leukemia cell is annotated at 100x with 7 morphological attributes, ranging from Cell Size to Nuclear Shape. Secondly, we propose a multi task model that not only detects WBCs but also predicts their attributes, providing an interpretable and clinically meaningful solution. Third, we propose a method for WBC detection with attribute analysis using sparse annotations. This approach reduces the annotation burden on hematologists, requiring them to mark only a small area within the field of view. Our method enables the model to leverage the entire field of view rather than just the annotated regions, enhancing learning efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. From diagnosis explainability to overcoming domain shift challenges, presented datasets could be used for many challenging aspects of microscopic image analysis. The datasets, code, and demo are available at: https://im.itu.edu.pk/sparse-leukemiaattri/</td>

For which reason might observations be inconsistent? This contribution intends to answer both questions by proposing a novel multi-group Gaussian mixture model that accounts for the given group context while allowing high flexibility. This is achieved by assuming that the observations of a particular group originate not from a single distribution but from a Gaussian mixture of all group distributions. Moreover, the model provides robustness against cellwise outliers, thus against atypical data cells of the observations. The objective function can be formulated as a likelihood problem and optimized efficiently. We also derive the theoretical breakdown point of the estimators, an innovative result in this context to quantify the degree of robustness to cellwise outliers. Simulations demonstrate the excellent performance and the advantages to alternative models and estimators. Applications from different areas illustrate the strength of the method, particularly in investigating observations which are on the overlap of different groups.</td>

However, CT multi-organ segmentation methods based on masked image modeling (MIM) are very limited. There are already methods using MAE for CT multi-organ segmentation task, we believe that the existing methods do not identify the most difficult areas to reconstruct. To this end, we propose a MIM self-training framework with hard patches mining masked autoencoders for CT multi-organ segmentation tasks (selfMedHPM). The method performs ViT self-pretraining on the training set of the target data and introduces an auxiliary loss predictor, which first predicts the patch loss and determines the location of the next mask. SelfMedHPM implementation is better than various competitive methods in abdominal CT multi-organ segmentation and body CT multi-organ segmentation.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an advanced extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) tailored for the medical field, offers a transformative solution for delivering medical care. IoMT consists of interconnected medical devices that collect and transmit patients' vital signs online. This data can be analyzed to identify potential health issues, support medical decision-making, enhance patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare operations. Additionally, IoMT helps individuals make informed decisions about their health and fitness. There is a natural synergy with emerging communication technologies to ensure the secure and timely transmission of medical data. This paper presents the first comprehensive tutorial on cutting-edge IoMT research focusing on wireless communication-based solutions. It introduces a systematic three-tier framework to analyze IoMT networks and identify application scenarios. The paper examines the medical data transmission process, including intra-wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), inter-WBAN, and beyond-WBAN communications. It also discusses the challenges of implementing IoMT applications, such as the longevity of biosensors, co-channel interference management, information security, and data processing delays. Proposed solutions to these challenges are explored from a wireless communication perspective, and future research directions are outlined.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Ultrasound is a widely accessible and cost-effective medical imaging tool commonly used for prenatal evaluation of the fetal brain. However, it has limitations, particularly in the third trimester, where the complexity of the fetal brain requires high image quality for extracting quantitative data. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior image quality and tissue differentiation but is less available, expensive, and requires time-consuming acquisition. Thus, transforming ultrasonic images into an MRI-mimicking display may be advantageous and allow better tissue anatomy presentation. To address this goal, we have examined the use of artificial intelligence, implementing a diffusion model renowned for generating high-quality images. The proposed method, termed "Dual Diffusion Imposed Correlation" (DDIC), leverages a diffusion-based translation methodology, assuming a shared latent space between ultrasound and MRI domains. Model training was obtained utilizing the "HC18" dataset for ultrasound and the "CRL fetal brain atlas" along with the "FeTA " datasets for MRI. The generated pseudo-MRI images provide notable improvements in visual discrimination of brain tissue, especially in the lateral ventricles and the Sylvian fissure, characterized by enhanced contrast clarity. Improvement was demonstrated in Mutual information, Peak signal-to-noise ratio, Fr\'echet Inception Distance, and Contrast-to-noise ratio. Findings from these evaluations indicate statistically significant superior performance of the DDIC compared to other translation methodologies. In addition, a Medical Opinion Test was obtained from 5 gynecologists. The results demonstrated display improvement in 81% of the tested images. In conclusion, the presented pseudo-MRI images hold the potential for streamlining diagnosis and enhancing clinical outcomes through improved representation.</td>

In order to achieve an improved tradeoff between complexity and performance, we propose a new framework to improve the performance of low complexity models via knowledge distillation from multiple large medical foundation models (e.g., MedSAM, RAD-DINO, MedCLIP), each specializing in different vision tasks, with the goal to effectively bridge the performance gap for medical image segmentation tasks. The agglomerated model demonstrates superior generalization across 12 segmentation tasks, whereas specialized models require explicit training for each task. Our approach achieved an average performance gain of 2\% in Dice coefficient compared to simple distillation.</td>
