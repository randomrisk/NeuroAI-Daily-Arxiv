<td style='padding: 4px;'>If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this, in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs) is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional (e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g., affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied, and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients, but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models. Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts. Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1 score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce a probabilistic model of early visual processing, beginning with the interaction between a light wavefront and the retina. We argue that perception originates not with deterministic transduction, but with probabilistic threshold crossings shaped by quantum photon arrival statistics and biological variability. We formalize this with an uncertainty relation, \( \Delta \alpha \cdot \Delta t \geq \eta \), through the transformation of light into symbolic neural code through the layered retinal architecture. Our model is supported by previous experimental results, which show intrinsic variability in retinal responses even under fixed stimuli. We contrast this with a classical null hypothesis of deterministic encoding and propose experiments to further test our uncertainty relation. By re-framing the retina as a probabilistic measurement device, we lay the foundation for future models of cortical dynamics rooted in quantum-like computation. We are not claiming that the brain could be working as a quantum-system, but rather putting forth the argument that the brain as a classical system could still implement quantum-inspired computations. We define quantum-inspired computation as a scheme that includes both probabilistic and time-sensitive computation, clearly separating it from classically implementable probabilistic systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain networks typically exhibit characteristic synchronization patterns where several synchronized clusters coexist. On the other hand, neurological disorders are considered to be related to pathological synchronization such as excessive synchronization of large populations of neurons. Motivated by these phenomena, this paper presents two approaches to control the cluster synchronization and the cluster phase cohesiveness of Kuramoto oscillators. One is based on feeding back the mean phases to the clusters, and the other is based on the use of pacemakers. First, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster synchronization. Then, we propose a method to find optimal feedback gains through convex optimization. Second, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster phase cohesiveness. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions, Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential, making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG Source localization is a critical tool in neuroscience, with applications ranging from epilepsy diagnosis to cognitive research. It involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem that lacks a unique solution unless constrained by prior knowledge. The Bayesian framework enables the incorporation of such knowledge, typically encoded through prior models. Various algorithms have been proposed for source localization, and they differ significantly in how prior knowledge is incorporated. Some approaches rely on anatomical or functional constraints, while others use statistical distributions or sampling-based techniques. In this landscape, the Standardized Kalman Filter (SKF) represents a dynamic Bayesian approach that integrates temporal modeling with a Gaussian prior structure. It addresses the depth bias, a common limitation in source localization, through a post-hoc standardization step that equalizes sensitivity across cortical depths and makes deep activity detection feasible.   This study focuses on the development and optimization of Gaussian prior models within the SKF framework for simultaneous cortical and sub-cortical activity detection. Synthetic data similar to the P20 / N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) was used to identify effective prior parameter configurations for reconstructing both deep and superficial sources under different noise levels. We also investigated the role of RTS smoothing in enhancing source separability. Our results indicate that raising the standardization exponent to 1.25, along with smoothing, significantly improves depth localization accuracy at low noise levels.</td>

We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB. Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous EEG-fMRI applications.</td>

However, current BCI spellers often require users to type intended utterances letter-by-letter while spelling errors grow proportionally due to inaccurate electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding, largely impeding the efficiency and usability of BCIs in real-world communication. In this paper, we present MindChat, a large language model (LLM)-assisted BCI speller to enhance BCI spelling efficiency by reducing users' manual keystrokes. Building upon prompt engineering, we prompt LLMs (GPT-4o) to continuously suggest context-aware word and sentence completions/predictions during spelling. Online copy-spelling experiments encompassing four dialogue scenarios demonstrate that MindChat saves more than 62\% keystrokes and over 32\% spelling time compared with traditional BCI spellers. We envision high-speed BCI spellers enhanced by LLMs will potentially lead to truly practical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model (BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces training time without sacrificing performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments, including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait (FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective, data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables (age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only, descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets (BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively. In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal, attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal EEG channels and descriptive variables.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification, facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and generalized EEG models.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In multi-condition EEG experiments, brain activity is recorded as subjects perform various tasks or are exposed to different stimuli. The recorded signals are commonly transformed into time-frequency representations, which often display smooth variations across time and frequency dimensions. These representations are naturally structured as two-way functional data, with experimental conditions nested within subjects. Existing analytical methods fail to jointly account for the data's multilevel structure, functional nature, and dependence on subject-level covariates. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian mixed-effects model for two-way functional data that incorporates covariate-dependent fixed effects at the condition level and multilevel random effects. For enhanced model interpretability and parsimony, we introduce a novel covariate-dependent CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition for the fixed effects, with marginally interpretable time and frequency patterns. We further propose a sparsity-inducing prior for CP rank selection and an efficient algorithm for posterior sampling. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive simulations and applied to EEG data collected to investigate the effects of alcoholism on cognitive processing in response to visual stimuli. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns of time-frequency activity associated with alcoholism, offering new insights into the neural processing differences between subject groups and experimental conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers can render a new communication channel independent of peripheral nervous system, which are especially valuable for patients with severe motor disabilities. However, current BCI spellers often require users to type intended utterances letter-by-letter while spelling errors grow proportionally due to inaccurate electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding, largely impeding the efficiency and usability of BCIs in real-world communication. In this paper, we present MindChat, a large language model (LLM)-assisted BCI speller to enhance BCI spelling efficiency by reducing users' manual keystrokes. Building upon prompt engineering, we prompt LLMs (GPT-4o) to continuously suggest context-aware word and sentence completions/predictions during spelling. Online copy-spelling experiments encompassing four dialogue scenarios demonstrate that MindChat saves more than 62\% keystrokes and over 32\% spelling time compared with traditional BCI spellers. We envision high-speed BCI spellers enhanced by LLMs will potentially lead to truly practical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model (BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces training time without sacrificing performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, noise presents a persistent challenge, often compromising the quality of EEG signals essential for accurate data interpretation. This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for achieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address the issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by non-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line interference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of problematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting (ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify channels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR topographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the impact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery (MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%] (confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions), significantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]). These results underscore the critical role of channel selection and the potential of using blink patterns for detecting bad EEG channels, offering valuable insights for improving real-time or offline BCI systems by reducing noise and enhancing signal quality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices. Current visual BCI systems suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use. Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50% over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding 200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and 103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm. This study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of high-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli.</td>

These maps heavily rely on automated methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678 research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They also offer new insights into emerging trends within the BCI-XR field. The source code is available https://github.com/AryaAftab/RATE</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the human brain encodes and processes external visual stimuli has been a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. With advancements in artificial intelligence, sophisticated visual decoding architectures have achieved remarkable success in fMRI research, enabling more precise and fine-grained spatial concept localization. This has provided new tools for exploring the spatial representation of concepts in the brain. However, despite the millisecond-scale temporal resolution of EEG, which offers unparalleled advantages in tracking the dynamic evolution of cognitive processes, the temporal dynamics of neural representations based on EEG remain underexplored. This is primarily due to EEG's inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and its complex spatiotemporal coupling characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates advanced neural decoding algorithms to systematically investigate how low-dimensional object properties are temporally encoded in EEG signals. We are the first to attempt to identify the specificity and prototypical temporal characteristics of concepts within temporal distributions. Our framework not only enhances the interpretability of neural representations but also provides new insights into visual decoding in brain-computer interfaces (BCI).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs) is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional (e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g., affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied, and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients, but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models. Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts. Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1 score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity -- remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning. Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB. Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to interpret.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices. Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain. Our code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/algonauts-2025.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared representational format between vision and language remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting functional organization.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.   Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.   This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction, ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex. Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample composition.</td>

Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces. In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology (PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and 3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.   Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks.   This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections. For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.</td>

The method addresses key limitations in HSI segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative porcine hyperspectral dataset.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted.   The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics, muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics. Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However, these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.</td>
