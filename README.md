<td style='padding: 4px;'>We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance. Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge in sentential RE.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.   We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks. Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).</td>

We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine learning EEG analysis.   Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.   Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and requires fewer segments.   Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning models for medical image analysis often suffer from performance degradation when applied to data from different scanners or protocols, a phenomenon known as domain shift. This study investigates this challenge in the context of sex classification from 3D T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using the IXI and OASIS3 datasets. While models achieved high within-domain accuracy (around 0.95) when trained and tested on a single dataset (IXI or OASIS3), we demonstrate a significant performance drop to chance level (about 0.50) when models trained on one dataset are tested on the other, highlighting the presence of a strong domain shift. To address this, we employed the ComBat harmonization technique to align the feature distributions of the two datasets. We evaluated three state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures (3D ResNet18, 3D DenseNet, and 3D EfficientNet) across multiple training strategies. Our results show that ComBat harmonization effectively reduces the domain shift, leading to a substantial improvement in cross-domain classification performance. For instance, the cross-domain balanced accuracy of our best model (ResNet18 3D with Attention) improved from approximately 0.50 (chance level) to 0.61 after harmonization. t-SNE visualization of extracted features provides clear qualitative evidence of the reduced domain discrepancy post-harmonization. This work underscores the critical importance of domain adaptation techniques for building robust and generalizable neuroimaging AI models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant challenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both long-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness. Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor (Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner. This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization. Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark, CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art among open-source models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks, particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured when time series signals are used as input.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation. These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable, multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires $143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems. Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.</td>

Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</td>

Crucially, our data was recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k, around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale, cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of effective deep neural models of visual cognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks. Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.   A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs.   To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials).   We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code. Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However, no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays (0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects. Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms) for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation strategies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models are poised to significantly advance brain signal analysis by learning robust representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. However, their rapid proliferation has outpaced the development of standardized evaluation benchmarks, which complicates direct model comparisons and hinders systematic scientific progress. This fragmentation fosters scientific inefficiency and obscures genuine architectural advancements. To address this critical gap, we introduce EEG-FM-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for the systematic and standardized evaluation of EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we curate a diverse suite of downstream tasks and datasets from canonical EEG paradigms, implementing standardized processing and evaluation protocols within a unified open-source framework; (2) we benchmark prominent state-of-the-art foundation models to establish comprehensive baseline results for a clear comparison of the current landscape; (3) we perform qualitative analyses of the learned representations to provide insights into model behavior and inform future architectural design. Through extensive experiments, we find that fine-grained spatio-temporal feature interaction, multitask unified training and neuropsychological priors would contribute to enhancing model performance and generalization capabilities. By offering a unified platform for fair comparison and reproducible research, EEG-FM-Bench seeks to catalyze progress and guide the community toward the development of more robust and generalizable EEG-FMs. Code is released at https://github.com/xw1216/EEG-FM-Bench.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural correlates of sensory imagery is crucial for advancing cognitive neuroscience and developing novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigms. This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\deg}C Hot, 20{\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a new large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as part of the THINGS initiative, comprising over 1.6 million visual stimulus trials collected from 20 participants, and totaling more than twice the size of the most popular current benchmark dataset, THINGS-EEG2. Crucially, our data was recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k, around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale, cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of effective deep neural models of visual cognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG + eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and accessibility.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show enormous potential for advancing personalized medicine. However, BCIs also introduce new avenues for cyber-attacks or security compromises. In this article, we analyze the problem and make recommendations for device manufacturers to better secure devices and to help regulators understand where more guidance is needed to protect patient safety and data confidentiality. Device manufacturers should implement the prior suggestions in their BCI products. These recommendations help protect BCI users from undue risks, including compromised personal health and genetic information, unintended BCI-mediated movement, and many other cybersecurity breaches. Regulators should mandate non-surgical device update methods, strong authentication and authorization schemes for BCI software modifications, encryption of data moving to and from the brain, and minimize network connectivity where possible. We also design a hypothetical, average-case threat model that identifies possible cybersecurity threats to BCI patients and predicts the likeliness of risk for each category of threat. BCIs are at less risk of physical compromise or attack, but are vulnerable to remote attack; we focus on possible threats via network paths to BCIs and suggest technical controls to limit network connections.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner. Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available on GitHub.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) read neural signals directly from the brain to infer motor planning and execution. However, the implementation of this technology has been largely limited to laboratory settings, with few real-world applications. We developed a bimanual BCI system to drive a vehicle in both simulated and real-world environments. We demonstrate that an individual with tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI participant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle in Michigan. Our first teledriving task relied on cursor control for speed and steering in a closed urban test facility. However, the final BCI system added click control for full-stop braking and thus enabled bimanual cursor-and-click control for both simulated driving through a virtual town with traffic and teledriving through an obstacle course without traffic in the real world. We also demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BCI-controlled driving. This first-of-its-kind implantable BCI application not only highlights the versatility and innovative potentials of BCIs but also illuminates the promising future for the development of life-changing solutions to restore independence to those who suffer catastrophic neurological injury.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</td>

This paper generalizes the flowering IOPP introduced in [DMR25] for some specific (2, n)-regular Tanner codes to a much broader variety of codes: any code with symbols indexed on the edges of a Cayley graph. The flowering protocol of [DMR25] had a soundness parameter much lower than the FRI protocol [BCI + 23], and complexity parameters that could compete with the FRI [BBHR18a]. The lower soundness and the absence of restriction on the base field may lead to other practical speedups, however the codes considered in [DMR25] have an o(1) minimum distance. The generalization proposed in this paper preserves the soundness parameter with a slight decrease of the complexity parameters, while allowing being applied on codes with constant rate and constant minimum distance thanks to the good expansion properties of some families of Cayley graphs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and adapt to complex AI systems.</td>

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction, constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity, alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based neuroimaging.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are known to exhibit long-range temporal dependencies that challenge traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed methodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI and offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory and brain development.</td>

As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences, targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image) using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional connectivity (FC) analysis of resting-state fMRI data provides a framework for characterizing brain networks and their association with participant-level covariates. Due to the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, standard approaches often average signals within regions of interest (ROIs), which ignores the underlying spatiotemporal dependence among voxels and can lead to biased or inefficient inference. We propose to use a summary statistic -- the empirical voxel-wise correlations between ROIs -- and, crucially, model the complex covariance structure among these correlations through a new positive definite covariance function. Building on this foundation, we develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that enables statistical inference on covariate effects on region-level connectivity. Simulation studies show calibrated uncertainty quantification, and substantial gains in validity of the statistical inference over the standard averaging method. With data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we show that autism spectrum disorder is associated with altered FC between attention-related ROIs after adjusting for age and gender. The proposed framework offers an interpretable and statistically rigorous approach to estimation of covariate effects on FC suitable for large-scale neuroimaging studies.</td>

It is a biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli. Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos; the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed 4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) experiments provide promising avenues to probe new physics contributions from extended neutrino sectors in beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. We consider a Left--Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) extended with three generations of sterile neutrinos to realize a double type-I seesaw mechanism for light neutrino mass generation. The double seesaw induces maximal lepton number violation in the right-handed sector and facilitates enhanced Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos, thereby leading to their dominant contributions in both cLFV and $0\nu\beta\beta$ processes. We perform a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space for new-physics contributions to the cLFV decay $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to $0\nu\beta\beta$, considering two different textures for the Dirac mass matrices: one proportional to the identity matrix and another fully determined by the model framework. A detailed analysis of the common parameter regions accessible to current experiments like KamLAND-Zen and LEGEND-200, and upcoming experiments, such as MEG-II and LEGEND-1000, is presented, underscoring the phenomenological relevance of this framework. Our results aim to provide optimistic benchmarks for future searches targeting right-handed current-mediated neutrino interactions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Single-channel SQUID system technology, operating at a noise level of 100s of aT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$, enables the non-invasive detection of synchronized spiking activity at the single-trial level via magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, when combined with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, the noise performance of the ultrasensitive MEG system can be greatly diminished. This issue negates some of the complementary qualities of these two recording methods. In addition, typical electrical components required for electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, a common method for evoking specific brain responses, are also observed to have a detrimental influence on ultra-low MEG noise performance. These effects are caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and typically preclude single-trial detection. This work outlines, how careful design allows a significant reduction of the impact of EMI when these different electronic systems are operated concurrently. This optimization enabled the simultaneous single-trial detection of synchronized spiking activity using these two highly sensitive recording modalities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cortical activity recorded through EEG and MEG reflects complex dynamics that span multiple temporal and spatial scales. Spectral analyses of these signals consistently reveal power-law behaviour, a hallmark of turbulent systems. In this paper, we derive a kinetic equation for neural field activity based on wave turbulence theory, highlighting how quantities such as energy and pseudo-particle density flow through wave-space (k-space) via direct and inverse cascades. We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain represents visual information is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show large room for improvement for the proposed method.</td>

We demonstrate that encoding a dataset information into disordered quantum many-body spin-glass problems, followed by a nonadiabatic evolution and feature extraction via measurements of expectation values, significantly enhances machine learning (ML) models. By analyzing the performance of our protocol over a range of evolution times, we empirically show that ML models benefit most from feature representations obtained in the fast coherent regime of a quantum annealer, particularly near the critical point of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the generalization of our technique by benchmarking on multiple high-dimensional datasets, involving over a hundred features, in applications including drug discovery and medical diagnostics. Moreover, we compare against a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art classical ML models and show that our quantum feature maps can enhance the performance metrics of the baseline classical models up to 210%. Our work presents the first quantum ML demonstrations at the quantum-advantage level, bridging the gap between quantum supremacy and useful real-world academic and industrial applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the 7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the accuracy of medical image segmentation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.</td>

We transformed the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss. Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training (supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks. This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated, including when the guidelines are updated.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.   This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.   The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.   The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.   The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.   The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.   The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.   The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.   This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.   The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Radiotherapy using very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams generated by a laser-plasma accelerator has garnered significant interest due to its dose distribution capabilities and potential to address limitations of traditional photon-based radiotherapy. To explore the feasibility of such approach, the presented study uses the parameters of OONA, the commercial <1.3\,J, <25\,fs pulse duration laser recently installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Through particle-in-cell simulations of laser-plasma interaction, realistic electron beams were obtained. After filtering and collimation with a beamline and arranging them into an array of pencil beams, their radiotherapeutic potential was investigated. GEANT4 simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition in water phantoms and heterogeneous phantoms with bone inserts, considering realistic beam parameters for laser-plasma accelerators. Multifield irradiation setup and the dose distribution at the isocenter through different incidence angles were studied, simulating an intensity-modulated delivery. Our findings demonstrate that polychromatic VHEE beams generated from laser-plasma accelerators, when collimated using a compact beamline of quadrupoles and dipoles, can deliver an on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity. This study highlights the transformative potential of laser-plasma accelerators in advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and clinical implementation.</td>
