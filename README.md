<td style='padding: 4px;'>Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that, even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift. Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying computation in the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision, their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets, which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the dynamics of molecular motor-driven transport into dendritic spines, which are bulbous intracellular compartments in neurons that play a key role in transmitting signals between neurons. We further develop a stochastic model of vesicle transport in [Park, Singh, and Fai, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 82.3 (2022), pp. 793--820] by showing that second-order moments may be neglected. We exploit this property to significantly simplify the model and confirm through numerical simulations that the simplification retains key behaviors of the original agent-based myosin model of vesicle transport. We use the simplified model to explore the vesicle translocation time and probability through dendritic spines as a function of molecular motor parameters, which was previously not practically possible.   Relevance to Life Sciences: We find that thinner dendritic spine geometry can greatly reduce the probability of vesicle translocation to the post-synaptic density. The cell may alter molecular motor parameters to compensate, but only to a point. These findings are consistent with the biological literature, where brain disorders are often associated with an excess of long, thin dendritic spines.   Mathematical Content: We use a moment-generating function to deduce that second-order moments in motor attachment times may be neglected, and therefore the first-order moment is a sufficient approximation. Using only the mean attachment times and neglecting the variance yields a tractable master equation from which vesicle mean first passage times may be computed directly as a function of geometry and molecular motor parameters.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain. However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function, surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF). In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images, incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy is an emerging, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated considerable potential in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have found that pulsed wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed. Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fine-grained account of functional selectivity in the cortex is essential for understanding how visual information is processed and represented in the brain. Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder-decoder transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a "digital twin" offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses about visual selectivity in the human brain - hypotheses that can guide future fMRI experiments.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors, comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple, foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling - performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically modulate detectability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.   To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.   We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent promising results in auditory attention decoding (AAD) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have motivated the exploration of cEEGrid, a flexible and portable ear-EEG system. While prior cEEGrid-based studies have confirmed the feasibility of AAD, they often neglect the dynamic nature of attentional states in real-world contexts. To address this gap, a novel cEEGrid dataset featuring three concurrent speakers distributed across three of five distinct spatial locations is introduced. The novel dataset is designed to probe attentional tracking and switching in realistic scenarios. Nested leave-one-out validation-an approach more rigorous than conventional single-loop leave-one-out validation-is employed to reduce biases stemming from EEG's intricate temporal dynamics. Four rule-based models are evaluated: Wiener filter (WF), canonical component analysis (CCA), common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian Geometry-based classifier (RGC). With a 30-second decision window, WF and CCA models achieve decoding accuracies of 41.5% and 41.4%, respectively, while CSP and RGC models yield 37.8% and 37.6% accuracies using a 10-second window. Notably, both WF and CCA successfully track attentional state switches across all experimental tasks. Additionally, higher decoding accuracies are observed for electrodes positioned at the upper cEEGrid layout and near the listener's right ear. These findings underscore the utility of dynamic, ecologically valid paradigms and rigorous validation in advancing AAD research with cEEGrid.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs. power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40 Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution. This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp type during planning using noninvasive EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition, a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level, fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\% for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple, foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling - performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically modulate detectability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments. Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings. EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy, achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural signal relevance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential technique for neuroscience research and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recently, large-scale EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain. However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge the gap between the two fields.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A fine-grained account of functional selectivity in the cortex is essential for understanding how visual information is processed and represented in the brain. Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder-decoder transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a "digital twin" offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses about visual selectivity in the human brain - hypotheses that can guide future fMRI experiments.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain decoding is a key neuroscience field that reconstructs the visual stimuli from brain activity with fMRI, which helps illuminate how the brain represents the world. fMRI-to-image reconstruction has achieved impressive progress by leveraging diffusion models. However, brain signals infused with prior knowledge and associations exhibit a significant information asymmetry when compared to raw visual features, still posing challenges for decoding fMRI representations under the supervision of images. Consequently, the reconstructed images often lack fine-grained visual fidelity, such as missing attributes and distorted spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose BrainCognizer, a novel brain decoding model inspired by human visual cognition, which explores multi-level semantics and correlations without fine-tuning of generative models. Specifically, BrainCognizer introduces two modules: the Cognitive Integration Module which incorporates prior human knowledge to extract hierarchical region semantics; and the Cognitive Correlation Module which captures contextual semantic relationships across regions. Incorporating these two modules enhances intra-region semantic consistency and maintains inter-region contextual associations, thereby facilitating fine-grained brain decoding. Moreover, we quantitatively interpret our components from a neuroscience perspective and analyze the associations between different visual patterns and brain functions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that BrainCognizer outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple evaluation metrics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for (i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions (BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and {Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically, when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks (including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examine functional connectivity (FC), or the statistical dependencies among distant brain regions. These analyses are typically exploratory, guiding future confirmatory research. In this work, we present an approach based on factor analysis (FA) that is well-suited to studying FC. FA is appealing in this context because its flexible model assumptions permit a guided investigation of its target subspace consistent with the exploratory role of connectivity analyses. However, applying FA to fMRI data poses three problems: (1) its target subspace captures short-range spatial dependencies that should be treated as noise, (2) it requires factorization of a massive spatial covariance, and (3) it overlooks temporal dependencies in the data. To address these limitations, we develop a factor model within the framework of functional data analysis--a field which views certain data as arising from smooth underlying curves. The proposed approach (1) uses matrix completion techniques to filter short-range spatial dependencies out of its target subspace, (2) employs a distributed algorithm for factorizing large-scale covariance matrices, and (3) leverages functional regression to exploit temporal dynamics. Together, these innovations yield a comprehensive and scalable method for studying FC.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central goal in many brain studies is the identification of those brain regions that are activated during an observation window that may correspond to a motor task, a stimulus, or simply a resting state. While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties, including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49) compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition to spanning large redshift ($0<z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges ($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood. We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.</td>

In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quantum-like modeling (QLM) - quantum theory applications outside of physics - are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on mental entanglement detection using the EEG/MEG technique.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.</td>

A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Informal caregiving often carries a significant emotional, physical, and financial toll, yet caregiver burden is often underrepresented in healthcare research and methods. Existing caregiver burden instruments, while valuable in clinical research, often lack compatibility with observational datasets regularly used in health services research and planning. This study introduces the Caregiver Burden Index (CareBI) developed for the National Study of Caregiving (NSOC), that can be used to represent caregiver burden in quantitative models and observational research studies. CareBI was developed and validated using a multistep process that included the identification and preparation of individual NSOC survey items, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, score estimation, interpretation, and external validation. The study used data from round 12 of the NSOC. CareBI represents three domains of burden: objective, subjective, and interpersonal, providing a comprehensive view of both the positive and negative aspects of caregiving. It also aligns with the Zarit Burden Interview, a widely used tool for prospectively assessing caregiver burden. Construct validity was assessed by comparing CareBI's relationship with caregiver and care recipient outcomes, as well as sensitivity to known burden-related risk and mitigation factors. Early findings affirm the scale's utility in categorizing low-, moderate-, and high-burden caregivers and guiding resource-oriented strategies. CareBI represents a reproducible tool for embedding caregiver metrics into health operations, predictive modeling, and public policy frameworks, and provides a template for applying operations research and industrial engineering methods to psychosocial measurement challenges in aging and long-term care.</td>

A robust measurement instrument is essential to correctly evaluate trust from a human-centered perspective. This paper describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument, which follows psychometric principles, and consists of a 16-items trust scale. The instrument was built explicitly for research in human-AI interaction to measure trust attitudes towards AI systems from layperson (non-expert) perspective. The use-case we used to develop the scale was in the context of AI medical support systems (specifically cancer/health prediction). The scale development (Measurement Item Development) and validation (Measurement Item Evaluation) involved six research stages: item development, item evaluation, survey administration, test of dimensionality, test of reliability, and test of validity. The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically measuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent, verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings, ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making, demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to generate 3D activity maps from two 2D planar images (anterior and posterior). The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as 177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate 3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT leveraging the pre-therapy information of the patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In recent years, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing cancer tissue samples, including patient-derived specimens, organoids, biopsies, and murine models. In this work, we highlight the current applications of deep tissue LSFM in oncology and illustrate its use across a variety of human cancer tissues, including - but not limited to - prostate and breast. Here, we discuss that the potential integration of advanced LSFM technologies into clinical workflows to enable high-throughput, three-dimensional imaging of intact cancer specimens. This approach holds significant potential to enhance diagnostic precision and provide novel insights into tumour architecture and morphology.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded, LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods: We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment, readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 % contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 % impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced AI agents into emergency response workflows.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on 249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics (For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization, demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70, 0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex, large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.</td>
