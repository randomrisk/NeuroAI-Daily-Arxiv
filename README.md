<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based scientific predictions.

Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding. We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250 micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS 2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data, which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma Segmentation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.</td>

Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recordings of brain activity, such as functional MRI (fMRI), provide low-dimensional, indirect observations of neural dynamics evolving in high-dimensional, unobservable spaces. Embedding observed brain dynamics into a higher-dimensional representation may help reveal functional organization, but precisely how remains unclear. Hamiltonian mechanics suggests that, by introducing an additional dimension of conjugate momenta, the dynamical behaviour of a conservative system can be formulated in a more compact and mathematically elegant manner. Here we develop a physics-informed, data-driven framework that lifts whole-brain activity to the complex-valued field. Specifically, we augment observed signals (generalized coordinates) with latent ``dark signals'' that play the role of conjugate momenta in a whole-brain Hamiltonian system. We show that the Hilbert transform provides an augmentation approach with optimal fitting accuracy within this framework, yielding a Schr\"odinger-like equation governing complex-valued, augmented brain dynamics. Empirically, this complex-valued model consistently outperforms its real-valued counterpart, improving short-horizon prediction in the linear regime (correlation 0.12$\to$0.82) and achieving superior fits under nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics (0.47$\to$0.88). The framework strengthens structure-function coupling, recovers hierarchical intrinsic timescales, and yields biologically plausible directed effective connectivity that varies systematically with age and reconfigures from rest to task via global rescaling plus targeted rewiring. Together, these results establish a principled, testable paradigm for network neuroscience and offer transformative insight into the spatiotemporal organization and functional roles of large-scale brain dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to $38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties, including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding speech from stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals has emerged as a promising direction for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Its clinical applicability, however, is limited by the inherent non-stationarity of neural signals, which causes domain shifts between training and testing, undermining decoding reliability. To address this challenge, a two-stage framework is proposed for enhanced robustness. First, a multi-scale decomposable mixing (MDM) module is introduced to model the hierarchical temporal dynamics of speech production, learning stable multi-timescale representations from sEEG signals. Second, a source-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) method performs entropy minimization to adapt the model to distribution shifts during inference. Evaluations on the public DU-IN spoken word decoding benchmark show that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in challenging cases. This study demonstrates that combining invariant feature learning with online adaptation is a principled strategy for developing reliable BCI systems.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital, yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions, working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive assessment at both levels.</td>

Eye-tracking (ET) systems are common communication tools in early LIS but become ineffective as oculomotor function declines. EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a non-muscular communication alternative, but delayed adoption may reduce performance due to diminished goal-directed thinking. This study presents a preliminary hybrid BCI framework combining ET and BCI to support a gradual transition between modalities. A group of five healthy participants tested a modified P300-based BCI. Gaze and EEG data were processed in real time, and an ET-BCI fusion algorithm was proposed to enhance detection of user intention. Results indicate that combining both modalities may maintain high accuracy and offers insights on how to potentially improve communication continuity for patients transitioning from LIS to CLIS.</td>

Using structured social interactions between participants, we demonstrate that CEBRA can learn meaningful representations of joint neural activity that captures individual roles (speaker-listener) and other behavioral metrics. Our approach to characterizing interactions, as opposed to individual neural responses to stimuli, addresses the key principles of foundational model development: scalability and cross-subject generalization, opening new directions for representation learning in social neuroscience and clinical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads, suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to -10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications, necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space, while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding speech from stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals has emerged as a promising direction for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Its clinical applicability, however, is limited by the inherent non-stationarity of neural signals, which causes domain shifts between training and testing, undermining decoding reliability. To address this challenge, a two-stage framework is proposed for enhanced robustness. First, a multi-scale decomposable mixing (MDM) module is introduced to model the hierarchical temporal dynamics of speech production, learning stable multi-timescale representations from sEEG signals. Second, a source-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) method performs entropy minimization to adapt the model to distribution shifts during inference. Evaluations on the public DU-IN spoken word decoding benchmark show that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in challenging cases. This study demonstrates that combining invariant feature learning with online adaptation is a principled strategy for developing reliable BCI systems.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces. The code and pre-trained weights will be released.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions, working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive assessment at both levels.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed far-field location through phase manipulation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) progressively lose voluntary motor control, often leading to a Locked-In State (LIS), or in severe cases, a Completely Locked-in State (CLIS). Eye-tracking (ET) systems are common communication tools in early LIS but become ineffective as oculomotor function declines. EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a non-muscular communication alternative, but delayed adoption may reduce performance due to diminished goal-directed thinking. This study presents a preliminary hybrid BCI framework combining ET and BCI to support a gradual transition between modalities. A group of five healthy participants tested a modified P300-based BCI. Gaze and EEG data were processed in real time, and an ET-BCI fusion algorithm was proposed to enhance detection of user intention. Results indicate that combining both modalities may maintain high accuracy and offers insights on how to potentially improve communication continuity for patients transitioning from LIS to CLIS.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others, current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery (MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability, and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework: MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2 percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control. These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recordings of brain activity, such as functional MRI (fMRI), provide low-dimensional, indirect observations of neural dynamics evolving in high-dimensional, unobservable spaces. Embedding observed brain dynamics into a higher-dimensional representation may help reveal functional organization, but precisely how remains unclear. Hamiltonian mechanics suggests that, by introducing an additional dimension of conjugate momenta, the dynamical behaviour of a conservative system can be formulated in a more compact and mathematically elegant manner. Here we develop a physics-informed, data-driven framework that lifts whole-brain activity to the complex-valued field. Specifically, we augment observed signals (generalized coordinates) with latent ``dark signals'' that play the role of conjugate momenta in a whole-brain Hamiltonian system. We show that the Hilbert transform provides an augmentation approach with optimal fitting accuracy within this framework, yielding a Schr\"odinger-like equation governing complex-valued, augmented brain dynamics. Empirically, this complex-valued model consistently outperforms its real-valued counterpart, improving short-horizon prediction in the linear regime (correlation 0.12$\to$0.82) and achieving superior fits under nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics (0.47$\to$0.88). The framework strengthens structure-function coupling, recovers hierarchical intrinsic timescales, and yields biologically plausible directed effective connectivity that varies systematically with age and reconfigures from rest to task via global rescaling plus targeted rewiring. Together, these results establish a principled, testable paradigm for network neuroscience and offer transformative insight into the spatiotemporal organization and functional roles of large-scale brain dynamics.</td>

The model was pretrained on two of the largest neuroimaging datasets to date, encompassing 64,594 T1-weighted structural MRI 3D volumes (~ 14 million images) and 70,933 functional MRI (fMRI) time series. BrainHarmonix is grounded in two foundational neuroscience principles: structure complements function - structural and functional modalities offer distinct yet synergistic insights into brain organization; function follows structure - brain functional dynamics are shaped by cortical morphology. The modular pretraining process involves single-modality training with geometric pre-alignment followed by modality fusion through shared brain hub tokens. Notably, our dynamics encoder uniquely handles fMRI time series with heterogeneous repetition times (TRs), addressing a major limitation in existing models. BrainHarmonix is also the first to deeply compress high-dimensional neuroimaging signals into unified, continuous 1D tokens, forming a compact latent space of the human brain. BrainHarmonix achieves strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder classification and cognition prediction - consistently outperforming previous approaches. Our models - pretrained on 8 H100 GPUs - aim to catalyze a new era of AI-driven neuroscience powered by large-scale multimodal neuroimaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models, TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to achieve biologically aligned representations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output. In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations, bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However, these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different object class sensitivities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Clustering algorithms became an essential part of the neurophysiological data analysis toolbox in the last twenty five years. Many problems, from the definition of cell types/groups based on morphological, molecular and physiological data to the identification of sub-networks in fMRI data, are now routinely tackled with clustering analysis. Since the datasets to which this type of analysis is applied tend to be defined in larger and larger dimensional spaces, there is a need for efficient and robust clustering methods in high dimension. There is also a need for methods that assume as little as possible about the clusters shape and size. We report here our experience with the ToMATo (Topological Mode Analysis Tool) algorithm. It is based on a definitely deep mathematical theory (algebraic topology), but its Python based open-source implementation is easily accessible to practitioners. We applied ToMATo to a problem we know well, spike sorting. Its capability to work in the ''native'' space of the data (no dimension reduction is required) is remarkable, as well as its robustness with respect to outliers (superposed spikes).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding visual information from time-resolved brain recordings, such as EEG and MEG, plays a pivotal role in real-time brain-computer interfaces. However, existing approaches primarily focus on direct brain-image feature alignment and are limited to single-task frameworks or task-specific models. In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quantum-like modeling (QLM) - quantum theory applications outside of physics - are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on mental entanglement detection using the EEG/MEG technique.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG) is gaining significant traction as a neuroimaging tool, with the potential for improved performance and practicality compared to conventional instrumentation. However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices. This represents a significant step on the path towards OPMs becoming the sensor of choice for MEG measurement.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We propose a novel quantile function-based approach for neuroimaging classification using Wasserstein-Fr\'echet regression, specifically applied to the detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on the MEG and MRI data. Conventional neuroimaging classification methods for mTBI detection typically extract summary statistics from brain signals across the different epochs, which may result in the loss of important distributional information, such as variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc. Our approach treats complete probability density functions of epoch space results as functional response variables within a Wasserstein-Fr\'echet regression framework, thereby preserving the full distributional characteristics of epoch results from $L_{1}$ minimum norm solutions. The global Wasserstein-Fr\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection. In practical applications, the test accuracy on unseen data from Innovision IP's dataset achieves up to 98\%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) experiments provide promising avenues to probe new physics contributions from extended neutrino sectors in beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. We consider a Left--Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) extended with three generations of sterile neutrinos to realize a double type-I seesaw mechanism for light neutrino mass generation. The double seesaw induces maximal lepton number violation in the right-handed sector and facilitates enhanced Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos, thereby leading to their dominant contributions in both cLFV and $0\nu\beta\beta$ processes. We perform a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space for new-physics contributions to the cLFV decay $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to $0\nu\beta\beta$, considering two different textures for the Dirac mass matrices: one proportional to the identity matrix and another fully determined by the model framework. A detailed analysis of the common parameter regions accessible to current experiments like KamLAND-Zen and LEGEND-200, and upcoming experiments, such as MEG-II and LEGEND-1000, is presented, underscoring the phenomenological relevance of this framework. Our results aim to provide optimistic benchmarks for future searches targeting right-handed current-mediated neutrino interactions.</td>

However, when combined with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, the noise performance of the ultrasensitive MEG system can be greatly diminished. This issue negates some of the complementary qualities of these two recording methods. In addition, typical electrical components required for electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, a common method for evoking specific brain responses, are also observed to have a detrimental influence on ultra-low MEG noise performance. These effects are caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and typically preclude single-trial detection. This work outlines, how careful design allows a significant reduction of the impact of EMI when these different electronic systems are operated concurrently. This optimization enabled the simultaneous single-trial detection of synchronized spiking activity using these two highly sensitive recording modalities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Interdisciplinary research is critical for innovation and addressing complex societal issues. We characterise the interdisciplinary knowledge structure of PubMed research articles in medicine as correlation networks of medical concepts and compare the interdisciplinarity of articles between high-ranking (impactful) and less high-ranking (less impactful) medical journals. We found that impactful medical journals tend to publish research that are less interdisciplinary than less impactful journals. Observing that they bridge distant knowledge clusters in the networks, we find that cancer-related research can be seen as one of the main drivers of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Using signed difference networks, we also investigate the clustering of deviations between high and low impact journal correlation networks. We generally find a mild tendency for strong link differences to be adjacent. Furthermore, we find topic clusters of deviations that shift over time. In contrast, topic clusters in the original networks are static over time and can be seen as the core knowledge structure in medicine. Overall, journals and policymakers should encourage initiatives to accommodate interdisciplinarity within the existing infrastructures to maximise the potential patient benefits from IDR.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise, patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework, covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities. These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior, which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives, highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in real-world clinical settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding inner-shell decay processes in heavy-element molecules is essential for unraveling x-ray-induced photodynamics and advancing molecular imaging techniques. In this study, we investigate the influence of atomic substitution on core-hole relaxation dynamics and molecular fragmentation in Br2 and IBr, initiated by x-ray absorption at the Br K-edge. Using a combination of X-ray/ion coincidence measurements and Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations, we track charge distribution and the kinetic energy release (KER) of fragment ions with a total charge from 2+ to 8+. For both molecules, the simulated KER values show good agreement with experiment across different fragmentation channels. Our comparison reveals that substituting Br with the heavier I atom in IBr has minimal impact on the inner-shell electronic decay process, but significantly influences nuclear motion, leading to slower dissociation, thereby a KER close to the Coulomb limit, an effect attributed to the atomic mass. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and nuclear effects in molecular fragmentation, particularly in heavy-element species, and provide new insights into medical therapies, structural biology, and astrophysics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.   We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors (58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%). Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task performance.   Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases), and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of 11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.   The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding framework boundaries for optimal deployment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions, frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information. This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose \textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making. Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence. We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average.</td>
