<td style='padding: 4px;'>This paper proposes a multilayer graph model for the community detection from multiple observations. This is a very frequent situation, when different estimators are applied to infer graph edges from signals at its nodes, or when different signal measurements are carried out. The multilayer network stacks the graph observations at the different layers, and it links replica nodes at adjacent layers. This configuration matches the Cartesian product between the ground truth graph and a path graph, where the number of nodes corresponds to the number of the observations. Stemming on the algebraic structure of the Laplacian of the Cartesian multilayer network, we infer a subset of the eigenvectors of the true graph and perform community detection. Experimental results on synthetic graphs prove the accuracy of the method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of ability of correctly detecting graph communities. Finally, we show the application of our method to discriminate different brain networks derived from real EEG data collected during motor imagery experiments. We conclude that our approach appears promising in identifying graph communities when multiple observations of the graph are available and it results promising for EEG-based motor imagery applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>For many years, designs for "Neuromorphic" or brain-like processors have been motivated by achieving extreme energy efficiency, compared with von-Neumann and tensor processor devices. As part of their design language, Neuromorphic processors take advantage of weight, parameter, state and activity sparsity. In the extreme case, neural networks based on these principles mimic the sparse activity oof biological nervous systems, in ``Spiking Neural Networks'' (SNNs). Few benchmarks are available for Neuromorphic processors, that have been implemented for a range of Neuromorphic and non-Neuromorphic platforms, which can therefore demonstrate the energy benefits of Neuromorphic processor designs. Here we describes the implementation of a spoken audio keyword-spotting (KWS) benchmark "Aloha" on the Xylo Audio 2 (SYNS61210) Neuromorphic processor device. We obtained high deployed quantized task accuracy, (95%), exceeding the benchmark task accuracy. We measured real continuous power of the deployed application on Xylo. We obtained best-in-class dynamic inference power ($291\mu$W) and best-in-class inference efficiency ($6.6\mu$J / Inf). Xylo sets a new minimum power for the Aloha KWS benchmark, and highlights the extreme energy efficiency achievable with Neuromorphic processor designs. Our results show that Neuromorphic designs are well-suited for real-time near- and in-sensor processing on edge devices.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective models of the human language system, with some models predicting most explainable variance of brain activity in current datasets. Even in untrained models, the representations induced by architectural priors can exhibit reasonable alignment to brain data. In this work, we investigate the key architectural components driving the surprising alignment of untrained models. To estimate LLM-to-brain similarity, we first select language-selective units within an LLM, similar to how neuroscientists identify the language network in the human brain. We then benchmark the brain alignment of these LLM units across five different brain recording datasets. By isolating critical components of the Transformer architecture, we identify tokenization strategy and multihead attention as the two major components driving brain alignment. A simple form of recurrence further improves alignment. We further demonstrate this quantitative brain alignment of our model by reproducing landmark studies in the language neuroscience field, showing that localized model units -- just like language voxels measured empirically in the human brain -- discriminate more reliably between lexical than syntactic differences, and exhibit similar response profiles under the same experimental conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our model's representations for language modeling, achieving improved sample and parameter efficiency over comparable architectures. Our model's estimates of surprisal sets a new state-of-the-art in the behavioral alignment to human reading times. Taken together, we propose a highly brain- and behaviorally-aligned model that conceptualizes the human language system as an untrained shallow feature encoder, with structural priors, combined with a trained decoder to achieve efficient and performant language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Video action recognition (VAR) plays crucial roles in various domains such as surveillance, healthcare, and industrial automation, making it highly significant for the society. Consequently, it has long been a research spot in the computer vision field. As artificial neural networks (ANNs) are flourishing, convolution neural networks (CNNs), including 2D-CNNs and 3D-CNNs, as well as variants of the vision transformer (ViT), have shown impressive performance on VAR. However, they usually demand huge computational cost due to the large data volume and heavy information redundancy introduced by the temporal dimension. To address this challenge, some researchers have turned to brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs), such as recurrent SNNs and ANN-converted SNNs, leveraging their inherent temporal dynamics and energy efficiency. Yet, current SNNs for VAR also encounter limitations, such as nontrivial input preprocessing, intricate network construction/training, and the need for repetitive processing of the same video clip, hindering their practical deployment. In this study, we innovatively propose the directly trained SVFormer (Spiking Video transFormer) for VAR. SVFormer integrates local feature extraction, global self-attention, and the intrinsic dynamics, sparsity, and spike-driven nature of SNNs, to efficiently and effectively extract spatio-temporal features. We evaluate SVFormer on two RGB datasets (UCF101, NTU-RGBD60) and one neuromorphic dataset (DVS128-Gesture), demonstrating comparable performance to the mainstream models in a more efficient way. Notably, SVFormer achieves a top-1 accuracy of 84.03% with ultra-low power consumption (21 mJ/video) on UCF101, which is state-of-the-art among directly trained deep SNNs, showcasing significant advantages over prior models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain transcriptomics provides insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the brain coordinates its functions and processes. However, existing multimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on imaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis of brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information between modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities between modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph attention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide transcriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain regional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal radiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular and imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to each RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention to fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding. Finally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is designed to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each modality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with brain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging modalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI). The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in identifying AD, EMCI, and LMCI compared to state-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yaolab-fantastic/TMM.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multisequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a reliable diagnosis in clinical applications through complementary information within sequences. However, in practice, the absence of certain MR sequences is a common problem that can lead to inconsistent analysis results. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework for synthesizing multisequence MR images, called Hybrid Fusion GAN (HF-GAN). We introduce a hybrid fusion encoder designed to ensure the disentangled extraction of complementary and modality-specific information, along with a channel attention-based feature fusion module that integrates the features into a common latent space handling the complexity from combinations of accessible MR sequences. Common feature representations are transformed into a target latent space via the modality infuser to synthesize missing MR sequences. We have performed experiments on multisequence brain MRI datasets from healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with brain tumors. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons. In addition, a detailed analysis of our framework demonstrates the superiority of our designed modules and their effectiveness for use in data imputation tasks.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The text to medical image (T2MedI) with latent diffusion model has great potential to alleviate the scarcity of medical imaging data and explore the underlying appearance distribution of lesions in a specific patient status description. However, as the text to nature image models, we show that the T2MedI model can also bias to some subgroups to overlook the minority ones in the training set. In this work, we first build a T2MedI model based on the pre-trained Imagen model, which has the fixed contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) text encoder, while its decoder has been fine-tuned on medical images from the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset. Its gender bias is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Toward this issue, we propose to fine-tune the T2MedI toward the target application dataset to align their sensitive subgroups distribution probability. Specifically, the alignment loss for fine-tuning is guided by an off-the-shelf sensitivity-subgroup classifier to match the classification probability between the generated images and the expected target dataset. In addition, the image quality is maintained by a CLIP-consistency regularization term following a knowledge distillation scheme. For evaluation, we set the target dataset to be enhanced as the BraST18 dataset, and trained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) slice-based gender classifier from it. With our method, the generated MR image can markedly reduce the inconsistency with the gender proportion in the BraTS18 dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate brain lesion delineation is important for planning neurosurgical treatment. Automatic brain lesion segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, neural network performance is constrained by the lack of large-scale well-annotated training datasets. In this manuscript, we propose a comprehensive framework to efficiently generate new, realistic samples for training a brain lesion segmentation model. We first train a lesion generator, based on an adversarial autoencoder, in a self-supervised manner. Next, we utilize a novel image composition algorithm, Soft Poisson Blending, to seamlessly combine synthetic lesions and brain images to obtain training samples. Finally, to effectively train the brain lesion segmentation model with augmented images we introduce a new prototype consistence regularization to align real and synthetic features. Our framework is validated by extensive experiments on two public brain lesion segmentation datasets: ATLAS v2.0 and Shift MS. Our method outperforms existing brain image data augmentation schemes. For instance, our method improves the Dice from 50.36% to 60.23% compared to the U-Net with conventional data augmentation techniques for the ATLAS v2.0 dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have progressed in tandem, each contributing to our understanding of the brain, and inspiring recent developments in biologically-plausible neural networks (NNs) and learning rules. Predictive coding (PC), and its learning rule, have been shown to approximate error backpropagation in a biologically relevant manner, with local weight updates that depend only on the activity of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Unlike traditional feedforward NNs where the flow of information goes in one direction, PC models mimic the brain more accurately by passing information bidirectionally: prediction in one direction, and correction/error in the other. PC models learn by clamping some neurons to target values and running the network to equilibrium. At equilibrium, the network calculates its own error gradients right at the location where they are used for weight updates. Traditional backprop requires the computation graph to be feedforward. However, the PC version of backprop does not have this requirement. Amazingly, no one has demonstrated the application of PC learning directly to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Hopfield networks (HNs) are RNNs that implement a content-addressable memory, learning patterns (or ``memories'') that can be retrieved from partial or corrupted patterns. In this paper, we show that a HN can be trained using the PC learning rules without modification. To our knowledge, this is the first time PC learning has been applied directly to train a RNN, without the need to unroll it in time. Our results indicate that the PC-trained HNs behave like classical HNs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>High-precision acquisition of dense-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is often impeded by the costliness and lack of portability of equipment. In contrast, generating dense-channel EEG signals effectively from sparse channels shows promise and economic viability. However, sparse-channel EEG poses challenges such as reduced spatial resolution, information loss, signal mixing, and heightened susceptibility to noise and interference. To address these challenges, we first theoretically formulate the dense-channel EEG generation problem as by optimizing a set of cross-channel EEG signal generation problems. Then, we propose the YOAS framework for generating dense-channel data from sparse-channel EEG signals. The YOAS totally consists of four sequential stages: Data Preparation, Data Preprocessing, Biased-EEG Generation, and Synthetic EEG Generation. Data Preparation and Preprocessing carefully consider the distribution of EEG electrodes and low signal-to-noise ratio problem of EEG signals. Biased-EEG Generation includes sub-modules of BiasEEGGanFormer and BiasEEGDiffFormer, which facilitate long-term feature extraction with attention and generate signals by combining electrode position alignment with diffusion model, respectively. Synthetic EEG Generation synthesizes the final signals, employing a deduction paradigm for multi-channel EEG generation. Extensive experiments confirmed YOAS's feasibility, efficiency, and theoretical validity, even remarkably enhancing data discernibility. This breakthrough in dense-channel EEG signal generation from sparse-channel data opens new avenues for exploration in EEG signal processing and application.</td>

This study investigates the impact of a system immersion of a driving simulator on the drivers' brain activity while operating a conditionally automated vehicle. Nineteen participants drove approximately 40 minutes while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We found a significant effect of the system immersion in the occipital and parietal areas, primarily in the high-Beta bandwidth. No effect was found in the Theta, Alpha, and low-Beta bandwidths. These findings suggest that the system immersion might influence the drivers' physiological arousal, consequently influencing their cognitive and emotional processes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Automated vehicles are pictured as the future of transportation, and facilitating safer driving is only one of the many benefits. However, due to the constantly changing role of the human driver, users are easily confused and have little knowledge about their responsibilities. Being the bridge between automation and human, the human-machine interface (HMI) is of great importance to driving safety. This study was conducted in a static driving simulator. Three HMI designs were developed, among which significant differences in mental workload using NASA-TLX and the subjective transparency test were found. An electroencephalogram was applied throughout the study to determine if differences in the mental workload could also be found using EEG's spectral power analysis. Results suggested that more studies are required to determine the effectiveness of the spectral power of EEG on mental workload, but the three interface designs developed in this study could serve as a solid basis for future research to evaluate the effectiveness of psychophysiological measures.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Speech decoding from EEG signals is a challenging task, where brain activity is modeled to estimate salient characteristics of acoustic stimuli. We propose FESDE, a novel framework for Fully-End-to-end Speech Decoding from EEG signals. Our approach aims to directly reconstruct listened speech waveforms given EEG signals, where no intermediate acoustic feature processing step is required. The proposed method consists of an EEG module and a speech module along with a connector. The EEG module learns to better represent EEG signals, while the speech module generates speech waveforms from model representations. The connector learns to bridge the distributions of the latent spaces of EEG and speech. The proposed framework is both simple and efficient, by allowing single-step inference, and outperforms prior works on objective metrics. A fine-grained phoneme analysis is conducted to unveil model characteristics of speech decoding. The source code is available here: github.com/lee-jhwn/fesde.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy searchers' Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an accuracy of 73.5% (SD 2.6%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of 90.1% (SD 22.1%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Motor imagery-based BCI systems have been promising and gaining popularity in rehabilitation and Activities of daily life(ADL). Despite this, the technology is still emerging and has not yet been outside the laboratory constraints. Channel reduction is one contributing avenue to make these systems part of ADL. Although Motor Imagery classification heavily depends on spatial factors, single channel-based classification remains an avenue to be explored thoroughly. Since Fisher's ratio and Pearson Correlation are powerful measures actively used in the domain, we propose an integrated framework (FRPC integrated framework) that integrates Fisher's Ratio to select the best channel and Pearson correlation to select optimal filter banks and extract spectral and temporal features respectively. The framework is tested for a 2-class motor imagery classification on 2 open-source datasets and 1 collected dataset and compared with state-of-art work. Apart from implementing the framework, this study also explores the most optimal channel among all the subjects and later explores classes where the single-channel framework is efficient.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>H&E-to-IHC stain translation techniques offer a promising solution for precise cancer diagnosis, especially in low-resource regions where there is a shortage of health professionals and limited access to expensive equipment. Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As brain-computer interfacing (BCI) systems transition from assistive technology to more diverse applications, their speed, reliability, and user experience become increasingly important. Dynamic stopping methods enhance BCI system speed by deciding at any moment whether to output a result or wait for more information. Such approach leverages trial variance, allowing good trials to be detected earlier, thereby speeding up the process without significantly compromising accuracy. Existing dynamic stopping algorithms typically optimize measures such as symbols per minute (SPM) and information transfer rate (ITR). However, these metrics may not accurately reflect system performance for specific applications or user types. Moreover, many methods depend on arbitrary thresholds or parameters that require extensive training data. We propose a model-based approach that takes advantage of the analytical knowledge that we have about the underlying classification model. By using a risk minimisation approach, our model allows precise control over the types of errors and the balance between precision and speed. This adaptability makes it ideal for customizing BCI systems to meet the diverse needs of various applications. We validate our proposed method on a publicly available dataset, comparing it with established static and dynamic stopping methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach offers a broad range of accuracy-speed trade-offs and achieves higher precision than baseline stopping methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Effective teaching relies on knowing what students know-or think they know. Revealing student thinking is challenging. Often used because of their ease of grading, even the best multiple choice (MC) tests, those using research based distractors (wrong answers) are intrinsically limited in the insights they provide due to two factors. When distractors do not reflect student beliefs they can be ignored, increasing the likelihood that the correct answer will be chosen by chance. Moreover, making the correct choice does not guarantee that the student understands why it is correct. To address these limitations, we recommend asking students to explain why they chose their answer, and why "wrong" choices are wrong. Using a discipline-trained artificial intelligence-based bot it is possible to analyze their explanations, identifying the concepts and scientific principles that maybe missing or misapplied. The bot also makes suggestions for how instructors can use these data to better guide student thinking. In a small "proof of concept" study, we tested this approach using questions from the Biology Concepts Instrument (BCI). The result was rapid, informative, and provided actionable feedback on student thinking. It appears that the use of AI addresses the weaknesses of conventional MC test. It seems likely that incorporating AI-analyzed formative assessments will lead to improved overall learning outcomes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Generating continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals through advanced artificial neural networks presents a novel opportunity to enhance brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. This capability has the potential to significantly enhance applications ranging from simulating dynamic brain activity and data augmentation to improving real-time epilepsy detection and BCI inference. By harnessing generative transformer neural networks, specifically designed for EEG signal generation, we can revolutionize the interpretation and interaction with neural data. Generative AI has demonstrated significant success across various domains, from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to content creation in visual arts and music. It distinguishes itself by using large-scale datasets to construct context windows during pre-training, a technique that has proven particularly effective in NLP, where models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks after extensive foundational training. However, the application of generative AI in the field of BCIs, particularly through the development of continuous, context-rich neural signal generators, has been limited. To address this, we introduce the Generative EEG Transformer (GET), a model leveraging transformer architecture tailored for EEG data. The GET model is pre-trained on diverse EEG datasets, including motor imagery and alpha wave datasets, enabling it to produce high-fidelity neural signals that maintain contextual integrity. Our empirical findings indicate that GET not only faithfully reproduces the frequency spectrum of the training data and input prompts but also robustly generates continuous neural signals. By adopting the successful training strategies of the NLP domain for BCIs, the GET sets a new standard for the development and application of neural signal generation technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering language from brain activity is a crucial task in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric. This improvement demonstrates the advancement of our model towards real-world applications and underscores its potential in advancing BCI research.

In this work, we utilized cBCI and designed a cooperative four-classes MI task to train the dyad. A humanoid robot would stimulate the dyad to conduct both left/right hand and tongue/foot MI. Single user was asked to conduct single MI task before and after the cooperative MI task. The experiment results showed that our training could activate better performance (e.g., high quality of EEG /MI classification accuracy) for the single user than single MI task, and the single user also obtained better single MI performance after cooperative MI training.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Image-to-fMRI encoding is important for both neuroscience research and practical applications. However, such "Brain-Encoders" have been typically trained per-subject and per fMRI-dataset, thus restricted to very limited training data. In this paper we propose a Universal Brain-Encoder, which can be trained jointly on data from many different subjects/datasets/machines. What makes this possible is our new voxel-centric Encoder architecture, which learns a unique "voxel-embedding" per brain-voxel. Our Encoder trains to predict the response of each brain-voxel on every image, by directly computing the cross-attention between the brain-voxel embedding and multi-level deep image features. This voxel-centric architecture allows the functional role of each brain-voxel to naturally emerge from the voxel-image cross-attention. We show the power of this approach to (i) combine data from multiple different subjects (a "Crowd of Brains") to improve each individual brain-encoding, (ii) quick & effective Transfer-Learning across subjects, datasets, and machines (e.g., 3-Tesla, 7-Tesla), with few training examples, and (iii) use the learned voxel-embeddings as a powerful tool to explore brain functionality (e.g., what is encoded where in the brain).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emphasis in the tensor literature on random embeddings (tools for low-distortion dimension reduction) for the canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition has left analogous results for the more expressive Tucker decomposition comparatively lacking. This work establishes general Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) type guarantees for the estimation of Tucker decompositions when an oblivious random embedding is applied along each mode. When these embeddings are drawn from a JL-optimal family, the decomposition can be estimated within $\varepsilon$ relative error under restrictions on the embedding dimension that are in line with recent CP results. We implement a higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) decomposition algorithm with random embeddings to demonstrate the practical benefits of this approach and its potential to improve the accessibility of otherwise prohibitive tensor analyses. On moderately large face image and fMRI neuroimaging datasets, empirical results show that substantial dimension reduction is possible with minimal increase in reconstruction error relative to traditional HOOI ($\leq$5% larger error, 50%-60% lower computation time for large models with 50% dimension reduction along each mode). Especially for large tensors, our method outperforms traditional higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and recently proposed TensorSketch methods.</td>

In this work, we therefore propose to use the brain activations recorded by fMRI to refine the often-used wav2vec2.0 model by aligning model representations toward human neural responses. Experimental results on SUPERB reveal that this operation is beneficial for several downstream tasks, e.g., speaker verification, automatic speech recognition, intent classification.One can then consider the proposed method as a new alternative to improve self-supervised speech models.</td>

Voxel hierarchy animation maps of positive graphs revealed abrupt changes in coreness k and kmaxcore, which we called mental state transitions. Afferent voxel capacities of the positive graphs also revealed transient modules composed of dominating voxels/independent components and their exchanges representing mental state transitions. Animation and quantification plots of voxel hierarchy and afferent capacity corroborated each other in underpinning mental state transitions and afferent module exchange on the positive directed functional connectivity graphs. We propose the use of spatiotemporal trajectories of voxels on positive dynamic graphs to construct hierarchical structures by k core percolation and quantified in- and out-flows of information of voxels by volume entropy/directed graphs to subserve diverse resting mental state transitions on resting-state fMRI graphs in normal human individuals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Identifying and reconstructing what we see from brain activity gives us a special insight into investigating how the biological visual system represents the world. While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Semantic information is vital for human interaction, and decoding it from brain activity enables non-invasive clinical augmentative and alternative communication. While there has been significant progress in reconstructing visual images, few studies have focused on the language aspect. To address this gap, leveraging the powerful capabilities of the decoder-based vision-language pretrained model CoCa, this paper proposes BrainChat, a simple yet effective generative framework aimed at rapidly accomplishing semantic information decoding tasks from brain activity, including fMRI question answering and fMRI captioning. BrainChat employs the self-supervised approach of Masked Brain Modeling to encode sparse fMRI data, obtaining a more compact embedding representation in the latent space. Subsequently, BrainChat bridges the gap between modalities by applying contrastive loss, resulting in aligned representations of fMRI, image, and text embeddings. Furthermore, the fMRI embeddings are mapped to the generative Brain Decoder via cross-attention layers, where they guide the generation of textual content about fMRI in a regressive manner by minimizing caption loss. Empirically, BrainChat exceeds the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods in the fMRI captioning task and, for the first time, implements fMRI question answering. Additionally, BrainChat is highly flexible and can achieve high performance without image data, making it better suited for real-world scenarios with limited data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The brain's complex functionality emerges from network interactions that go beyond dyadic connections, with higher-order interactions significantly contributing to this complexity. One method of capturing higher-order interactions is through traversing the brain network using random walks. The efficacy of these random walks depends on the defined mutual interactions between two brain entities. More precise capture of higher-order interactions enables a better reflection of the brain's intrinsic neurophysiological characteristics. One well-established neurophysiological concept is Homotopic Functional Connectivity (HoFC), which illustrates the synchronized spontaneous activity between corresponding regions in the brain's left and right hemispheres. We employ node2vec, a random walk node embedding approach, alongside resting-state fMRI from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to obtain higher-order feature vectors. We assess the efficacy of different functional connectivity parameterizations using HoFC. The results indicates that the quality of capturing higher-order interactions largely depends on the statistical dependency measure between brain regions. Higher-order interactions defined by partial correlation, better reflects HoFC compare to other statistical associations. In this case of first-order interactions, tangent space embedding more effectively demonstrates HoFC. The findings validate HoFC and underscore the importance of functional connectivity construction method in capturing intrinsic characteristics of the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>FMRI data are noisy, complicated to acquire, and typically go through many steps of processing before they are used in a study or clinical practice. Being able to visualize and understand the data from the start through the completion of processing, while being confident that each intermediate step was successful, is challenging. AFNI's "afni_proc.py" is a tool to create and run a processing pipeline for FMRI data. With its flexible features, "afni_proc.py" allows users to both control and evaluate their processing at a detailed level. It has been designed to keep users informed about all processing steps: it does not just process the data, but first outputs a fully commented processing script that the users can read, query, interpret and refer back to. Having this full provenance is important for being able to understand each step of processing; it also promotes transparency and reproducibility by keeping the record of individual-level processing and modeling specifics in a single, shareable place. Additionally, "afni_proc.py" creates pipelines that contain several automatic self-checks for potential problems during runtime. The output directory contains a dictionary of relevant quantities that can be programmatically queried for potential issues and a systematic, interactive quality control (QC) HTML. All of these features help users evaluate and understand their data and processing in detail. We describe these and other aspects of "afni_proc.py" here using a set of task-based and resting state FMRI example commands.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deciphering language from brain activity is a crucial task in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric. This improvement demonstrates the advancement of our model towards real-world applications and underscores its potential in advancing BCI research.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Growing interest and investment in the capabilities of foundation models has positioned such systems to impact a wide array of public services. Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the "foundation" layer, our framework proposes the "subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the "surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate "subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural environment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Centred Kernel Alignment (CKA) has recently emerged as a popular metric to compare activations from biological and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to quantify the alignment between internal representations derived from stimuli sets (e.g. images, text, video) that are presented to both systems. In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment.</td>

In this paper, we formally define and study the problem of identifying such minimal evidence groups (MEGs) for claim verification. We show that MEG identification can be reduced from Set Cover problem, based on entailment inference of whether a given evidence group provides full/partial support to a claim. Our proposed approach achieves 18.4% and 34.8% absolute improvements on the WiCE and SciFact datasets over LLM prompting.

We retrospectively analysed data from 17,(46) healthy controls and 22,(24) individuals with TLE who underwent scalp EEG and (MEG) recordings as part of presurgical evaluation. Resting-state, eyes-closed recordings were source reconstructed using the standardized low-resolution brain electrographic tomography (sLORETA) method. We extracted low (slow) 6-9 Hz and high (fast) 10-11 Hz alpha relative band power and calculated the alpha power ratio by dividing low (slow) alpha by high (fast) alpha. This ratio was computed for all brain regions in all individuals.   Alpha oscillations were slower in individuals with TLE than controls (p<0.05). This effect was present in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, and across widespread brain regions.   Alpha slowing in TLE was found in both EEG and MEG recordings. We interpret greater low (slow)-alpha as greater deviation from health.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning techniques can be used to first training unsupervised models on large amounts of unlabelled data, before fine-tuning the models on specific tasks. This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation. All code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricsinaruto/MEG-transfer-decoding).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: The integration of artificial intelligence into medicine has led to significant advances, particularly in diagnostics and treatment planning. However, the reliability of AI models is highly dependent on the quality of the training data, especially in medical imaging, where varying patient data and evolving medical knowledge pose a challenge to the accuracy and generalizability of given datasets. Results: The proposed approach focuses on the integration and enhancement of clinical computed tomography (CT) image series for better findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. Through an automated indexing process, CT image series are semantically enhanced using the TotalSegmentator framework for segmentation and resulting SNOMED CT annotations. The metadata is standardized with HL7 FHIR resources to enable efficient data recognition and data exchange between research projects. Conclusions: The study successfully integrates a robust process within the UKSH MeDIC, leading to the semantic enrichment of over 230,000 CT image series and over 8 million SNOMED CT annotations. The standardized representation using HL7 FHIR resources improves discoverability and facilitates interoperability, providing a foundation for the FAIRness of medical imaging data. However, developing automated annotation methods that can keep pace with growing clinical datasets remains a challenge to ensure continued progress in large-scale integration and indexing of medical imaging for advanced healthcare AI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Zero-shot text learning enables text classifiers to handle unseen classes efficiently, alleviating the need for task-specific training data. A simple approach often relies on comparing embeddings of query (text) to those of potential classes. However, the embeddings of a simple query sometimes lack rich contextual information, which hinders the classification performance. Traditionally, this has been addressed by improving the embedding model with expensive training. We introduce QZero, a novel training-free knowledge augmentation approach that reformulates queries by retrieving supporting categories from Wikipedia to improve zero-shot text classification performance. Our experiments across six diverse datasets demonstrate that QZero enhances performance for state-of-the-art static and contextual embedding models without the need for retraining. Notably, in News and medical topic classification tasks, QZero improves the performance of even the largest OpenAI embedding model by at least 5% and 3%, respectively. Acting as a knowledge amplifier, QZero enables small word embedding models to achieve performance levels comparable to those of larger contextual models, offering the potential for significant computational savings. Additionally, QZero offers meaningful insights that illuminate query context and verify topic relevance, aiding in understanding model predictions. Overall, QZero improves embedding-based zero-shot classifiers while maintaining their simplicity. This makes it particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments and domains with constantly evolving information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, performed fractionally (e.g., daily or weekly), are widely utilized for patient alignment in the image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) process, thereby making it a potential imaging modality for the implementation of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) protocols. Nonetheless, significant artifacts and incorrect Hounsfield unit (HU) values hinder their application in quantitative tasks such as target and organ segmentations and dose calculation. Therefore, acquiring CT-quality images from the CBCT scans is essential to implement online ART in clinical settings.   Purpose: This work aims to develop an unsupervised learning method using the patient-specific diffusion model for CBCT-based synthetic CT (sCT) generation to improve the image quality of CBCT.   Methods: The proposed method is in an unsupervised framework that utilizes a patient-specific score-based model as the image prior alongside a customized total variation (TV) regularization to enforce coherence across different transverse slices. The score-based model is unconditionally trained using the same patient's planning CT (pCT) images to characterize the manifold of CT-quality images and capture the unique anatomical information of the specific patient. The efficacy of the proposed method was assessed on images from anatomical sites including head and neck (H&N) cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. The performance of the proposed CBCT correction method was evaluated using quantitative metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Additionally, the proposed algorithm was benchmarked against two other unsupervised diffusion model-based CBCT correction algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the field of medical imaging, particularly in tasks related to early disease detection and prognosis, understanding the reasoning behind AI model predictions is imperative for assessing their reliability. Conventional explanation methods encounter challenges in identifying decisive features in medical image classifications, especially when discriminative features are subtle or not immediately evident. To address this limitation, we propose an agent model capable of generating counterfactual images that prompt different decisions when plugged into a black box model. By employing this agent model, we can uncover influential image patterns that impact the black model's final predictions. Through our methodology, we efficiently identify features that influence decisions of the deep black box. We validated our approach in the rigorous domain of medical prognosis tasks, showcasing its efficacy and potential to enhance the reliability of deep learning models in medical image classification compared to existing interpretation methods.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. It affects many people, particularly those in developing or underdeveloped nations with high pollution levels, unhygienic living conditions, overcrowding, and insufficient medical infrastructure. Pneumonia can cause pleural effusion, where fluids fill the lungs, leading to respiratory difficulty. Early diagnosis is crucial to ensure effective treatment and increase survival rates. Chest X-ray imaging is the most commonly used method for diagnosing pneumonia. However, visual examination of chest X-rays can be difficult and subjective. In this study, we have developed a computer-aided diagnosis system for automatic pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. We have used DenseNet-121 and ResNet50 as the backbone for the binary class (pneumonia and normal) and multi-class (bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal) classification tasks, respectively. We have also implemented a channel-specific spatial attention mechanism, called Fuzzy Channel Selective Spatial Attention Module (FCSSAM), to highlight the specific spatial regions of relevant channels while removing the irrelevant channels of the extracted features by the backbone. We evaluated the proposed approach on a publicly available chest X-ray dataset, using binary and multi-class classification setups. Our proposed method achieves accuracy rates of 97.15\% and 79.79\% for the binary and multi-class classification setups, respectively. The results of our proposed method are superior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The code of the proposed model will be available at: https://github.com/AyushRoy2001/FA-Net.</td>

However, existing Med-VQA methods based on joint embedding fail to explain whether their provided results are based on correct reasoning or coincidental answers, which undermines the credibility of VQA answers. In this paper, we investigate the construction of a more cohesive and stable Med-VQA structure. Motivated by causal effect, we propose a novel Triangular Reasoning VQA (Tri-VQA) framework, which constructs reverse causal questions from the perspective of "Why this answer?" to elucidate the source of the answer and stimulate more reasonable forward reasoning processes. We evaluate our method on the Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) multi-attribute annotated dataset from five centers, and test it on medical VQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Tri_VQA.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>3D-localization of gamma sources has the potential to improve the outcome of radio-guided surgery. The goal of this paper is to analyze the localization accuracy for point-like sources with a single coded aperture camera. We both simulated and measured a point-like $^{241}$Am source at $17$ positions distributed within the field of view of an experimental gamma camera. The setup includes a 0.11mm thick tungsten sheet with a MURA mask of rank $31$ and pinholes of $0.08$mm in diameter and a detector based on the photon counting readout circuit Timepix3. Two methods, namely an iterative search (ISL) including either a symmetric Gaussian fitting or an exponentially modified Gaussian fitting (EMG) and a center of mass method were compared to estimate the 3D source position. Considering the decreasing axial resolution with source-to-mask distance, the EMG improved the results by a factor of $4$ compared to the Gaussian fitting based on the simulated data. Overall, we obtained a mean localization error of $0.77$mm on the simulated and $2.64$mm on the experimental data in the imaging range of $20$mm to $100$ mm. This paper shows that despite the low axial resolution, point-like sources in the nearfield can be localized as well as with more sophisticated imaging devices such as stereo cameras. The influence of the source size and the photon count on the imaging and localization accuracy remains an important issue for further research.

The proposed framework employs internal and external retrieval mechanisms to extract relevant medical entities and relations from the report and external knowledge sources. A three-stage inference process is introduced, decomposing the task into error detection, localization, and correction subtasks, which enhances the explainability and performance of the system. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using a benchmark dataset created by corrupting real-world radiology reports with realistic errors, guided by domain experts. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methods, with the combination of internal and external retrieval significantly improving the accuracy of error detection, localization, and correction across various state-of-the-art LLMs. The findings contribute to the development of more robust and reliable error correction systems for clinical documentation.</td>
