<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI data, incorporating functional MRI data is challenging due to its complex structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address this, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder, a custom deep learning framework designed to improve brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. This model separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, isolating shared and modality-specific features. By integrating multitask learning with sex classification as an additional task, the model captures sex-specific aging patterns. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset, a large multisite brain MRI collection, the model achieves a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, outperforming traditional methods. This success positions M-AVAE as a powerful tool for metaverse-based healthcare applications in brain age estimation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuron importance assessment is crucial for understanding the inner workings of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and improving their interpretability and efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach to neuron significance assessment inspired by frequency tagging, a technique from neuroscience. By applying sinusoidal contrast modulation to image inputs and analyzing resulting neuron activations, this method enables fine-grained analysis of a network's decision-making processes. Experiments conducted with a convolutional neural network for image classification reveal notable harmonics and intermodulations in neuron-specific responses under part-based frequency tagging. These findings suggest that ANNs exhibit behavior akin to biological brains in tuning to flickering frequencies, thereby opening avenues for neuron/filter importance assessment through frequency tagging. The proposed method holds promise for applications in network pruning, and model interpretability, contributing to the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence and addressing the lack of transparency in neural networks. Future research directions include developing novel loss functions to encourage biologically plausible behavior in ANNs.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) has the ability to extract spatio-temporal features due to their spiking sequence. While previous research has primarily foucus on the classification of image and reinforcement learning. In our paper, we put forward novel diffusion policy model based on Spiking Transformer Neural Networks and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM): Spiking Transformer Modulate Diffusion Policy Model (STMDP), a new brain-inspired model for generating robot action trajectories. In order to improve the performance of this model, we develop a novel decoder module: Spiking Modulate De coder (SMD), which replaces the traditional Decoder module within the Transformer architecture. Additionally, we explored the substitution of DDPM with Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) in our frame work. We conducted experiments across four robotic manipulation tasks and performed ablation studies on the modulate block. Our model consistently outperforms existing Transformer-based diffusion policy method. Especially in Can task, we achieved an improvement of 8%. The proposed STMDP method integrates SNNs, dffusion model and Transformer architecture, which offers new perspectives and promising directions for exploration in brain-inspired robotics.</td>

Thirteen healthy participants and thirteen individuals from the gray zone were assessed using polysomnography and electroencephalogram to analyze both sleep architecture and neural activity. Although no significant differences in objective sleep quality or structure were found between the groups, gray zone individuals reported higher insomnia severity index scores, indicating subjective sleep difficulties. Electroencephalogram analysis revealed increased delta and alpha activity during the wake stage, suggesting lingering sleep inertia, while non-rapid eye movement stages 1 and 2 exhibited elevated beta and gamma activity, often associated with chronic insomnia. However, these high-frequency patterns were not observed in non-rapid eye movement stage 3 or rapid eye movement sleep, suggesting less severe disruptions compared to chronic insomnia. This study emphasizes that despite normal polysomnography findings, EEG patterns in gray zone individuals suggest a potential risk for chronic insomnia, highlighting the need for early identification and tailored intervention strategies to prevent progression.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by integrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Molecular communication (MC) in microfluidic channels faces significant challenges in signal detection due to the stochastic nature of molecule propagation and dynamic, noisy environments. Conventional detection methods often struggle under varying channel conditions, leading to high bit error rates (BER) and reduced communication efficiency. This paper introduces ART-Rx, a novel Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for MC that addresses these challenges. Implemented within a conceptual system-on-chip (SoC), ART-Rx employs a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust the detection threshold based on observed errors in real time. Comprehensive simulations using MATLAB and Smoldyn compare ART-Rx's performance against a statistically optimal detection threshold across various scenarios, including different levels of interference, concentration shift keying (CSK) levels, flow velocities, transmitter-receiver distances, diffusion coefficients, and binding rates. The results demonstrate that ART-Rx significantly outperforms conventional methods, maintaining consistently low BER and bit error probabilities (BEP) even in high-noise conditions and extreme channel environments. The system exhibits exceptional robustness to interference and shows the potential to enable higher data rates in CSK modulation. Furthermore, because ART-Rx is effectively adaptable to varying environmental conditions in microfluidic channels, it offers a computationally efficient and straightforward approach to enhance signal detection in nanoscale communication systems. This approach presents a promising control theory-based solution to improve the reliability of data transmission in practical MC systems, with potential applications in healthcare, brain-machine interfaces (BMI), and the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT).</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The human brain receives nutrients and oxygen through an intricate network of blood vessels. Pathology affecting small vessels, at the mesoscopic scale, represents a critical vulnerability within the cerebral blood supply and can lead to severe conditions, such as Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases. The advent of 7 Tesla MRI systems has enabled the acquisition of higher spatial resolution images, making it possible to visualise such vessels in the brain. However, the lack of publicly available annotated datasets has impeded the development of robust, machine learning-driven segmentation algorithms. To address this, the SMILE-UHURA challenge was organised. This challenge, held in conjunction with the ISBI 2023, in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, aimed to provide a platform for researchers working on related topics. The SMILE-UHURA challenge addresses the gap in publicly available annotated datasets by providing an annotated dataset of Time-of-Flight angiography acquired with 7T MRI. This dataset was created through a combination of automated pre-segmentation and extensive manual refinement. In this manuscript, sixteen submitted methods and two baseline methods are compared both quantitatively and qualitatively on two different datasets: held-out test MRAs from the same dataset as the training data (with labels kept secret) and a separate 7T ToF MRA dataset where both input volumes and labels are kept secret. The results demonstrate that most of the submitted deep learning methods, trained on the provided training dataset, achieved reliable segmentation performance. Dice scores reached up to 0.838 $\pm$ 0.066 and 0.716 $\pm$ 0.125 on the respective datasets, with an average performance of up to 0.804 $\pm$ 0.15.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>3D microscopic cerebrovascular images are characterized by their high resolution, presenting significant annotation challenges, large data volumes, and intricate variations in detail. Together, these factors make achieving high-quality, efficient whole-brain segmentation particularly demanding. In this paper, we propose a novel Vessel-Pattern-Based Semi-Supervised Distillation pipeline (VpbSD) to address the challenges of 3D microscopic cerebrovascular segmentation. This pipeline initially constructs a vessel-pattern codebook that captures diverse vascular structures from unlabeled data during the teacher model's pretraining phase. In the knowledge distillation stage, the codebook facilitates the transfer of rich knowledge from a heterogeneous teacher model to a student model, while the semi-supervised approach further enhances the student model's exposure to diverse learning samples. Experimental results on real-world data, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, demonstrate that our pipeline and its individual components effectively address the challenges inherent in microscopic cerebrovascular segmentation.</td>

This study investigates the classification performance and brain connectivity patterns associated with these paradigms, focusing on decoding accuracy across selected word classes. Sixteen participants engaged in tasks involving thirteen imagined speech and visual imagery classes, revealing above-chance classification accuracy for both paradigms. Variability in classification accuracy across individual classes highlights the influence of sensory and motor associations in imagined speech and vivid visual associations in visual imagery. Connectivity analysis further demonstrated increased functional connectivity in language-related and sensory regions for imagined speech, whereas visual imagery activated spatial and visual processing networks. These findings suggest the potential of imagined speech and visual imagery as an intuitive and scalable paradigm for BCI communication when selecting optimal word classes. Further exploration of the decoding outcomes for these two paradigms could provide insights for practical BCI communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar pre-existing SSL method and competitive against the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Attention is a vital cognitive process in the learning and memory environment, particularly in the context of online learning. Traditional methods for classifying attention states of online learners based on behavioral signals are prone to distortion, leading to increased interest in using electroencephalography (EEG) signals for authentic and accurate assessment. However, the field of attention state classification based on EEG signals in online learning faces challenges, including the scarcity of publicly available datasets, the lack of standardized data collection paradigms, and the requirement to consider the interplay between attention and other psychological states. In light of this, we present the Multi-label EEG dataset for classifying Mental Attention states (MEMA) in online learning. We meticulously designed a reliable and standard experimental paradigm with three attention states: neutral, relaxing, and concentrating, considering human physiological and psychological characteristics. This paradigm collected EEG signals from 20 subjects, each participating in 12 trials, resulting in 1,060 minutes of data. Emotional state labels, basic personal information, and personality traits were also collected to investigate the relationship between attention and other psychological states. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, including a multi-label correlation study, validated the quality of the EEG attention data. The MEMA dataset and analysis provide valuable insights for advancing research on attention in online learning. The dataset is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/GuanjianLiu/MEMA}.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. However, small hospitals and clinics often lack advanced EEG signal analysis systems and are prone to misinterpretation in manual EEG reading. This study proposes an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system for automatic interpretation of EEG background activity and report generation. The system combines deep learning models for posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) prediction, unsupervised artifact removal, and expert-designed algorithms for abnormality detection. For PDR prediction, 1530 labeled EEGs were used, and the best ensemble model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.237, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.359, an accuracy of 91.8% within a 0.6Hz error, and an accuracy of 99% within a 1.2Hz error. The AI system significantly outperformed neurologists in detecting generalized background slowing (p = 0.02; F1: AI 0.93, neurologists 0.82) and demonstrated improved focal abnormality detection, although not statistically significant (p = 0.79; F1: AI 0.71, neurologists 0.55). Validation on both an internal dataset and the Temple University Abnormal EEG Corpus showed consistent performance (F1: 0.884 and 0.835, respectively; p = 0.66), demonstrating generalizability. The use of large language models (LLMs) for report generation demonstrated 100% accuracy, verified by three other independent LLMs. This hybrid AI system provides an easily scalable and accurate solution for EEG interpretation in resource-limited settings, assisting neurologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing misdiagnosis rates.</td>

Brain-computer interface technology leverages this brain activity to generate external commands for controlling the environment, offering critical advantages to individuals with paralysis or locked-in syndrome. Within the brain-computer interface domain, brain-to-speech research has gained attention, focusing on the direct synthesis of audible speech from brain signals. Most current studies decode speech from brain activity using invasive techniques and emphasize spoken speech data. However, humans express various speech states, and distinguishing these states through non-invasive approaches remains a significant yet challenging task. This research investigated the effectiveness of deep learning models for non-invasive-based neural signal decoding, with an emphasis on distinguishing between different speech paradigms, including perceived, overt, whispered, and imagined speech, across multiple frequency bands. The model utilizing the spatial conventional neural network module demonstrated superior performance compared to other models, especially in the gamma band. Additionally, imagined speech in the theta frequency band, where deep learning also showed strong effects, exhibited statistically significant differences compared to the other speech paradigms.</td>

These developments are fundamental in exploring how neural signals can be interpreted to recognize specific physical actions. This study centers on a written alphabet classification task, where we aim to decode EEG signals associated with handwriting. To achieve this, we incorporate hand kinematics to guide the extraction of the consistent embeddings from high-dimensional neural recordings using auxiliary variables (CEBRA). These CEBRA embeddings, along with the EEG, are processed by a parallel convolutional neural network model that extracts features from both data sources simultaneously. The model classifies nine different handwritten characters, including symbols such as exclamation marks and commas, within the alphabet. We evaluate the model using a quantitative five-fold cross-validation approach and explore the structure of the embedding space through visualizations. Our approach achieves a classification accuracy of 91 % for the nine-class task, demonstrating the feasibility of fine-grained handwriting decoding from EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Background and Objective: Depression is a severe mental disorder, and accurate diagnosis is pivotal to the cure and rehabilitation of people with depression. However, the current questionnaire-based diagnostic methods could bring subjective biases and may be denied by subjects. In search of a more objective means of diagnosis, researchers have begun to experiment with deep learning-based methods for identifying depressive disorders in recent years. Methods: In this study, a novel Spatiotemporal-fused network with Automated multi-scale Depth-wise and TIME-interval-related common feature extractor (SAD-TIME) is proposed. SAD-TIME incorporates an automated nodes' common features extractor (CFE), a spatial sector (SpS), a modified temporal sector (TeS), and a domain adversarial learner (DAL). The CFE includes a multi-scale depth-wise 1D-convolutional neural network and a time-interval embedding generator, where the unique information of each channel is preserved. The SpS fuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity containing spatial position of EEG electrodes. A multi-head-attention graph convolutional network is also applied in the SpS to fuse the features from different EEG channels. The TeS is based on long short-term memory and graph transformer networks, where the temporal information of different time-windows is fused. Moreover, the DAL is used after the SpS to obtain the domain-invariant feature. Results: Experimental results under tenfold cross-validation show that the proposed SAD-TIME method achieves 92.00% and 94.00% depression classification accuracies on two datasets, respectively, in cross-subject mode. Conclusion: SAD-TIME is a robust depression detection model, where the automatedly-generated features, the SpS and the TeS assist the classification performance with the fusion of the innate spatiotemporal information in the EEG signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding the directional focus of an attended speaker from listeners' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for developing brain-computer interfaces to improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment. Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus decoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or right side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, we observe that, on our recently presented dataset with 15-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibits significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved. We employ the CNN, LSM-CNN, and EEG-Deformer models to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals with the auxiliary audio spatial spectra. The proposed Sp-Aux-Deformer model achieves notable 15-class decoding accuracies of 57.48% and 61.83% in leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have emphasized the promise of imagined speech and visual imagery as effective paradigms for intuitive communication. This study investigates the classification performance and brain connectivity patterns associated with these paradigms, focusing on decoding accuracy across selected word classes. Sixteen participants engaged in tasks involving thirteen imagined speech and visual imagery classes, revealing above-chance classification accuracy for both paradigms. Variability in classification accuracy across individual classes highlights the influence of sensory and motor associations in imagined speech and vivid visual associations in visual imagery. Connectivity analysis further demonstrated increased functional connectivity in language-related and sensory regions for imagined speech, whereas visual imagery activated spatial and visual processing networks. These findings suggest the potential of imagined speech and visual imagery as an intuitive and scalable paradigm for BCI communication when selecting optimal word classes. Further exploration of the decoding outcomes for these two paradigms could provide insights for practical BCI communication.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning has achieved great success in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Most existing BCI studies focused on improving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial security. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in other application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed that their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on benign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of data alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers simultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets from two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event related potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers (EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings (offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online cross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its effectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are usually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously improve the model accuracy and robustness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The integration of the Metaverse into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the need for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) that are driven by the multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct interaction between humans and computers by analyzing brain signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the non-invasive tools used in BCI systems, providing high temporal resolution for real-time applications. However, EEG signals are often affected by a low signal-to-noise ratio, physiological artifacts, and individual variability, representing challenges in extracting distinct features. Also, motor imagery (MI)-based EEG signals could contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics, which might cause the weights of the deep model to become biased towards those features. To address these problems, we proposed the end-to-end deep preprocessing method that effectively enhances MI characteristics while attenuating features with low correlation to MI characteristics. The proposed method consisted of the temporal, spatial, graph, and similarity blocks to preprocess MI-based EEG signals, aiming to extract more discriminative features and improve the robustness. We evaluated the proposed method using the public dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV to compare the performances when integrating the proposed method into the conventional models, including the DeepConvNet, the M-ShallowConvNet, and the EEGNet. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve the improved performances and lead to more clustered feature distributions of MI tasks. Hence, we demonstrated that our proposed method could enhance discriminative features related to MI characteristics.</td>

This study explores the neural signatures of motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) tasks using EEG signals, focusing on four conditions categorized as sense-related (hot and cold) and motor-related (pull and push) conditions. We conducted scalp topography analysis to examine activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, revealing distinct regional differences: sense--related conditions primarily activated the posterior region of the sensorimotor cortex, while motor--related conditions activated the anterior region of the sensorimotor cortex. These spatial distinctions align with neurophysiological principles, suggesting condition-specific functional subdivisions within the sensorimotor cortex. We further evaluated the performances of three neural network models-EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet-demonstrating that ME tasks achieved higher classification accuracies compared to MI tasks. Specifically, in sense-related conditions, the highest accuracy was observed in the cold condition. In motor-related conditions, the pull condition showed the highest performance, with DeepConvNet yielding the highest results. These findings provide insights into optimizing BCI applications by leveraging specific condition-induced neural activations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Resting-state EEG data in neuroscience research serve as reliable markers for user identification and reveal individual-specific traits. Despite this, the use of resting-state data in EEG classification models is limited. In this work, we propose a feature concatenation approach to enhance decoding models' generalization by integrating resting-state EEG, aiming to improve motor imagery BCI performance and develop a user-generalized model. Using feature concatenation, we combine the EEGNet model, a standard convolutional neural network for EEG signal classification, with functional connectivity measures derived from resting-state EEG data. The findings suggest that although grounded in neuroscience with data-driven learning, the concatenation approach has limited benefits for generalizing models in within-user and across-user scenarios. While an improvement in mean accuracy for within-user scenarios is observed on two datasets, concatenation doesn't benefit across-user scenarios when compared with random data concatenation. The findings indicate the necessity of further investigation on the model interpretability and the effect of random data concatenation on model robustness.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The rapid evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) has significantly influenced the domain of human-computer interaction, with Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) emerging as a notably robust paradigm. This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Emotion is often described as something people 'feel' in their bodies. Embodied emotion theorists propose that this connection is not purely linguistic; perceiving an emotion may require somatosensory and motor re-experiencing. However, it remains unclear whether self-reports of emotion-related bodily sensations (i.e., 'lump in my throat') are related to neural simulations of bodily action and sensation or whether they can be explained by cognitive appraisals or the visual features of socioemotional signals. To investigate this, participants (N = 21) were shown arousing emotional images that varied in valence, complexity, and content while undergoing fMRI scans. Participants then rated the images on a set of emotion appraisal scales and indicated where, on a body map, they experienced sensation in response to the image. To derive normative models of responses on these scales, a separate larger online sample online (N = 56 - 128) also rated these images. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to compare the emotional content in the body maps with appraisals and visual features. A pairwise distance matrix between the body maps generated for each stimulus was then used in a whole brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis to identify brain regions which reflect the representational geometry of embodied emotion. This analysis revealed a network including bilateral primary somatosensory and motor cortices, precuneus, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between emotion and the body is not purely conceptual: It is supported by sensorimotor cortical activations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain connectivity alternations associated with brain disorders have been widely reported in resting-state functional imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous fusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural connectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better leverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood oxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by rs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships within the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish hetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community searching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further introduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances homo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information and preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the flexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data augmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue commonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective and superior to other algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.3%.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Time series generation has emerged as an essential tool for analyzing temporal data across numerous fields. While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets. We have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting and MuJoCo imputation tasks, significantly enhanced by our innovative $t$ power sampling method.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neural decoding, the process of understanding how brain activity corresponds to different stimuli, has been a primary objective in cognitive sciences. Over the past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across the whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that "seeing" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding stimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing. Additionally, we implemented zero-shot imagination decoding on an extra validation dataset, achieving a p-value of 0.0206 for mapping the reconstructed images and ground-truth text stimuli, which substantiates the model's capability to capture semantic meanings across various scenarios.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial strategy for white matter (WM) parcellation. Current methods primarily use the geometric information of fibers (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, overlooking the important functional signals present along the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), offering potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), that uses joint dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. It includes two major components: 1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from fiber geometric information and functional signals separately, and 2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the two kinds of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We investigate whether and how we can improve the cost efficiency of neuroimaging studies with well-tailored fMRI tasks. The comparative study is conducted using a novel network science-driven Bayesian connectome-based predictive method, which incorporates network theories in model building and substantially improves precision and robustness in imaging biomarker detection. The robustness of the method lays the foundation for identifying predictive power differential across fMRI task conditions if such difference exists. When applied to a clinically heterogeneous transdiagnostic cohort, we found shared and distinct functional fingerprints of neuropsychological outcomes across seven fMRI conditions. For example, emotional N-back memory task was found to be less optimal for negative emotion outcomes, and gradual-onset continuous performance task was found to have stronger links with sensitivity and sociability outcomes than with cognitive control outcomes. Together, our results show that there are unique optimal pairings of task-based fMRI conditions and neuropsychological outcomes that should not be ignored when designing well-powered neuroimaging studies.</td>

These interactions often reveal intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science. Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role in information integration within the human brain.</td>

The MEG II apparatus at PSI, designed to search for the $\mu^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ decay, can be exploited to investigate the existence of this particle and study its nature. Protons from a Cockroft-Walton accelerator, with an energy up to 1.1 MeV, were delivered on a dedicated Li-based target.

No significant signal was found, and limits at \SI{90}{\percent} C.L. on the branching ratios (relative to the $\gamma$ emission) of the two resonances to X17 were set, $R_{17.6} < 1.8 \times 10^{-6} $ and $R_{18.1} < 1.2 \times 10^{-5} $.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</td>

Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Machine learning techniques have enabled researchers to leverage neuroimaging data to decode speech from brain activity, with some amazing recent successes achieved by applications built using invasive devices. However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Federated Learning (FL) is a pioneering approach in distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients while retaining data privacy. However, the inherent heterogeneity due to imbalanced resource representations across multiple clients poses significant challenges, often introducing bias towards the majority class. This issue is particularly prevalent in healthcare settings, where hospitals acting as clients share medical images. To address class imbalance and reduce bias, we propose a co-distillation driven framework in a federated healthcare setting. Unlike traditional federated setups with a designated server client, our framework promotes knowledge sharing among clients to collectively improve learning outcomes. Our experiments demonstrate that in a federated healthcare setting, co-distillation outperforms other federated methods in handling class imbalance. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework has the least standard deviation with increasing imbalance while outperforming other baselines, signifying the robustness of our framework for FL in healthcare.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electronic health records (EHRs) contain important longitudinal information on individuals who have received medical care. Traditionally, EHRs have been used to support a wide range of administrative activities such as billing and clinical workflow, but, given the depth and breadth of clinical and demographic data they contain, they are increasingly being used to provide real-world data for research. Although EHR data have enormous research potential, the full realization of that potential requires a data management strategy that extracts from large EHR databases, that are collected from a range of care settings and time periods, well-documented research-relevant data that can be used by different researchers. Having a common well-documented data management strategy for EHR will support reproducible research and sharing documentation on research variables that are derived from EHR variables is important to open science. In this short paper, we describe the EHRs Data Harmonization Platform. The platform is based on an easy to use web app a publicly available at https://poxotn-arian-aminoleslami.shinyapps.io/Arian/ and as a standalone software package at https://github.com/ArianAminoleslami/EHRs-Data Harmonization-Platform, that is linked to an existing R library for data harmonization called recodeflow. The platform can be used to extract, document, and harmonize variables from EHR and it can also be used to document and share research variables that have been derived from those EHR data.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Model interpretability is a key challenge that has yet to align with the advancements observed in contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, deep learning aided vision tasks require interpretability, in order for their adoption in more specialized domains such as medical imaging. Although the field of explainable AI (XAI) developed methods for interpreting vision models along with early convolutional neural networks, recent XAI research has mainly focused on assigning attributes via saliency maps. As such, these methods are restricted to providing explanations at a sample level, and many explainability methods suffer from low adaptability across a wide range of vision models. In our work, we re-think vision-model explainability from a novel perspective, to probe the general input structure that a model has learnt during its training. To this end, we ask the question: "How would a vision model fill-in a masked-image". Experiments on standard vision datasets and pre-trained models reveal consistent patterns, and could be intergrated as an additional model-agnostic explainability tool in modern machine-learning platforms.

However, achieving such precision often requires a large amount of finely annotated data, which can be costly. Scribble annotation presents a more efficient alternative, boosting labeling efficiency.

To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a novel framework that leverages scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Given sufficient data from multiple edge devices, federated learning (FL) enables training a shared model without transmitting private data to a central server. However, FL is generally vulnerable to Byzantine attacks from compromised edge devices, which can significantly degrade the model performance. In this paper, we propose a intuitive plugin that can be integrated into existing FL techniques to achieve Byzantine-Resilience. Key idea is to generate virtual data samples and evaluate model consistency scores across local updates to effectively filter out compromised edge devices. By utilizing this scoring mechanism before the aggregation phase, the proposed plugin enables existing FL techniques to become robust against Byzantine attacks while maintaining their original benefits. Numerical results on medical image classification task validate that plugging the proposed approach into representative FL algorithms, effectively achieves Byzantine resilience. Furthermore, the proposed plugin maintains the original convergence properties of the base FL algorithms when no Byzantine attacks are present.</td>

In pairwise comparisons conducted by 215 human raters, we found that detailed constitutions led to better results regarding emotive qualities. However, none of the constitutions outperformed the baseline in learning more practically-oriented skills related to information gathering and provision.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Medical images often exhibit distribution shifts due to variations in imaging protocols and scanners across different medical centers. Domain Generalization (DG) methods aim to train models on source domains that can generalize to unseen target domains. Recently, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalization capabilities due to its prompt-based design, and has gained significant attention in image segmentation tasks. Existing SAM-based approaches attempt to address the need for manual prompts by introducing prompt generators that automatically generate these prompts. However, we argue that auto-generated prompts may not be sufficiently accurate under distribution shifts, potentially leading to incorrect predictions that still require manual verification and correction by clinicians. To address this challenge, we propose a method for 2D medical image segmentation called Self-Correcting SAM (CoSAM). Our approach begins by generating coarse masks using SAM in a prompt-free manner, providing prior prompts for the subsequent stages, and eliminating the need for prompt generators. To automatically refine these coarse masks, we introduce a generalized error decoder that simulates the correction process typically performed by clinicians. Furthermore, we generate diverse prompts as feedback based on the corrected masks, which are used to iteratively refine the predictions within a self-correcting loop, enhancing the generalization performance of our model. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation benchmarks across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority of CoSAM over state-of-the-art SAM-based methods.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Longitudinal analyses are increasingly used in clinical studies as they allow the study of subtle changes over time within the same subjects. In most of these studies, it is necessary to align all the images studied to a common reference by registering them to a template. In the study of white matter using the recently developed fixel-based analysis (FBA) method, this registration is important, in particular because the fiber bundle cross-section metric is a direct measure of this registration. In the vast majority of longitudinal FBA studies described in the literature, sessions acquired for a same subject are directly independently registered to the template. However, it has been shown in T1-based morphometry that a 2-step registration through an intra-subject average can be advantageous in longitudinal analyses. In this work, we propose an implementation of this 2-step registration method in a typical longitudinal FBA aimed at investigating the evolution of white matter changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared at the fixel level the mean absolute effect and standard deviation yielded by this registration method and by a direct registration, as well as the results obtained with each registration method for the study of AD in both fixelwise and tract-based analyses. We found that the 2-step method reduced the variability of the measurements and thus enhanced statistical power in both types of analyses.</td>
