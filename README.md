<td style='padding: 4px;'>Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In proton therapy of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, contrast-enhancing brain lesions (CEBLs) on magnetic resonance imaging are considered predictive of late radiation-induced lesions. From the observation that CEBLs tend to concentrate in regions of increased dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET) and proximal to the ventricular system, the probability of lesion origin (POLO) model has been established as a multivariate logistic regression model for the voxel-wise probability prediction of the CEBL origin. To date, leveraging the predictive power of the POLO model for treatment planning relies on hand tuning the dose and LET distribution to minimize the resulting probability predictions. In this paper, we therefore propose automated POLO model-based treatment planning by directly integrating POLO calculation and optimization into plan optimization for LGG patients. We introduce an extension of the original POLO model including a volumetric correction factor, and a model-based optimization scheme featuring a linear reformulation of the model together with feasible optimization functions based on the predicted POLO values. The developed framework is implemented in the open-source treatment planning toolkit matRad. Our framework can generate clinically acceptable treatment plans while automatically taking into account outcome predictions from the POLO model. It also supports the definition of customized POLO model-based objective and constraint functions. Optimization results from a sample LGG patient show that the POLO model-based outcome predictions can be minimized under expected shifts in dose, LET, and POLO distributions, while sustaining target coverage ($\Delta_{\text{PTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.03}$, $\Delta_{\text{GTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.001}$), even at large NTCP reductions of $\Delta{\text{NTCP}}\approx{26}\%$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>It takes several years for the developing brain of a baby to fully master word repetition-the task of hearing a word and repeating it aloud. Repeating a new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition. While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable, allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech errors in the "patient" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects, highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at developing human-like neural models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Tracing physiological neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA) with detection limits down to $\mathrm{1\times10^{-8}}$ mM is a critical goal in neuroscience for studying brain functions and progressing the understanding of cerebral disease. Addressing this problem requires enhancing the current state-of-the-art additive-free electrochemical workstation methods by over two orders of magnitude. In this work, we implement an ultra-sensitive, additive-free platform exploiting suitably engineered light-scattering membranes and optical accelerators integrated into commercial vision cameras, reporting real-time detection of DA in uric and ascorbic acid below the concentration of $\mathrm{10^{-8}}$ mM. These performances improve the current best technology by over two orders of magnitude in resolution while providing continuous, real-time detection at video rates. This technology also upgrades the bulk form factor of an electrochemical workstation with an imaging camera's compact and portable footprint. The optical accelerator implemented in this work is universal and trainable to detect a wide range of biological analytes. This technology's wide adoption could help enable early disease detection and personalized treatment adjustments while improving the management of neurological, mental, and immune-related conditions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The high computational complexity and increasing parameter counts of deep neural networks pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or real-time systems. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient neural architecture where neurons are embedded in Euclidean space. During training, their positions are optimized and synaptic weights are determined as the inverse of the spatial distance between connected neurons. These distance-dependent wiring rules replace traditional learnable weight matrices and significantly reduce the number of parameters while introducing a biologically inspired inductive bias: connection strength decreases with spatial distance, reflecting the brain's embedding in three-dimensional space where connections tend to minimize wiring length. We validate this approach for both multi-layer perceptrons and spiking neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that these spatially embedded neural networks achieve a performance competitive with conventional architectures on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the models maintain performance even at pruning rates exceeding 80% sparsity, outperforming traditional networks with the same number of parameters under similar conditions. Finally, the spatial embedding framework offers an intuitive visualization of the network structure.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) present a promising solution to restoring and decoding brain activity lost due to injury. However, patients with such neuroprosthetics suffer from permanent skull openings resulting from the devices' bulky wiring. This drives the development of wireless iBMIs, which demand low power consumption and small device footprint. Most recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been researched as potential candidates for low-power neural decoding. In this work, we present the next step of utilizing SNNs for such tasks, building on the recently published results of the 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding Challenge for Motor Control of non-Human Primates. We optimize our model architecture to exceed the existing state of the art on the Primate Reaching dataset while maintaining similar resource demand through various compression techniques. We further focus on implementing a realtime-capable version of the model and discuss the implications of this architecture. With this, we advance one step towards latency-free decoding of cortical spike trains using neuromorphic technology, ultimately improving the lives of millions of paralyzed patients.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval. Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.</td>

Although numerous surveys have reviewed the application of FM in healthcare care, brain imaging remains underrepresented, despite its critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases using modalities such as MRI, CT, and PET. Existing reviews either marginalize brain imaging or lack depth on the unique challenges and requirements of FM in this domain, such as multimodal data integration, support for diverse clinical tasks, and handling of heterogeneous, fragmented datasets.   To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive and curated review of FMs for brain imaging. We systematically analyze 161 brain imaging datasets and 86 FM architectures, providing information on key design choices, training paradigms, and optimizations driving recent advances. Our review highlights the leading models for various brain imaging tasks, summarizes their innovations, and critically examines current limitations and blind spots in the literature. We conclude by outlining future research directions to advance FM applications in brain imaging, with the aim of fostering progress in both clinical and research settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides a valuable tool for quantifying susceptibility distributions in human brains; however, two types of opposing susceptibility sources (i.e., paramagnetic and diamagnetic), may coexist in a single voxel, and cancel each other out in net QSM images. Susceptibility source separation techniques enable the extraction of sub-voxel information from QSM maps. This study proposes a novel SUSEP-Net for susceptibility source separation by training a dual-branch U-net with a simulation-supervised training strategy. In addition, a contrastive learning framework is included to explicitly impose similarity-based constraints between the branch-specific guidance features in specially-designed encoders and the latent features in the decoders. Comprehensive experiments were carried out on both simulated and in vivo data, including healthy subjects and patients with pathological conditions, to compare SUSEP-Net with three state-of-the-art susceptibility source separation methods (i.e., APART-QSM, \c{hi}-separation, and \c{hi}-sepnet). SUSEP-Net consistently showed improved results compared with the other three methods, with better numerical metrics, improved high-intensity hemorrhage and calcification lesion contrasts, and reduced artifacts in brains with pathological conditions. In addition, experiments on an agarose gel phantom data were conducted to validate the accuracy and the generalization capability of SUSEP-Net.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Additive smooth models, such as Generalized additive models (GAMs) of location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), are a popular choice for modeling experimental data. However, software available to fit such models is usually not tailored specifically to the estimation of mixed models. As a result, estimation can slow down as the number of random effects increases. Additionally, users often have to provide a substantial amount of problem-specific information in case they are interested in more general non-standard smooth models, such as higher-order derivatives of the likelihood. Here we combined and extended recently proposed strategies to reduce memory requirements and matrix infill into a theoretical framework that supports efficient estimation of general mixed sparse smooth models, including GAMs & GAMLSS, based only on the Gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood. To make non-standard smooth models more accessible, we developed an approximate estimation algorithm (the L-qEFS update) based on limited-memory quasi-Newton methods. This enables estimation of any general smooth model based only on the log-likelihood function. We also considered the problem of model selection for general mixed smooth models. To facilitate practical application we provide a Python implementation of the theoretical framework, algorithms, and model selection strategies presented here: the Mixed-Sparse-Smooth-Model (MSSM) toolbox. MSSM supports estimation and selection of massive additive multi-level models that are impossible to estimate with alternative software, for example of trial level EEG data. Additionally, when the L-qEFS update is used for estimation, implementing a new non-standard smooth model in MSSM is straightforward. Results from multiple simulation studies and real data examples are presented, showing that the framework implemented in MSSM is both efficient and robust to numerical instabilities.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite rapid advances in autonomous driving, current autonomous vehicles (AVs) lack effective bidirectional communication with occupants, limiting personalization and recovery from immobilization. This reduces comfort and trust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy framework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external traffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation model-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a Psychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG, heart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a Coordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior decisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV modules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level, delegating low-level control to native AV systems. This separation enables closed-loop adaptation and supports integration across diverse platforms. We evaluate PACE-ADS in simulation across varied scenarios involving traffic lights, pedestrians, work zones, and car following. Results show that PACE-ADS adapts driving styles to occupant states, improves ride comfort, and enables safe recovery from immobilization via autonomous reasoning or human guidance. Our findings highlight the promise of LLM-based frameworks for bridging the gap between machine autonomy and human-centered driving.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neurovascular coupling (NVC) refers to the process by which local neural activity, through energy consumption, induces changes in regional cerebral blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of neurons. Event-related studies have shown that the hemodynamic response typically lags behind neural activation by 4-6 seconds. However, little is known about how NVC is altered in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and throughout the recovery process. In this study, we employed simultaneous resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor neural and hemodynamic signals. Twelve patients with MDD during the acute phase, ten patients in the maintenance or consolidation phase, and six healthy controls were involved. We calculated the differences in coherence and temporal delay between spontaneous peak electrophysiological activity and hemodynamic responses across groups during the resting state in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that the neural activity and its subsequent correlation with hemodynamic responses were significantly higher in patients during the maintenance phase. The rise time from the lowest to the highest point of correlation was shorter in healthy individuals than in patients in the acute phase, and gradually recovered during remission. By leveraging wearable neuroimaging techniques, this study reveals alterations in neurovascular coupling in depression and offers novel multimodal insights into potential biomarkers for MDD and its recovery process.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns, and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized healthcare systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus, compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR) and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition quality.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare, criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs. Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841 macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS, establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning.</td>

This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-computer interfaces offer significant therapeutic opportunities for a variety of neurophysiological and neuropsychiatric disorders and may perhaps one day lead to augmenting the cognition and decision-making of the healthy brain. However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The isomorphism problem for digraphs is a fundamental problem in graph theory. In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley digraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive integer. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly on the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$. In our previous paper, we developed a theory for $m$-Cayley isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and classified finite $m$CI-groups for each $m\geq 2$, and finite $m$PCI-groups for each $m\geq 4$. The next natural step is to classify finite $m$PCI-groups for $m=2$ or $3$. Note that BCI-groups form an important subclass of the $2$PCI-groups, which were introduced in 2008 by Xu et al. Despite much effort having been made on the study of BCI-groups, the problem of classifying finite BCI-groups is still widely open.   In this paper, we prove that every finite $2$PCI-group is solvable, and its Sylow $3$-subgroup is isomorphic to $Z_3, Z_3\times Z_3$ or $Z_9$, and Sylow $p$-subgroup with $p\not=3$ is either elementary abelian, or isomorphic to $Z_4$ or $Q_8$. We also introduce the kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and establish some useful theory for studying this kind of isomorphisms. Using the results of kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs together with the results on $2$PCI-groups, we give a proper description of finite BCI-groups, and in particular, we obtain a complete classification of finite non-abelian BCI-groups.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient, and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent improvements in data quality and classification performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can achieve high recognition accuracy with sufficient training data. Transfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements for the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however, effectively addressing individual variability among both target and source subjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which leverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual contributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general feature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a common latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the unique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we further design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA), which integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify appropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components (TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA frameworks. This study provides a potential solution for developing high-performance SSVEP-based BCIs with reduced target subject data.</td>

The problem has been previously explored with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR, that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user study, N=53).</td>

We introduce a large dataset capturing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, eye-tracking, high-speed camera recordings, as well as subjects' mental states and characteristics, to provide a multifactor analysis of eye-related movements. Four paradigms -- motor imagery, motor execution, steady-state visually evoked potentials, and P300 spellers -- are selected due to their capacity to evoke various sensory-motor responses and potential influence on ocular activity. This online-available dataset contains over 46 hours of data from 31 subjects across 63 sessions, totaling 2520 trials for each of the first three paradigms, and 5670 for P300. This multimodal and multi-paradigms dataset is expected to allow the development of algorithms capable of efficiently handling eye-induced artifacts and enhancing task-specific classification. Furthermore, it offers the opportunity to evaluate the cross-paradigm robustness involving the same participants.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) hold promise for restoring control in individuals with motor impairments. However, up to 30% of users remain unable to effectively use BCIs-a phenomenon termed ''BCI inefficiency.'' This study addresses a major limitation in current BCI training protocols: the use of fixed-length training paradigms that ignore individual learning variability. We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal avalanches-spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity-as biomarkers to characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche length and activations. These features revealed significant training and taskcondition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in these features across sessions ($\Delta$avalanche length and $\Delta$activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest. These findings demonstrate the utility of neuronal avalanche dynamics as robust biomarkers for BCI training, supporting the development of personalized protocols aimed at mitigating BCI illiteracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite variations in architecture and pretraining strategies, recent studies indicate that large-scale AI models often converge toward similar internal representations that also align with neural activity. We propose that scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales. We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations, providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like AI systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models' perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains, suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be generalized to neural measures.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on 28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S., South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based clinical research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test). Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related cognitive decline and NCD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence. Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is available at https://github.com/marcusstang/InfoDPCCA.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.</td>

Recent models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction. Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction. We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.</td>

Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm.

Among its most promising applications is the restoration of communication to paralysed individuals affected by speech deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the conditions for an "ImageNet moment" or breakthrough in non-invasive neural decoding, by harnessing the collective power of the machine learning community.   To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset recorded to date (LibriBrain) together with a user-friendly Python library (pnpl) for easy data access and integration with deep learning frameworks. For the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Edge-Geodetic Sets play a crucial role in network monitoring and optimization, wherein the goal is to strategically place monitoring stations on vertices of a network, represented as a graph, to ensure complete coverage of edges and mitigate faults by monitoring lines of communication. This paper illustrates and explores the Monitoring Edge-Geodetic Set (MEG-set) problem, which involves determining the minimum set of vertices that need to be monitored to achieve geodetic coverage for a given network. The significance of this problem lies in its potential to facilitate efficient network monitoring, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of various applications. In this work, we prove the $\mathcal{NP}$-completeness of the MEG-set optimization problem by showing a reduction from the well-known Vertex Cover problem. Furthermore, we present inapproximability results, proving that the MEG-set optimization problem is $\mathcal{APX}$-Hard and that, if the unique games conjecture holds, the problem is not approximable within a factor of $2-\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. Despite its $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm achieving an approximation ratio of $O(\sqrt{|V(G)| \cdot \ln{|V(G)|})}$ for the MEG-set optimization problem, based on the well-known Set Cover approximation algorithm, where $|V(G)|$ is the number of nodes of the MEG-set instance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now capable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical conditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience negative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the model can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's negative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a more reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address this issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and emotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset, generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their concerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models with various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences with both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to patients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental results demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's ability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original capability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.</td>

These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature, and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The identification of biomarkers with high predictive accuracy is a crucial task in medical research, as it can aid clinicians in making early decisions, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are the main tool used to assess the accuracy of prognostic biomarkers for outcomes that evolve over time. Recognising the need to account for patient heterogeneity when evaluating the accuracy of a prognostic biomarker, we introduce a novel penalised-based estimator of the time-dependent ROC curve that accommodates a possible modifying effect of covariates. We consider flexible models for both the hazard function of the event time given the covariates and biomarker and for the location-scale regression model of the biomarker given covariates, enabling the accommodation of non-proportional hazards and nonlinear effects through penalised splines, thus overcoming limitations of earlier methods. The simulation study demonstrates that our approach successfully recovers the true functional form of the covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curve and the corresponding area under the curve across a variety of scenarios. Comparisons with existing methods further show that our approach performs favourably in multiple settings. Our approach is applied to evaluating the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score's ability to predict mortality after discharge in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome and how this ability may vary with the left ventricular ejection fraction. An R package, CondTimeROC, implementing the proposed method is provided.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management. However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume. This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90 degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction. Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78 planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of 29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity. LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate, personalized treatments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In proton therapy of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, contrast-enhancing brain lesions (CEBLs) on magnetic resonance imaging are considered predictive of late radiation-induced lesions. From the observation that CEBLs tend to concentrate in regions of increased dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET) and proximal to the ventricular system, the probability of lesion origin (POLO) model has been established as a multivariate logistic regression model for the voxel-wise probability prediction of the CEBL origin. To date, leveraging the predictive power of the POLO model for treatment planning relies on hand tuning the dose and LET distribution to minimize the resulting probability predictions. In this paper, we therefore propose automated POLO model-based treatment planning by directly integrating POLO calculation and optimization into plan optimization for LGG patients. We introduce an extension of the original POLO model including a volumetric correction factor, and a model-based optimization scheme featuring a linear reformulation of the model together with feasible optimization functions based on the predicted POLO values. The developed framework is implemented in the open-source treatment planning toolkit matRad. Our framework can generate clinically acceptable treatment plans while automatically taking into account outcome predictions from the POLO model. It also supports the definition of customized POLO model-based objective and constraint functions. Optimization results from a sample LGG patient show that the POLO model-based outcome predictions can be minimized under expected shifts in dose, LET, and POLO distributions, while sustaining target coverage ($\Delta_{\text{PTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.03}$, $\Delta_{\text{GTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.001}$), even at large NTCP reductions of $\Delta{\text{NTCP}}\approx{26}\%$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Performance evaluation for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains a crucial but unsolved problem today especially in the medical domain. Various evaluation metrics have been discussed in the literature to solve this problem. Most of the existing metrics (e.g., precision, recall) are adapted from classification tasks which require manual labels as ground truth. However, such labels are often expensive and unavailable in specific thematic domains. Furthermore, medical images are usually associated with (radiological) case reports or annotated with descriptive captions in literature figures, such text contains information that can help to assess CBIR.Several researchers have argued that the medical concepts hidden in the text can serve as the basis for CBIR evaluation purpose. However, these works often consider these medical concepts as independent and isolated labels while in fact the subtle relationships between various concepts are neglected. In this work, we introduce the use of knowledge graphs to measure the distance between various medical concepts and propose a novel relevance measure for the evaluation of CBIR by defining an approximate matching-based relevance score between two sets of medical concepts which allows us to indirectly measure the similarity between medical images.We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our relevance measure using a public dataset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Overlapping object perception aims to decouple the randomly overlapping foreground-background features, extracting foreground features while suppressing background features, which holds significant application value in fields such as security screening and medical auxiliary diagnosis. Despite some research efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most solutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain analysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the overlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum. Based on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized Anti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more texture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for anti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency Spatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features from both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more texture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the Hierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in the separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially designed consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses the response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the perception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically for the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection, Prohibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection. The code will be open source once the paper is accepted.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Purpose: 44Sc has been successfully produced, synthesized, labeled and first-in-human studies were conducted some years ago. The decay properties of 44Sc, together with being close to a clinical implementation, make it an ideal candidate for in vivo positronium lifetime measurements. In this study, we investigate the count statistics for ortho-positronium (oPs) measurements with 44Sc.   Method: A NEMA image quality phantom was filled with 41.7 MBq of 44Sc dissolved in water and scanned on a commercial long-axial field-of-view PET/CT. Three-photon events were identified using a prototype feature of the scanner and dedicated software. The lifetime of oPs was determined in the phantom spheres and in 4x4x4 mm^3 voxels.   Results: All measured oPs lifetimes are compatible, within the uncertainties, with the literature values for water. The oPs lifetime is 2.65+-0.50, 1.39+-0.20 and 1.76+-0.18 ns in the three smallest spheres of the phantom and 1.79+-0.57 ns for a single voxel in the central region of the largest sphere. The relative standard deviation in the background regions of the time difference distributions, i.e., for time differences smaller than -2.7 ns, is above 20% - even for voxels inside the phantom spheres.   Conclusions: Despite the favorable physical properties of 44Sc, the count statistics of three-photon events remains a challenge. The high prompt-photon energy causes a significant amount of random three-photon coincidences with the given methodology and, therefore, increases the statistical uncertainties on the measured oPs lifetime.</td>
