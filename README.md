<td style='padding: 4px;'>Chimera states and bump states are collective synchronization phenomena observed independently (at different parameter regions) in networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators. And while chimera states are characterized by coexistence of coherent and incoherent domains, bump states consist of active domains operating on a silent background. Multistable plasticity in the network connections originates from brain dynamics and is based on the idea that neural cells may transmit inhibitory or excitatory signals depending on various factors, such as local connectivity, influence of neighboring cells etc. During the system/network integration, the link weights adapt and, in the case of multistability, they may organize in coexisting excitatory and/or inhibitory domains. Here, we explore the influence of bistable plasticity on collective synchronization states and we numerically demonstrate that the dynamics of the linking may give rise to co-existence of bump-like and chimera-like states simultaneously in the network. In the case of bump and chimera co-existence, confinement effects are developed: the different domains stay localized and do not travel around the network. Memory effects are also reported in the sense that the final spatial arrangement of the coupling strengths reflects some of the local properties of the initial link distribution. For the quantification of the system's spatial and temporal features, the global and local entropy functions are employed as measures of the network organization, while the average firing rates account for the network evolution and dynamics.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised pre-training of deep learning models with contrastive learning is a widely used technique in image analysis. Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains impacted by wave-front distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to those fundamental issues. As an experimental proof-of-concept, an in-vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheeps. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to drastically enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and non-ionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visual brain decoding aims to decode visual information from human brain activities. Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.Codes and models can be found at https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/TGBD.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Disease progression models infer group-level temporal trajectories of change in patients' features as a chronic degenerative condition plays out. They provide unique insight into disease biology and staging systems with individual-level clinical utility. Discrete models consider disease progression as a latent permutation of events, where each event corresponds to a feature becoming measurably abnormal. However, permutation inference using traditional maximum likelihood approaches becomes prohibitive due to combinatoric explosion, severely limiting model dimensionality and utility. Here we leverage ideas from optimal transport to model disease progression as a latent permutation matrix of events belonging to the Birkhoff polytope, facilitating fast inference via optimisation of the variational lower bound. This enables a factor of 1000 times faster inference than the current state of the art and, correspondingly, supports models with several orders of magnitude more features than the current state of the art can consider. Experiments demonstrate the increase in speed, accuracy and robustness to noise in simulation. Further experiments with real-world imaging data from two separate datasets, one from Alzheimer's disease patients, the other age-related macular degeneration, showcase, for the first time, pixel-level disease progression events in the brain and eye, respectively. Our method is low compute, interpretable and applicable to any progressive condition and data modality, giving it broad potential clinical utility.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Networks of nonlocally coupled leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons exhibit a variety of complex collective behaviors, such as partial synchronization, frequency or amplitude chimeras, solitary states and bump states. In particular, the bump states consist of one or many regions of asynchronous elements within a sea of quiescent subthreshold elements. The asynchronous domains (also called bumps) travel in the network in a direction predetermined by the initial conditions. In the present study we investigate the occurrence of bump states in networks of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons in two-dimensions using nonlocal toroidal connectivity and we explore possible mechanisms for stabilizing the moving asynchronous domains. Our findings indicate that I) incorporating a refractory period can effectively anchor the position of these domains in the network, and II) the switching off of some randomly preselected nodes (i.e., making them permanently idle/inactive) can likewise contribute to stabilizing the positions of the asynchronous domains. In particular, in case II for large values of the coupling strength and a large percentage of idle elements, all nodes acquire different fixed (frozen) values in the subthreshold region and oscillations cease throughout the network due to self-organization. For the special case of stationary bump states, we propose an analytical approach to predict their properties. This approach is based on the self-consistency argument and is valid for infinitely large networks. Case I is of particular biomedical interest in view of the importance of refractoriness for biological neurons, while case II can be biomedically relevant when designing therapeutic methods for stabilizing moving signals in the brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Monitoring of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) brain tumors in pediatric patients is key for assessment of treatment response. Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) guidelines recommend the volumetric measurement of these tumors using MRI. Segmentation challenges, such as the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge, promote development of automated approaches which are replicable, generalizable and accurate, to aid in these tasks. The current study presents a novel adaptation of existing nnU-Net approaches for pediatric brain tumor segmentation, submitted to the BraTS-PEDs 2024 challenge. We apply an adapted nnU-Net with hierarchical cascades to the segmentation task of the BraTS-PEDs 2024 challenge. The residual encoder variant of nnU-Net, used as our baseline model, already provides high quality segmentations. We incorporate multiple changes to the implementation of nnU-Net and devise a novel two-stage cascaded nnU-Net to segment the substructures of brain tumors from coarse to fine. Using outputs from the nnU-Net Residual Encoder (trained to segment CC, ED, ET and NET tumor labels from T1w, T1w-CE, T2w and T2-FLAIR MRI), these are passed to two additional models one classifying ET versus NET and a second classifying CC vs ED using cascade learning. We use radiological guidelines to steer which multi parametric MRI (mpMRI) to use in these cascading models. Compared to a default nnU-Net and an ensembled nnU-net as baseline approaches, our novel method provides robust segmentations for the BraTS-PEDs 2024 challenge, achieving mean Dice scores of 0.657, 0.904, 0.703, and 0.967, and HD95 of 76.2, 10.1, 111.0, and 12.3 for the ET, NET, CC and ED, respectively.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Over the past two decades, an increasing array of control-theoretic methods have been used to study the brain as a complex dynamical system and better understand its structure-function relationship. This article provides an overview on one such family of methods, based on the linear-threshold rate (LTR) dynamics, which arises when modeling the spiking activity of neuronal populations and their impact on each other. LTR dynamics exhibit a wide range of behaviors based on network topologies and inputs, including mono- and multi-stability, limit cycles, and chaos, allowing it to be used to model many complex brain processes involving fast and slow inhibition, multiple time and spatial scales, different types of neural behavior, and higher-order interactions. Here we investigate how the versatility of LTR dynamics paired with concepts and tools from systems and control can provide a computational theory for explaining the dynamical mechanisms enabling different brain processes. Specifically, we illustrate stability and stabilization properties of LTR dynamics and how they are related to goal-driven selective attention, multistability and its relationship with declarative memory, and bifurcations and oscillations and their role in modeling seizure dynamics in epilepsy. We conclude with a discussion on additional properties of LTR dynamics and an outlook on other brain processess that for which they might be play a similar role.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>EEG preprocessing varies widely between studies, but its impact on stimulus classification performance remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyzed seven experiments with 40 participants drawn from the public ERP CORE dataset. We systematically varied key preprocessing steps, such as filtering, referencing, baseline interval, detrending, and multiple artifact correction steps. Then we performed trial-wise binary classification (i.e., decoding) using neural networks (EEGNet), or time-resolved logistic regressions. Our findings demonstrate that preprocessing choices influenced decoding performance considerably. All artifact correction steps reduced decoding performance across all experiments and models, while higher high-pass filter cutoffs consistently enhanced decoding. For EEGNet, baseline correction further improved performance, and for time-resolved classifiers, linear detrending and lower low-pass filter cutoffs were beneficial. Other optimal preprocessing choices were specific for each experiment. The current results underline the importance of carefully selecting preprocessing steps for EEG-based decoding. If not corrected, artifacts facilitate decoding but compromise conclusive interpretation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mother-child interaction is a highly dynamic process neurally characterized by inter-brain synchrony (IBS) at {\theta} and/or {\alpha} rhythms. However, their establishment, dynamic changes, and roles in mother-child interactions remain unknown. Through dynamic analysis of dual-EEG from 40 mother-child dyads during turn-taking cooperation, we uncover that {\theta}-IBS and {\alpha}-IBS alternated with interactive behaviors, with EEG frequency-shift as a prerequisite for IBS transitions. When mothers attempt to track their children's attention and/or predict their intentions, they will adjust their EEG frequencies to align with their children's {\theta} oscillations, leading to a higher occurrence of the {\theta}-IBS state. Conversely, the {\alpha}-IBS state, accompanied by the EEG frequency-shift to the {\alpha} range, is more prominent during mother-led interactions. Further exploratory analysis reveals greater presence and stability of the {\theta}-IBS state during cooperative than non-cooperative conditions, particularly in dyads with stronger emotional attachments and more frequent interactions in their daily lives. Our findings shed light on the neural oscillational substrates underlying the IBS dynamics during mother-child interactions.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Despite the research and implementation efforts involving various safety strategies, protocols, and technologies, work zone crashes and fatalities continue to occur at an alarming rate each year. This study investigates the neurophysiological responses to Augmented Reality safety warnings in roadway work zones under varying workload conditions. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, we objectively assessed situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load in simulated low-intensity (LA) and moderate-intensity (MA) work activities. The research analyzed key EEG indicators including beta, gamma, alpha, and theta waves, as well as various combined wave ratios. Results revealed that AR warnings effectively triggered neurological responses associated with increased situational awareness and attention across both workload conditions. However, significant differences were observed in the timing and intensity of these responses. In the LA condition, peak responses occurred earlier (within 125 ms post-warning) and were more pronounced, suggesting a more robust cognitive response when physical demands were lower. Conversely, the MA condition showed delayed peak responses (125-250 ms post-warning) and more gradual changes, indicating a potential impact of increased physical activity on cognitive processing speed. These findings underscore the importance of considering physical workload when designing AR-based safety systems for roadway work zones. The research contributes to the understanding of how AR can enhance worker safety and provides insights for developing more effective, context-aware safety interventions in high-risk work environments.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>During clinical treatment for epilepsy, the area of the brain thought to be responsible for pathological activity - known as the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is identified. This is typically performed through visual assessment of EEG recordings; however, this is time consuming and prone to subjective inconsistency. Automated SOZ localisation algorithms provide objective identification of the SOZ by highlighting changes in signal features associated with seizure onset. In this work we investigate how methodological differences in such algorithms can result in different SOZ localisations.   We analysed ictal intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings in 16 subjects (100 seizures) with drug-resistant epilepsy from the SWEZ-ETHZ public database. Through our analysis, we identified a series of key methodological differences that must be considered when designing or selecting a SOZ localisation algorithm. These differences were demonstrated using three distinct algorithms that capture different, but complementary, seizure onset features: Imprint, Epileptogenicity Index (EI), and Low Entropy Map (LEM). We assessed methodological differences at each Decision Point, comparing the resultant SOZ localisations.   Our independent application of all three algorithms to the same ictal icEEG dataset revealed low agreement between algorithms: 27-60% of seizure onsets were as minimally or non-overlapping (<25% overlap). Therefore, we investigated the effect of three key methodological differences (or Decision Points). Changes at each Decision Point were found to result in significantly different SOZ localisations (p<0.05).   Our results demonstrate how seemingly small methodological changes can result in large differences in SOZ localisations. We propose that key Decision Points must be considered when using or designing a SOZ localisation algorithm.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Auditory attention decoding (AAD) is the process of identifying the attended speech in a multi-talker environment using brain signals, typically recorded through electroencephalography (EEG). Over the past decade, AAD has undergone continuous development, driven by its promising application in neuro-steered hearing devices. Most AAD algorithms are relying on the increase in neural entrainment to the envelope of attended speech, as compared to unattended speech, typically using a two-step approach. First, the algorithm predicts representations of the attended speech signal envelopes; second, it identifies the attended speech by finding the highest correlation between the predictions and the representations of the actual speech signals. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, named AADNet, which combines these two stages into a direct approach to address the AAD problem. We compare the proposed network against the traditional approaches, including linear stimulus reconstruction, canonical correlation analysis, and an alternative non-linear stimulus reconstruction using two different datasets. AADNet shows a significant performance improvement for both subject-specific and subject-independent models. Notably, the average subject-independent classification accuracies from 56.1 % to 82.7 % with analysis window lengths ranging from 1 to 40 seconds, respectively, show a significantly improved ability to generalize to data from unseen subjects. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models for advancing AAD, with promising implications for future hearing aids, assistive devices, and clinical assessments.</td>

We test a set of different activation functions and compare their performance. Our results show that introducing a higher degree polynomial activation function can enhance model performance without changing the model architecture. We also show that the learnable 3rd-degree activation function performs better on the 1-gram evaluation compared to a 3rd-degree non-learnable function.

Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious threat to the physical and mental health of adolescents, significantly increasing the risk of suicide and attracting widespread public concern. Electroencephalography (EEG), as an objective tool for identifying brain disorders, holds great promise. However, extracting meaningful and reliable features from high-dimensional EEG data, especially by integrating spatiotemporal brain dynamics into informative representations, remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce an advanced semi-supervised adversarial network, NSSI-Net, to effectively model EEG features related to NSSI. NSSI-Net consists of two key modules: a spatial-temporal feature extraction module and a multi-concept discriminator. In the spatial-temporal feature extraction module, an integrated 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) are used to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics in EEG data. In the multi-concept discriminator, signal, gender, domain, and disease levels are fully explored to extract meaningful EEG features, considering individual, demographic, disease variations across a diverse population. Based on self-collected NSSI data (n=114), the model's effectiveness and reliability are demonstrated, with a 7.44% improvement in performance compared to existing machine learning and deep learning methods. This study advances the understanding and early diagnosis of NSSI in adolescents with depression, enabling timely intervention.

This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants. The decoding analysis shows the feasibility of turn intention prediction for lower limb movement using the EEG signal before the event onset.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While end-to-end multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) learning approaches have shown significant promise, their applicability is often constrained in neurological diagnostics, such as intracranial EEG resources. When provided with a single-channel EEG, how can we learn representations that are robust to multi-channels and scalable across varied tasks, such as seizure prediction? In this paper, we present SplitSEE, a structurally splittable framework designed for effective temporal-frequency representation learning in single-channel EEG. The key concept of SplitSEE is a self-supervised framework incorporating a deep clustering task. Given an EEG, we argue that the time and frequency domains are two distinct perspectives, and hence, learned representations should share the same cluster assignment. To this end, we first propose two domain-specific modules that independently learn domain-specific representation and address the temporal-frequency tradeoff issue in conventional spectrogram-based methods. Then, we introduce a novel clustering loss to measure the information similarity. This encourages representations from both domains to coherently describe the same input by assigning them a consistent cluster. SplitSEE leverages a pre-training-to-fine-tuning framework within a splittable architecture and has following properties: (a) Effectiveness: it learns representations solely from single-channel EEG but has even outperformed multi-channel baselines. (b) Robustness: it shows the capacity to adapt across different channels with low performance variance. Superior performance is also achieved with our collected clinical dataset. (c) Scalability: With just one fine-tuning epoch, SplitSEE achieves high and stable performance using partial model layers.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.</td>

The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on voluntary right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a sampling frequency 200Hz in the laboratory experiment. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive control system. Various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, random forest, and a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) attention-based model, were developed. The random forest model obtained 79% accuracy. Great performance was seen on the Logistic Regression model which outperforms other models with 92% accuracy and 91% accuracy on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The Bi-LSTM attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 86% through cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI applications.</td>

This study addresses the challenges of detecting P300 event-related potentials in electroencephalograms (EEGs) and integrating these P300 responses for character spelling, particularly within oddball paradigms characterized by uneven P300 distribution, low target probability, and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This work proposes a weighted ensemble spatio-sequential convolutional neural network (WE-SPSQ-CNN) to improve classification accuracy and SNR by mitigating signal variability for character identification. We evaluated the proposed WE-SPSQ-CNN on dataset II from the BCI Competition III, achieving P300 classification accuracies of 69.7\% for subject A and 79.9\% for subject B across fifteen epochs. For character recognition, the model achieved average accuracies of 76.5\%, 87.5\%, and 94.5\% with five, ten, and fifteen repetitions, respectively.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a technique used to optimize and reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of machine learning models. It has been used primarily for neural networks. For Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that are fully portable and usable in various situations, it is necessary to provide approaches that are lightweight for storage and computation. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of post-training quantization on state-of-the-art approaches in brain-computer interfaces and assess their impact on accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the single-trial detection of event-related potentials representing one major BCI paradigm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve drops from 0.861 to 0.825 with PTQ when applied on both spatial filters and the classifier, while reducing the size of the model by about $\times$ 15. The results support the conclusion that PTQ can substantially reduce the memory footprint of the models while keeping roughly the same level of accuracy.</td>

Our methods involve training an offline SSVEP classification model, implementing the robot self-navigation algorithm, and finally deploy the model online for real-time robot operation.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The cognitive mechanisms underlying subjects' self-regulation in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and neurofeedback (NF) training remain poorly understood. Yet, a mechanistic computational model of each individual learning trajectory is required to improve the reliability of BCI applications. The few existing attempts mostly rely on model-free (reinforcement learning) approaches. Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training. We show how simple changes in model parameters allow us to qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject. In the near future, this approach may provide a powerful computational to model individual skill learning and thus optimize and finely characterize BCI training.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The multimodal model has demonstrated promise in histopathology. However, most multimodal models are based on H\&E and genomics, adopting increasingly complex yet black-box designs. In our paper, we propose a novel interpretable multimodal framework named SHAP-CAT, which uses a Shapley-value-based dimension reduction technique for effective multimodal fusion. Starting with two paired modalities -- H\&E and IHC images, we employ virtual staining techniques to enhance limited input data by generating a new clinical-related modality. Lightweight bag-level representations are extracted from image modalities and a Shapley-value-based mechanism is used for dimension reduction. For each dimension of the bag-level representation, attribution values are calculated to indicate how changes in the specific dimensions of the input affect the model output. In this way, we select a few top important dimensions of bag-level representation for each image modality to late fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SHAP-CAT framework incorporating synthetic modalities significantly enhances model performance, yielding a 5\% increase in accuracy for the BCI, an 8\% increase for IHC4BC-ER, and an 11\% increase for the IHC4BC-PR dataset.</td>

In this paper, we propose Professor X, an invisible and robust "mind-controller" that can arbitrarily manipulate the outputs of EEG BCI through backdoor attack, to alert the EEG community of the potential hazard. However, existing EEG attacks mainly focus on single-target class attacks, and they either require engaging the training stage of the target BCI, or fail to maintain high stealthiness. Addressing these limitations, Professor X exploits a three-stage clean label poisoning attack: 1) selecting one trigger for each class; 2) learning optimal injecting EEG electrodes and frequencies strategy with reinforcement learning for each trigger; 3) generating poisoned samples by injecting the corresponding trigger's frequencies into poisoned data for each class by linearly interpolating the spectral amplitude of both data according to previously learned strategies. Experiments on datasets of three common EEG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Professor X, which also easily bypasses existing backdoor defenses.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Visual brain decoding aims to decode visual information from human brain activities. Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.Codes and models can be found at https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/TGBD.</td>

Initial research concentrated on the use of fMRI data, but fMRI was deemed to be not suitable for real-world applications, and soon, research shifted towards using EEG data. In this paper, we try to improve the original performance of a first attempt at generating text using EEG by focusing on the less explored area of optimising neural network performance. We test a set of different activation functions and compare their performance. Our results show that introducing a higher degree polynomial activation function can enhance model performance without changing the model architecture. We also show that the learnable 3rd-degree activation function performs better on the 1-gram evaluation compared to a 3rd-degree non-learnable function. However, when evaluating the model on 2-grams and above, the polynomial function lacks in performance, whilst the leaky ReLU activation function outperforms the baseline.</td>

However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Predicting the neural response to natural images in the visual cortex requires extracting relevant features from the images and relating those feature to the observed responses. In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities on textual data. We explore whether these capabilities can be extended to continuous vectors from diverse domains, obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. By aligning input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors, we observe that LLMs can effectively process and learn from these projected vectors, which we term Vector-ICL. In particular, we find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. In our experiments across various tasks and modalities, including text reconstruction, numerical function regression, text classification, summarization, molecule captioning, time-series classification, graph classification, and fMRI decoding, Vector-ICL often surpasses both few-shot ICL and domain-specific model or tuning. We further conduct analyses and case studies, indicating the potential of LLMs to process vector representations beyond traditional token-based paradigms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities.</td>

However, fMRI datasets remain relatively small in scale, and the inherent issue of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in fMRI data further exacerbates these challenges. To address this, we apply compression techniques as a preprocessing step for fMRI data. We propose BrainCodec, a novel fMRI codec inspired by the neural audio codec. We evaluated BrainCodec's compression capability in mental state decoding, demonstrating further improvements over previous methods. Furthermore, we analyzed the latent representations obtained through BrainCodec, elucidating the similarities and differences between task and resting state fMRI, highlighting the interpretability of BrainCodec. Additionally, we demonstrated that fMRI reconstructions using BrainCodec can enhance the visibility of brain activity by achieving higher SNR, suggesting its potential as a novel denoising method. Our study shows that BrainCodec not only enhances performance over previous methods but also offers new analytical possibilities for neuroscience.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people globally, with EEG/MEG-based spike detection playing a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications.</td>

Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding the morphology of galaxies is a critical aspect of astrophysics research, providing insight into the formation, evolution, and physical properties of these vast cosmic structures. Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\sim200$ for 2D images and $\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present the CO(1-0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100GHz continuum in 16 of 28 galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to "enhanced" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The pursuit of the genuine fundamental description, governing nature at some high-energy scale, must invariably consider the yet-unknown mechanism behind the generation of neutrino mass. Lepton-flavor violating decays $l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta$, allowed in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing, provide a mean to look for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we consider the inverse seesaw mechanism and then revisit the calculation of its contributions to the branching ratios of the aforementioned decay processes, among which we find $\mu\to\gamma\,e$ to be more promising, in the light of current bounds by the MEG Collaboration. Deviations from unitarity in the mixing of light neutrinos are related to the branching ratios ${\rm Br}\big( l_\alpha\to\gamma\,l_\beta \big)$ in a simple manner, which we address, then finding that, while experimental data are consistent with current bounds on non-unitarity effects, the upcoming MEG II update shall be able to improve restrictions on such effects by a factor $\sim\frac{1}{3}$.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Abnormality detection in the identification of a single-subject which deviates from the majority of the dataset that comes from a control group is a critical problem. A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \( t \) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Mobile edge generation (MEG) is an emerging technology that allows the network to meet the challenging traffic load expectations posed by the rise of generative artificial intelligence~(GAI). A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</td>

They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases.

This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come.</td>

The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Self-supervised pre-training of deep learning models with contrastive learning is a widely used technique in image analysis. Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains impacted by wave-front distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to those fundamental issues. As an experimental proof-of-concept, an in-vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheeps. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to drastically enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and non-ionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Continuum robots, known for their high flexibility and adaptability, offer immense potential for applications such as medical surgery, confined-space inspections, and wearable devices. However, their non-linear elastic properties and complex kinematics present significant challenges in digital modeling and effective control. This research proposes a novel computational framework that integrates Lie group kinematics with an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to identify optimal control coefficients for specific robot models. Our method starts by generating datasets from physics-based simulations and fractional order control, defining both ideal configurations and models to be optimized. By using EA, we iteratively minimize deviations through two fitness objectives \textemdash deviation mean squared error (\(\text{MSE}_1\)) and TCP vector error (\(\text{MSE}_2\)) \textemdash to align the robot's backbone with the desired configuration. Built on the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) platform Grasshopper, this framework provides real-time visualization, enabling dynamic control of robot configurations. Results show that the proposed method achieves precise alignment of the robot's backbone with minimal computation. This approach not only simplifies the coefficient identification process but also demonstrates the advantages of EA in multi-objective optimization, contributing to efficient modeling and control of continuum robots.</td>

Additionally, while human coders assign ICD codes, the inclusion of irrelevant information from unrelated experts introduces biases. To combat these issues, we propose a novel method to mitigate Demographic and Expert biases in ICD coding through Causal Inference (DECI). We provide a novel causality-based interpretation in ICD Coding that models make predictions by three distinct pathways. And based counterfactual reasoning, DECI mitigate demographic and expert biases. Experimental results show that DECI outperforms state-of-the-art models, offering a significant advancement in accurate and unbiased ICD coding.</td>

In order to distinguish the respective effects of the structure and the composition on cell differentiation, beads-on-string fibers were used to manufacture thick honeycomb-like scaffolds without nHA. Mechanical and biological impacts of those beads-on string fibers were evaluated. Uniaxial tensile test showed that beads-on-string fibers decreased the Young Modulus and maximal stress but kept them appropriate for tissue engineering. C3H10T1/2 were seeded and cultured for 6 days on the scaffolds without any growth factors. Viability assays revealed the biocompatibility of the beads-on-string scaffolds, with adequate cells-materials interactions observed by confocal microscopy. Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed at day 6 in order to compare the early differentiation of cells to bone fate. The measure of stained area and intensity confirmed the beneficial effect of both honeycomb structure and nHA, independently. Finally, we showed that honeycomb-like electrospun scaffolds could be relevant candidates for promoting bone fate to cells in the absence of nHA. It offers an easier and faster manufacture process, in particular in bone-interface tissue engineering, permitting to avoid the dispersion of nHA and their interaction with the other cells.</td>

This study employs the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Geant4 to evaluate various configurations and materials of detector crystals. We concentrate on three critical parameters: sensitivity, intrinsic coincidence time resolution (CTR), and energy resolution across three crystal designs: 1)standard LYSO crystals as the baseline; 2)0.1% Mg, 1% Ce doped $Gd_3Al_2Ga_3O_{12}$ (Mg,Ce:GAGG) as an alternative material; and 3)pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals, which maintain the same dimensions as the standard LYSO. The research is grounded in the geometric configuration of the uEXPLORER. Our findings reveal that pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals exhibit superior performance, achieving an impressive CTR of 42 ps. In contrast, PET detectors utilizing doped GAGG crystals demonstrate a 6% reduction in intrinsic CTR compared to LYSO. However, Mg,Ce:GAGG crystals surpass LYSO in energy resolution by 25%, while cuboidal LYSO crystals achieve approximately 37% greater sensitivity than their Mg,Ce:GAGG counterparts. These results underscore the impact of different crystal materials and geometries on PET scanner performance, emphasizing the trade-offs among sensitivity, coincidence time resolution (CTR), and energy resolution. Such insights are pivotal for informing the design of future TB-PET systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Annotating 3D medical images demands expert knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have gained significant interest in 3D medical image segmentation. The significant size differences among various organs in the human body lead to imbalanced class distribution, which is a major challenge in the real-world application of these SSL approaches. To address this issue, we develop a novel Shape Transformation driven by Active Contour (STAC), that enlarges smaller organs to alleviate imbalanced class distribution across different organs. Inspired by curve evolution theory in active contour methods, STAC employs a signed distance function (SDF) as the level set function, to implicitly represent the shape of organs, and deforms voxels in the direction of the steepest descent of SDF (i.e., the normal vector). To ensure that the voxels far from expansion organs remain unchanged, we design an SDF-based weight function to control the degree of deformation for each voxel. We then use STAC as a data-augmentation process during the training stage. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

However, doctor-patient dialogue datasets are not readily available, primarily due to privacy regulations. Moreover, existing datasets lack comprehensive annotations involving medical slots and their different attributes, such as symptoms and their onset, progression, and severity. These comprehensive annotations are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Finally, most existing datasets are non-English, limiting their utility for the larger research community.

Collaborating with doctors, we devise a questionnaire-based labeling scheme tailored to the medical domain. Then, medical professionals create the dataset with high-quality comprehensive annotations, capturing medical slots and their attributes.
