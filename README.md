<td style='padding: 4px;'>The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type (chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration, and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs (customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central goal in many brain studies is the identification of those brain regions that are activated during an observation window that may correspond to a motor task, a stimulus, or simply a resting state. While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Low-field T2 mapping MRI can democratize neuropediatric imaging by improving accessibility and providing quantitative biomarkers of brain development. \textbf{Purpose:} To evaluate the feasibility of high-resolution T2 mapping using a single-shot fast spin-echo (SS-FSE) sequence at 0.55~T in a healthy control cohort. \textbf{Study Type:} Prospective single-center study. \textbf{Population:} In vivo: ten healthy adults (18--43~years, 5 females/5 males). In vitro: NIST Phantom. \textbf{Field strength/sequence:} Multi-echo ultra-fast spin-echo at 0.55~T and 1.5~T. \textbf{Assessment:} Feasibility was first assessed in vitro using the NIST Phantom, comparing T2 relaxation times to spectrometer references at 0.55~T. Acquisition and T2-fitting parameters optimized in vitro were applied in vivo. Repeatability was evaluated by atlas-based analysis of white matter (WM) and cortical grey matter (GM) regions. Coefficients of variation (CoV) were computed across runs, sessions, and subjects. \textbf{Statistical Tests:} Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.05/n_{ROI}$) assessed CoV differences. Pearson correlation coefficients quantified T2 associations. \textbf{Results:} In vitro, mono-exponential fitting under Gaussian--Rician noise yielded deviations $<12\%$ from reference values. In vivo, inter-subject CoV was 5.2\% (WM) and 17.7\% (GM), comparable to 1.5~T. Mean T2 times were 118~ms (WM) and 188~ms (GM) at 0.55~T, with a 16.5-minute acquisition. \textbf{Conclusion:} A rapid, robust high-resolution T2 mapping protocol at 0.55~T for HASTE MRI is presented, employing Gaussian noise-based fitting. We report the first normative T2 values for healthy adult brains at 0.55~T, demonstrating technical feasibility and reliability.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deep learning is widely applied to modern problems through neural networks, but the growing computational and energy demands of these models have driven interest in more efficient approaches. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the third generation of neural networks, mimic the brain's event-driven behaviour, offering improved performance and reduced power use. At the same time, concerns about data privacy during cloud-based model execution have led to the adoption of cryptographic methods. This article introduces BioEncryptSNN, a spiking neural network based encryption-decryption framework for secure and noise-resilient data protection. Unlike conventional algorithms, BioEncryptSNN converts ciphertext into spike trains and exploits temporal neural dynamics to model encryption and decryption, optimising parameters such as key length, spike timing, and synaptic connectivity. Benchmarked against AES-128, RSA-2048, and DES, BioEncryptSNN preserved data integrity while achieving up to 4.1x faster encryption and decryption than PyCryptodome's AES implementation. The framework demonstrates scalability and adaptability across symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, positioning SNNs as a promising direction for secure, energy-efficient computing.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths. However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement, increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate (ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications in early Alzheimer disease detection.</td>

To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution. These results position configurations as a principled computational model of early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however, obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is, and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference, Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence without statistical thought.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Recent promising results in auditory attention decoding (AAD) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have motivated the exploration of cEEGrid, a flexible and portable ear-EEG system. While prior cEEGrid-based studies have confirmed the feasibility of AAD, they often neglect the dynamic nature of attentional states in real-world contexts. To address this gap, a novel cEEGrid dataset featuring three concurrent speakers distributed across three of five distinct spatial locations is introduced. The novel dataset is designed to probe attentional tracking and switching in realistic scenarios. Nested leave-one-out validation-an approach more rigorous than conventional single-loop leave-one-out validation-is employed to reduce biases stemming from EEG's intricate temporal dynamics. Four rule-based models are evaluated: Wiener filter (WF), canonical component analysis (CCA), common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian Geometry-based classifier (RGC). With a 30-second decision window, WF and CCA models achieve decoding accuracies of 41.5% and 41.4%, respectively, while CSP and RGC models yield 37.8% and 37.6% accuracies using a 10-second window. Notably, both WF and CCA successfully track attentional state switches across all experimental tasks. Additionally, higher decoding accuracies are observed for electrodes positioned at the upper cEEGrid layout and near the listener's right ear. These findings underscore the utility of dynamic, ecologically valid paradigms and rigorous validation in advancing AAD research with cEEGrid.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>For real-world BCI applications, lightweight Electroencephalography (EEG) systems offer the best cost-deployment balance. However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs. power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40 Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution. This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp type during planning using noninvasive EEG.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition, a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level, fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\% for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of both EEG and ECoG signals.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust, reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG, speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In neuroscience, methods from information geometry (IG) have been successfully applied in the modelling of binary vectors from spike train data, using the orthogonal decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information to isolate different orders of interaction between neurons. While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>For real-world BCI applications, lightweight Electroencephalography (EEG) systems offer the best cost-deployment balance. However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.</td>

Traditional channel selection methods struggle to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings. EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy, achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural signal relevance.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential technique for neuroscience research and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recently, large-scale EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.</td>

However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97% majority regions of interest).

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for (i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions (BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and {Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically, when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks (including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Many analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examine functional connectivity (FC), or the statistical dependencies among distant brain regions. These analyses are typically exploratory, guiding future confirmatory research. In this work, we present an approach based on factor analysis (FA) that is well-suited to studying FC. FA is appealing in this context because its flexible model assumptions permit a guided investigation of its target subspace consistent with the exploratory role of connectivity analyses. However, applying FA to fMRI data poses three problems: (1) its target subspace captures short-range spatial dependencies that should be treated as noise, (2) it requires factorization of a massive spatial covariance, and (3) it overlooks temporal dependencies in the data. To address these limitations, we develop a factor model within the framework of functional data analysis--a field which views certain data as arising from smooth underlying curves. The proposed approach (1) uses matrix completion techniques to filter short-range spatial dependencies out of its target subspace, (2) employs a distributed algorithm for factorizing large-scale covariance matrices, and (3) leverages functional regression to exploit temporal dynamics. Together, these innovations yield a comprehensive and scalable method for studying FC.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>In recent years, the alignment between artificial neural network (ANN) embeddings and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) via neural encoding models has significantly advanced research on neural representation mechanisms and interpretability in the brain. However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli is an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets, four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and overlapping information.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>A central goal in many brain studies is the identification of those brain regions that are activated during an observation window that may correspond to a motor task, a stimulus, or simply a resting state. While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties, including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49) compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in computational neuroscience and neural decoding.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition to spanning large redshift ($0<z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges ($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood. We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Decoding visual information from time-resolved brain recordings, such as EEG and MEG, plays a pivotal role in real-time brain-computer interfaces. However, existing approaches primarily focus on direct brain-image feature alignment and are limited to single-task frameworks or task-specific models. In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Quantum-like modeling (QLM) - quantum theory applications outside of physics - are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on mental entanglement detection using the EEG/MEG technique.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

<td style='padding: 4px;'>NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first "composition" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones. Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.   To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.   Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.</td>

In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies, their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2) models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated. These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

To address this need, we employ coherent beam combining (CBC) through adaptive phase control to precisely craft far-field intensity distributions. We present a comprehensive framework comprising two complementary strategies: (i) dynamic beam shaping through sequential steering, enabling programmable trajectories and arbitrary patterns for versatile energy delivery, and (ii) static shaping via iterative phase optimization, producing target defined profiles such as rings, squares, and triangles. Rapid reconfiguration of beam profiles and steering is achieved through optimized phase-control algorithms. Among the tested methods, a deep-learning-inspired Adagrad optimization approach demonstrated the fastest and most stable convergence, ensuring scalability and robustness. The proposed strategy significantly enhances power delivery efficiency and beam uniformity compared to conventional shaping techniques. This dual-mode CBC framework establishes a versatile and resilient platform for adaptive laser beam control, with transformative potential across industrial manufacturing, materials processing, medical systems, directed-energy applications, and tunable light-field research.</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility</td>

<td style='padding: 4px;'>Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications in early Alzheimer disease detection.</td>
