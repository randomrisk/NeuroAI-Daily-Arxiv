      "abstract": "Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces. However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging, remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.",

      "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments. Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.",

Deep learning-based brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\\% accuracy on the 7K-DS dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\\% and 99.85\\% in the 3-class and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model generalizes with 95.77\\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor localization.

At the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction, skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a 3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of generalizable brain MRI foundation models.",

However, how structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner.

We introduce the Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both (i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private subspaces.

      "abstract": "Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain. Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging.",

      "abstract": "The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.",

While prior cEEGrid-based studies have confirmed the feasibility of AAD, they often neglect the dynamic nature of attentional states in real-world contexts. To address this gap, a novel cEEGrid dataset featuring three concurrent speakers distributed across three of five distinct spatial locations is introduced. The novel dataset is designed to probe attentional tracking and switching in realistic scenarios. Nested leave-one-out validation-an approach more rigorous than conventional single-loop leave-one-out validation-is employed to reduce biases stemming from EEG's intricate temporal dynamics. Four rule-based models are evaluated: Wiener filter (WF), canonical component analysis (CCA), common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian Geometry-based classifier (RGC). With a 30-second decision window, WF and CCA models achieve decoding accuracies of 41.5% and 41.4%, respectively, while CSP and RGC models yield 37.8% and 37.6% accuracies using a 10-second window. Notably, both WF and CCA successfully track attentional state switches across all experimental tasks. Additionally, higher decoding accuracies are observed for electrodes positioned at the upper cEEGrid layout and near the listener's right ear.

However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.",

The platform isolates grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs. power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\\%) for precision vs. power discrimination, compared to 61.1\\% using MRCP.

To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals.

Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization.

We evaluate handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust, reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG, speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.",

While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.",

Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.",

Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.",

However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.",

Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization.

We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures.

We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network.

      "abstract": "Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Many analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examine functional connectivity (FC), or the statistical dependencies among distant brain regions. These analyses are typically exploratory, guiding future confirmatory research. In this work, we present an approach based on factor analysis (FA) that is well-suited to studying FC. FA is appealing in this context because its flexible model assumptions permit a guided investigation of its target subspace consistent with the exploratory role of connectivity analyses. However, applying FA to fMRI data poses three problems: (1) its target subspace captures short-range spatial dependencies that should be treated as noise, (2) it requires factorization of a massive spatial covariance, and (3) it overlooks temporal dependencies in the data. To address these limitations, we develop a factor model within the framework of functional data analysis--a field which views certain data as arising from smooth underlying curves. The proposed approach (1) uses matrix completion techniques to filter short-range spatial dependencies out of its target subspace, (2) employs a distributed algorithm for factorizing large-scale covariance matrices, and (3) leverages functional regression to exploit temporal dynamics. Together, these innovations yield a comprehensive and scalable method for studying FC.",

However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.",

      "abstract": "The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli is an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets, four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and overlapping information.",

While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.",

We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset.

In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement.

FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity.

QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

      "abstract": "Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior.

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

The accompanying Acoustic Emission (AE) event rate is known to increase as failure progresses. Here we examine the progression of the AE event rate for both rock and bone under conditions where failure progresses under fixed loading. The experiments for rock entail subjecting granite beams to a fixed loading under three point bending and monitoring the time-dependent failure. For bone, human cadaver skulls are loaded under pinning loads similar to those used for immobilization of the head for neurosurgical procedures. AE rates are shown to be consistent with a rate dependent material failure law including a quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate in the lead up to failure that is shown here to arise because of a coupling wherein a response rate is a power law of a driver and the driver is, in turn, a power law of the accumulated response. For both materials and experimental configurations this cascade provides warning of impending failure. For granite beams there is accurate prediction of failure time over the final 30 percent of the specimens lifetimes, which ranged from 35 seconds to two days. For skull fracture, the commencement of the failure cascade provides 30-70 seconds for warning of failure, which would be sufficient for basic remedial action to avoid patient injury in a surgical application.",

In domains such as climate and healthcare, these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme events improving from 3% to 78%.",

This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

      "abstract": "Many multiobjective real-world problems, such as facility location and bus routing, become more complex when optimizing the priorities of multiple stakeholders. These are often modeled using infinite classes of objectives, e.g., $L_p$ norms over group distances induced by feasible solutions in a fixed domain. Traditionally, the literature has considered explicitly balancing `equity' (or min-max) and `efficiency' (or min-sum) objectives to capture this trade-off. However, the structure of solutions obtained by such modeling choices can be very different. Taking a solution-centric approach, we introduce the concept of provably small set of solutions $P$, called a {\\it portfolio}, such that for every objective function $h(\\cdot)$ in the given class $\\mathbf{C}$, there exists some solution in $P$ which is an $\\alpha$-approximation for $h(\\cdot)$. Constructing such portfolios can help decision-makers understand the impact of balancing across multiple objectives.   Given a finite set of base objectives $h_1, \\ldots, h_N$, we give provable algorithms for constructing portfolios for (1) the class of conic combinations $\\mathbf{C} = \\{\\sum_{j \\in [N]}\\lambda_j h_j: \\lambda \\ge 0\\}$ and for (2) any class $\\mathbf{C}$ of functions that interpolates monotonically between the min-sum efficiency objective (i.e., $h_1 + \\ldots + h_N$) and the min-max equity objective (i.e., $\\max_{j \\in [N]} h_j$). Examples of the latter are $L_p$ norms and top-$\\ell$ norms. As an application, we study the Fair Subsidized Facility Location (FSFL) problem, motivated by the crisis of medical deserts caused due to pharmacy closures. FSFL allows subsidizing facilities in underserved areas using revenue from profitable locations.

Proteoglycans, essential constituents of the extracellular matrix, contribute to tissue swelling, stiffness, and viscoelasticity, thanks to the fixed charge density. Degenerative alterations in proteoglycan content and collagen structure - key indicators of diseases such as osteoarthritis - compromise the mechanical integrity of articular cartilage, underscoring the importance of early detection. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable compositional information, its limited spatial resolution restricts its effectiveness in evaluating thin soft tissues such as articular cartilage. As an alternative, contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging circumvents such limitation, resorting to the use of radiopaque contrast agents. In this context, cationic contrast agents, like CA4+, enable the quantitative assessment of proteoglycan content via electrostatic attraction. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography offers an optimal compromise between spatial resolution and radiation exposure, making it a promising tool for clinical use.

Leveraging an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner.
