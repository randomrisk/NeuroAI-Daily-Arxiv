      "abstract": "Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) aims at showing local differences in brain volumes with respect to a common template. TBM images are smooth but they exhibit (especially in diseased groups) higher values in some brain regions called lateral ventricles. More specifically, our voxelwise analysis shows both a mean-variance relationship in these areas and evidence of spatially dependent skewness. We propose a model for 3-dimensional functional data where mean, variance, and skewness functions vary smoothly across brain locations. We model the voxelwise distributions as skew-normal. The smooth effects of age and sex are estimated on a reference population of cognitively normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and mapped across the whole brain. The three parameter functions allow to transform each TBM image (in the reference population as well as in a test set) into a Gaussian process. These subject-specific normative maps are used to derive indices of deviation from a healthy condition to assess the individual risk of pathological degeneration."

SBoRA further reduces the computational and memory requirements of LoRA while enhancing learning performance. By leveraging orthogonal standard basis vectors to initialize one of the low-rank matrices, either A or B, SBoRA enables regional weight updates and memory-efficient fine-tuning. This approach gives rise to two variants, SBoRA-FA and SBoRA-FB, where only one of the matrices is updated, resulting in a sparse update matrix with a majority of zero rows or columns. Consequently, the majority of the fine-tuned model's weights remain unchanged from the pre-trained weights. This characteristic of SBoRA, wherein regional weight updates occur, is reminiscent of the modular organization of the human brain, which efficiently adapts to new tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of SBoRA-FA over LoRA in various fine-tuning tasks, including commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of QSBoRA on quantized LLaMA models of varying scales, highlighting its potential for efficient adaptation to new tasks.

      "abstract": "In neuroimaging, generally, brain CT is more cost-effective and accessible imaging option compared to MRI. Nevertheless, CT exhibits inferior soft-tissue contrast and higher noise levels, yielding less precise structural clarity. In response, leveraging more readily available CT to construct its counterpart MRI, namely, medical image-to-image translation (I2I), serves as a promising solution. Particularly, while diffusion models (DMs) have recently risen as a powerhouse, they also come with a few practical caveats for medical I2I. First, DMs' inherent stochasticity from random noise sampling cannot guarantee consistent MRI generation that faithfully reflects its CT. Second, for 3D volumetric images which are prevalent in medical imaging, naively using 2D DMs leads to slice inconsistency, e.g., abnormal structural and brightness changes. While 3D DMs do exist, significant training costs and data dependency bring hesitation. As a solution, we propose novel style key conditioning (SKC) and inter-slice trajectory alignment (ISTA) sampling for the 2D Brownian bridge diffusion model. Specifically, SKC ensures a consistent imaging style (e.g., contrast) across slices, and ISTA interconnects the independent sampling of each slice, deterministically achieving style and shape consistent 3D CT-to-MRI translation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to achieve high-quality 3D medical I2I based only on a 2D DM with no extra architectural models. Our experimental results show superior 3D medical I2I than existing 2D and 3D baselines, using in-house CT-MRI dataset and BraTS2023 FLAIR-T1 MRI dataset.",

This study aims to predict the primary tumor site from BM MRI data using radiomic features and advanced machine learning algorithms. Methods: We utilized a comprehensive dataset from Ocana-Tienda et al. (2023) comprising MRI and clinical data from 75 patients with BMs. Radiomic features were extracted from post-contrast T1-weighted MRI sequences. Feature selection was performed using the GINI index, and data normalization was applied to ensure consistent scaling. We developed and evaluated Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, both with and without hyperparameter optimization using the FOX (Fox optimizer) algorithm. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. Results: The baseline Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 0.85, which improved to 0.93 with FOX optimization. The XGBoost model showed an initial accuracy of 0.96, increasing to 0.99 after optimization. SHAP analysis revealed the most influential radiomic features contributing to the models' predictions. The FOX-optimized XGBoost model exhibited the best performance with a precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.99. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using radiomic features and machine learning to predict primary tumor sites from BM MRI data. The FOX optimization algorithm significantly enhanced model performance, and SHAP provided valuable insights into feature importance. These findings highlight the potential of integrating radiomics and machine learning into clinical practice for improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment planning.",

      "abstract": "If neuroscientists were asked which brain area is responsible for object recognition in primates, most would probably answer infero-temporal (IT) cortex. While IT is likely responsible for fine discriminations, and it is accordingly dominated by foveal visual inputs, there is more to object recognition than fine discrimination. Importantly, foveation of an object of interest usually requires recognizing, with reasonable confidence, its presence in the periphery. Arguably, IT plays a secondary role in such peripheral recognition, and other visual areas might instead be more critical. To investigate how signals carried by early visual processing areas (such as LGN and V1) could be used for object recognition in the periphery, we focused here on the task of distinguishing faces from non-faces. We tested how sensitive various models were to nuisance parameters, such as changes in scale and orientation of the image, and the type of image background. We found that a model of V1 simple or complex cells could provide quite reliable information, resulting in performance better than 80% in realistic scenarios. An LGN model performed considerably worse. Because peripheral recognition is both crucial to enable fine recognition (by bringing an object of interest on the fovea), and probably sufficient to account for a considerable fraction of our daily recognition-guided behavior, we think that the current focus on area IT and foveal processing is too narrow. We propose that rather than a hierarchical system with IT-like properties as its primary aim, object recognition should be seen as a parallel process, with high-accuracy foveal modules operating in parallel with lower-accuracy and faster modules that can operate across the visual field."

      "abstract": "Brain age estimation involves predicting the biological age of individuals from their brain images, which offers valuable insights into the aging process and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Conducting large-scale datasets for medical image analysis is a challenging and time-consuming task. Existing approaches mostly depend on large datasets, which are hard to come by and expensive. These approaches also require sophisticated, resource-intensive models with a large number of parameters, necessitating a considerable amount of processing power. As a result, there is a vital need to develop innovative methods that can achieve robust performance with limited datasets and efficient use of computational resources. This paper proposes a novel slice-based dual-stream method called GDSM (Greedy Dual-Stream Model) for brain age estimation. This method addresses the limitations of large dataset requirements and computational resource intensiveness. The proposed method incorporates local and global aspects of the brain, thereby refining the focus on specific target regions. The approach employs four backbones to predict ages based on local and global features, complemented by a final model for age correction. Our method demonstrates a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.25 years on the test set of IBID, which only contains 289 subjects. To demonstrate the robustness of our approach for any small dataset, we analyzed the proposed method with the IXI dataset and achieved an MAE of 4.18 years on the test set of IXI. By leveraging dual-stream and greedy strategies, this approach achieves efficiency and robust performance, making it comparable with other state-of-the-art methods.

Considering many users struggle with effective control of MI-BCI systems, a more user-centered approach to training might help motivate users and facilitate learning, alleviating inefficiency of the BCI system. With the increase of BCI-controlled games, researchers have suggested using game principles for BCI training, as games are naturally centered on the player. This review identifies and evaluates the application of game design elements to MI-BCI training, a process known as gamification. Through a systematic literature search, we examined how MI-BCI training protocols have been gamified and how specific game elements impacted the training outcomes. We identified 86 studies that employed gamified MI-BCI protocols in the past decade. The prevalence and reported effects of individual game elements on user experience and performance were extracted and synthesized. Results reveal that MI-BCI training protocols are most often gamified by having users move an avatar in a virtual environment that provides visual feedback. Furthermore, in these virtual environments, users were provided with goals that guided their actions. Using gamification, the reviewed protocols allowed users to reach effective MI-BCI control, with studies reporting positive effects of four individual elements on user performance and experience, namely: feedback, avatars, assistance, and social interaction. Based on these elements, this review makes current and future recommendations for effective gamification, such as the use of virtual reality and adaptation of game difficulty to user skill level."

However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly model the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential efficiency gains from information borrowing across brain regions. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant associations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modeling spatial dependency between QTs, with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we developed a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to account for dependencies between QTs. We incorporated a population-level mixed effects term into the model, taking full advantage of the dependent structure of brain imaging-derived QTs. Secondly, we implemented the model in the Bayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to achieve the model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the Cauchy combination test (CCT) to examine the association between SNPs and QTs, which avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation studies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic models where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled. We also applied the new spatial model to an imaging dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database."

This module captures global and local information at the graph level, ensuring that BDSAG features remain intact while enhancing effective feature expression capability. Furthermore, to deploy our method on the fourth-generation Raspberry Pi, we utilize Adaptive Pruning Optimization (APO) on both channels and neurons, reducing inference latency by almost half.

This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG."

Such mental impediments can permanently alter the neurological pathways in work and significantly decrease the quality of life (QoL). It is critical to translate brain signals into images to gain a deeper understanding of the thoughts of a comatose patient. Traditionally, brain signals collected by an EEG could only be translated into text, but with the novel method of an open-source model available on GitHub, DreamDiffusion can be used to convert brain waves into images directly. DreamDiffusion works by extracting features from EEG signals and then using the features to create images through StableDiffusion. Upon this, we made further improvements that could make StableDiffusion the forerunner technology in waves to media translation. In our study, we begin by modifying the existing DreamDiffusion codebase so that it does not require any prior setup, avoiding any confusing steps needed to run the model from GitHub. For many researchers, the incomplete setup process, errors in the existing code, and a lack of directions made it nearly impossible to run, not even considering the model's performance. We brought the code into Google Colab so users could run and evaluate problems cell-by-cell, eliminating the specific file and repository dependencies. We also provided the original training data file so users do not need to purchase the necessary computing power to train the model from the given dataset. The second change is utilizing the mutability of the code and optimizing the model so it can be used to generate images from other given inputs, such as sleep data. Additionally, the affordability of EEG technology allows for global dissemination and creates the opportunity for those who want to work on the shared DreamDiffusion model."

However, due to the complexity of ERP signal components, their low signal-to-noise ratio, and significant inter-subject variability, cross-subject ERP signal detection has been challenging. The continuous advancement in deep learning has greatly contributed to addressing this issue. This brief proposes a contrastive learning training framework and an Inception module to extract multi-scale temporal and spatial features, representing the subject-invariant components of ERP signals. Specifically, a base encoder integrated with a linear Inception module and a nonlinear projector is used to project the raw data into latent space. By maximizing signal similarity under different targets, the inter-subject EEG signal differences in latent space are minimized. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used for ERP target detection. The proposed algorithm achieved the best AUC performance in single-trial binary classification tasks on the P300 dataset and showed significant optimization in speller decoding tasks compared to existing algorithms."

      "abstract": "Advanced cognition can be extracted from the human brain using brain-computer interfaces. Integrating these interfaces with computer vision techniques, which possess efficient feature extraction capabilities, can achieve more robust and accurate detection of dim targets in aerial images. However, existing target detection methods primarily concentrate on homogeneous data, lacking efficient and versatile processing capabilities for heterogeneous multimodal data. In this paper, we first build a brain-eye-computer based object detection system for aerial images under few-shot conditions. This system detects suspicious targets using region proposal networks, evokes the event-related potential (ERP) signal in electroencephalogram (EEG) through the eye-tracking-based slow serial visual presentation (ESSVP) paradigm, and constructs the EEG-image data pairs with eye movement data. Then, an adaptive modality balanced online knowledge distillation (AMBOKD) method is proposed to recognize dim objects with the EEG-image data. AMBOKD fuses EEG and image features using a multi-head attention module, establishing a new modality with comprehensive features. To enhance the performance and robust capability of the fusion modality, simultaneous training and mutual learning between modalities are enabled by end-to-end online knowledge distillation. During the learning process, an adaptive modality balancing module is proposed to ensure multimodal equilibrium by dynamically adjusting the weights of the importance and the training gradients across various modalities. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are demonstrated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, experiments conducted on public datasets and system validations in real-world scenarios demonstrate the reliability and practicality of the proposed system and the designed method.",

Accordingly, endeavors have been focused on building EEG-based datasets from visual or textual single-modal stimuli. However, these datasets offer limited EEG epochs per category, and the complex semantics of stimuli presented to participants compromise their quality and fidelity in capturing precise brain activity. The study in neuroscience unveils that the relationship between visual and textual stimulus in EEG recordings provides valuable insights into the brain's ability to process and integrate multi-modal information simultaneously. Inspired by this, we propose a novel large-scale multi-modal dataset, named EIT-1M, with over 1 million EEG-image-text pairs. Our dataset is superior in its capacity of reflecting brain activities in simultaneously processing multi-modal information. To achieve this, we collected data pairs while participants viewed alternating sequences of visual-textual stimuli from 60K natural images and category-specific texts. Common semantic categories are also included to elicit better reactions from participants' brains. Meanwhile, response-based stimulus timing and repetition across blocks and sessions are included to ensure data diversity. To verify the effectiveness of EIT-1M, we provide an in-depth analysis of EEG data captured from multi-modal stimuli across different categories and participants, along with data quality scores for transparency. We demonstrate its validity on two tasks: 1) EEG recognition from visual or textual stimuli or both and 2) EEG-to-visual generation."

Considering many users struggle with effective control of MI-BCI systems, a more user-centered approach to training might help motivate users and facilitate learning, alleviating inefficiency of the BCI system. With the increase of BCI-controlled games, researchers have suggested using game principles for BCI training, as games are naturally centered on the player. This review identifies and evaluates the application of game design elements to MI-BCI training, a process known as gamification. Through a systematic literature search, we examined how MI-BCI training protocols have been gamified and how specific game elements impacted the training outcomes. We identified 86 studies that employed gamified MI-BCI protocols in the past decade. The prevalence and reported effects of individual game elements on user experience and performance were extracted and synthesized. Results reveal that MI-BCI training protocols are most often gamified by having users move an avatar in a virtual environment that provides visual feedback. Furthermore, in these virtual environments, users were provided with goals that guided their actions. Using gamification, the reviewed protocols allowed users to reach effective MI-BCI control, with studies reporting positive effects of four individual elements on user performance and experience, namely: feedback, avatars, assistance, and social interaction. Based on these elements, this review makes current and future recommendations for effective gamification, such as the use of virtual reality and adaptation of game difficulty to user skill level."

EDPNet employs a lightweight adaptive spatial-spectral fusion module, which promotes more efficient information fusion between multiple EEG electrodes. Subsequently, a parameter-free multi-scale variance pooling module extracts more comprehensive temporal features. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototypical learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets.

However, simultaneously recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules, the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems."

The results show that all individual finger flexion and hand gestures are equally decodable across multiple models and subjects (>98.0\\%).

When decoding among multiple hand movements, finger flexion appears to outperform hand gestures (96.2\\% and 92.5\\% respectively) and exhibit greater robustness against misclassification errors when all hand movements are included.

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance."

Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics."

In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure.

However, many models either use graph neural networks (GNN) to construct single-level brain functional networks (BFNs) or employ spatial convolution filtering for local information extraction from rs-fMRI data, often neglecting high-order features crucial for NDD classification. Methods: We introduce a Multi-view High-order Network (MHNet) to capture hierarchical and high-order features from multi-view BFNs derived from rs-fMRI data for NDD prediction. MHNet has two branches: the Euclidean Space Features Extraction (ESFE) module and the Non-Euclidean Space Features Extraction (Non-ESFE) module, followed by a Feature Fusion-based Classification (FFC) module for NDD identification. ESFE includes a Functional Connectivity Generation (FCG) module and a High-order Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) module to extract local and high-order features from BFNs in Euclidean space. Non-ESFE comprises a Generic Internet-like Brain Hierarchical Network Generation (G-IBHN-G) module and a High-order Graph Neural Network (HGNN) module to capture topological and high-order features in non-Euclidean space. Results: Experiments on three public datasets show that MHNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods using both AAL1 and Brainnetome Atlas templates. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of MHNet and the effectiveness of using multi-view fMRI information and high-order features. Our study also offers atlas options for constructing more sophisticated hierarchical networks and explains the association between key brain regions and NDD.

Our results show excellent task-specificity of canonical networks, i.e., the expression of a small number of canonical networks can be used to accurately predict tasks; generalizability across cohorts, i.e., canonical networks are conserved across diverse populations, studies, and acquisition protocols; and that canonical networks have strong anatomical and physiological basis. From a methods perspective, the problem of identifying these canonical networks poses challenges rooted in the high dimensionality, small sample size, acquisition variability, and noise.

Understanding those dynamic changes and the neuronal networks involved is critical for understanding how the brain functions in health and disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a prevalent neuroimaging technique for studying these complex interactions. However, analyzing fMRI data poses several challenges. Furthermore, most approaches for analyzing Functional Connectivity (FC) still rely on preprocessing or conventional methods, often built upon oversimplified assumptions. On top of that, those approaches often ignore frequency-related information despite evidence showing that fMRI data contain rich information that spans multiple timescales. This study introduces a novel methodology, Multiscale Functional Connectivity (MFC), to analyze fMRI data by decomposing the fMRI into their intrinsic modes, allowing us to separate the neurophysiological activation patterns at multiple timescales while separating them from other interfering components. Additionally, the proposed approach accounts for the natural nonlinear and nonstationary nature of fMRI and the particularities of each individual in a data-driven way. We evaluated the performance of our proposed methodology using three fMRI experiments. Our results demonstrate that our novel approach effectively separates the fMRI data into different timescales while identifying highly reliable functional connectivity patterns across individuals. In addition, we further extended our knowledge of how the FC for these three experiments spans among different timescales."

Another practice that goes unchallenged is thresholding weighted FCs to remove spurious connections without justifying the chosen threshold. This paper leverages recent theoretical advances in Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) to formally define and quantify the information-theoretic fitness (e.g., prominence) of a predetermined set of FNs when mapped to individual FCs under different fMRI task conditions. Our framework allows for evaluating any combination of FC granularity, FN partition, and thresholding strategy, thereby optimizing these choices to preserve important topological features of the human brain connectomes. Our results pave the way for the proper use of predetermined FNs and thresholding methods and provide insights for future research in individualized parcellations."

Our method creates a universal channel alignment by using brain voxel fMRI response prediction as the training objective. We discover that deep networks, trained with different objectives, share common feature channels across various models. These channels can be clustered into recurring sets, corresponding to distinct brain regions, indicating the formation of visual concepts. Tracing the clusters of channel responses onto the images, we see semantically meaningful object segments emerge, even without any supervised decoder. Furthermore, the universal feature alignment and the clustering of channels produce a picture and quantification of how visual information is processed through the different network layers, which produces precise comparisons between the networks."

      "abstract": "The human brain is a complex, dynamic network, which is commonly studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and modeled as network of Regions of interest (ROIs) for understanding various brain functions. Recent studies utilize deep learning approaches to learn the brain network representation based on functional connectivity (FC) profile, broadly falling into two main categories. The Fixed-FC approaches, utilizing the FC profile which represents the linear temporal relation within the brain network, are limited by failing to capture informative brain temporal dynamics. On the other hand, the Dynamic-FC approaches, modeling the evolving FC profile over time, often exhibit less satisfactory performance due to challenges in handling the inherent noisy nature of fMRI data.   To address these challenges, we propose Brain Masked Auto-Encoder (BrainMAE) for learning representations directly from fMRI time-series data. Our approach incorporates two essential components: a region-aware graph attention mechanism designed to capture the relationships between different brain ROIs, and a novel self-supervised masked autoencoding framework for effective model pre-training. These components enable the model to capture rich temporal dynamics of brain activity while maintaining resilience to inherent noise in fMRI data. Our experiments demonstrate that BrainMAE consistently outperforms established baseline methods by significant margins in four distinct downstream tasks. Finally, leveraging the model's inherent interpretability, our analysis of model-generated representations reveals findings that resonate with ongoing research in the field of neuroscience."

This project proposes the use of matrix operations by combining mixed noise elimination methods with wavelet analysis to replace traditional iterative algorithms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory cortex of a single subject is analyzed and compared to the wavelet domain signal processing technology based on repeated times and the world's most influential SPM8. Experiments show that this algorithm is the fastest in computing time, and its detection effect is comparable to the traditional iterative algorithm.

This study investigates whether music can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI) during its perception. Leveraging recent advancements in extensive datasets and pre-trained computational models, we construct mappings between neural data and latent representations of musical stimuli. Our approach integrates functional and anatomical alignment techniques to facilitate cross-subject decoding, addressing the challenges posed by the low temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI data. Starting from the GTZan fMRI dataset, where five participants listened to 540 musical stimuli from 10 different genres while their brain activity was recorded, we used the CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) model to extract latent representations of the musical stimuli and developed voxel-wise encoding models to identify brain regions responsive to these stimuli. By applying a threshold to the association between predicted and actual brain activity, we identified specific regions of interest (ROIs) which can be interpreted as key players in music processing. Our decoding pipeline, primarily retrieval-based, employs a linear map to project brain activity to the corresponding CLAP features. This enables us to predict and retrieve the musical stimuli most similar to those that originated the fMRI data. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art identification accuracy, with our methods significantly outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that neural-based music retrieval systems could enable personalized recommendations and therapeutic applications. Future work could use higher temporal resolution neuroimaging and generative models to improve decoding accuracy and explore the neural underpinnings of music perception and emotion.",

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning."

Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified."

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%.

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric.

While this approach can be useful in some experimental designs, it presents significant limitations for certain types of analyses, such as identifying the category of an object observed by a subject. In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels. We do this using two datasets; the Kaneshiro et al. (2015) dataset and the Gifford et al. (2022) dataset. Our results raise doubts about the true generalizability of several published models and suggests that the reported performance of these models may be significantly inflated."

Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the \"foundation\" layer, our framework proposes the \"subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the \"surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate \"subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer."

Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group."

In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment.",

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

As each area is prominent within its respective field, more firmly connecting these areas could prove useful in the dialogue between neuroscience and machine learning. After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

      "abstract": "Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

Thereby, antibody-based data often needs to be seen with caution. Here, we present a simple-to-use approach to characterize and quantify antibody binding properties directly in the system of choice. We determine an epitope accessibility distribution in the system of interest based on a computational analysis of antibody-dilution immunofluorescence stainings. This allows the selection of specific antibodies, the choice of a dilution to maximize signal-specificity, and an improvement of signal quantification. It further expands the scope of antibody-based imaging to detect changes of the subcellular nano-environment and allows for antibody multiplexing."

Built on the Minerva model and continually pretrained on a diverse corpus of Italian medical texts, Igea is available in three model sizes: 350 million, 1 billion, and 3 billion parameters. The models aim to balance computational efficiency and performance, addressing the challenges of managing the peculiarities of medical terminology in Italian. We evaluate Igea using a mix of in-domain biomedical corpora and general-purpose benchmarks, highlighting its efficacy and retention of general knowledge even after the domain-specific training.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a self-prior guided Mamba-UNet network (SMamba-UNet) for medical image super-resolution. Existing methods are primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers. CNNs-based methods fail to capture long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based approaches face heavy calculation challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) especially Mamba have emerged, capable of modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. Inspired by Mamba, our approach aims to learn the self-prior multi-scale contextual features under Mamba-UNet networks, which may help to super-resolve low-resolution medical images in an efficient way. Specifically, we obtain self-priors by perturbing the brightness inpainting of the input image during network training, which can learn detailed texture and brightness information that is beneficial for super-resolution. Furthermore, we combine Mamba with Unet network to mine global features at different levels. We also design an improved 2D-Selective-Scan (ISS2D) module to divide image features into different directional sequences to learn long-range dependencies in multiple directions, and adaptively fuse sequence information to enhance super-resolved feature representation. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on two public medical datasets: the IXI and fastMRI."

      "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of ovarian tumors from medical images is crucial for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. However, the diverse morphological characteristics and heterogeneous appearances of ovarian tumors pose significant challenges to automated segmentation methods. In this paper, we propose MBA-Net, a novel architecture that integrates the powerful segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with domain-specific knowledge for accurate and robust ovarian tumor segmentation. MBA-Net employs a hybrid encoder architecture, where the encoder consists of a prior branch, which inherits the SAM encoder to capture robust segmentation priors, and a domain branch, specifically designed to extract domain-specific features. The bidirectional flow of information between the two branches is facilitated by the robust feature injection network (RFIN) and the domain knowledge integration network (DKIN), enabling MBA-Net to leverage the complementary strengths of both branches. We extensively evaluate MBA-Net on the public multi-modality ovarian tumor ultrasound dataset and the in-house multi-site ovarian tumor MRI dataset. Our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation approaches. Moreover, MBA-Net demonstrates superior generalization capability across different imaging modalities and clinical sites."

      "abstract": "The robustness of supervised deep learning-based medical image classification is significantly undermined by label noise. Although several methods have been proposed to enhance classification performance in the presence of noisy labels, they face some challenges: 1) a struggle with class-imbalanced datasets, leading to the frequent overlooking of minority classes as noisy samples; 2) a singular focus on maximizing performance using noisy datasets, without incorporating experts-in-the-loop for actively cleaning the noisy labels. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a two-phase approach that combines Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) and active learning. This approach not only improves the robustness of medical image classification in the presence of noisy labels, but also iteratively improves the quality of the dataset by relabeling the important incorrect labels, under a limited annotation budget. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Variance of Gradients approach in LNL phase, which complements the loss-based sample selection by also sampling under-represented samples. Using two imbalanced noisy medical classification datasets, we demonstrate that that our proposed technique is superior to its predecessors at handling class imbalance by not misidentifying clean samples from minority classes as mostly noisy samples."

In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation model that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology Exchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which decodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and interleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for anatomy-informed pathology predictions. In doing so, we are able to report the best results across the board on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-Ray pathology segmentation tasks with a margin of up to 3.3% as compared to strong baseline methods.

However, its inherent bias against specific groups hinders its clinical applicability in equitable healthcare systems. A recently discovered phenomenon, Neural Collapse (NC), has shown potential in improving the generalization of state-of-the-art deep learning models. Nonetheless, its implications on bias in medical imaging remain unexplored. Our study investigates deep learning fairness through the lens of NC. We analyze the training dynamics of models as they approach NC when training using biased datasets, and examine the subsequent impact on test performance, specifically focusing on label bias. We find that biased training initially results in different NC configurations across subgroups, before converging to a final NC solution by memorizing all data samples. Through extensive experiments on three medical imaging datasets -- PAPILA, HAM10000, and CheXpert -- we find that in biased settings, NC can lead to a significant drop in F1 score across all subgroups.

A primary hurdle in FL arises from the non-IID nature of data samples across clients, which typically results in a decline in the performance of the aggregated global model. In this study, we introduce FedMRL, a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework designed to address data heterogeneity. FedMRL incorporates a novel loss function to facilitate fairness among clients, preventing bias in the final global model. Additionally, it employs a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to calculate the proximal term $(\\mu)$ for the personalized local objective function, ensuring convergence to the global optimum. Furthermore, FedMRL integrates an adaptive weight adjustment method using a Self-organizing map (SOM) on the server side to counteract distribution shifts among clients' local data distributions. We assess our approach using two publicly available real-world medical datasets, and the results demonstrate that FedMRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, showing its efficacy in addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning.
