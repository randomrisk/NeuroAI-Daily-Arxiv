      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) are a pressing global public health issue, impacting tens of millions of individuals annually. Vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians, are vastly overrepresented in the worldwide TBI statistics. To evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention measures, researchers often employ Finite Element (FE) models of the human body to virtually simulate the human response to impact in real-world road traffic accident scenarios. However, VRU accidents occur in a highly uncontrolled environment and, in consequence, there is a large amount of variables (covariates), e.g. the vehicle impact speed and VRU body posture, that together dictate the injurious outcome of the collision. At the same time, since FE analysis is a computationally heavy task, researchers often need to apply extensive simplifications to FE models when attempting to predict real-world VRU head trauma. To help researchers make informed decisions when conducting FE accident reconstructions, this literature review aims to create an overarching summary of covariates that have been reported influential in literature. The review provides researchers with an overview of variables proven to have an influence on head injury predictions. The material could potentially be useful as a basis for choosing parameters to include when performing sensitivity analyses of car-to-pedestrian impact simulations."

      "abstract": "Accurate and reproducible brain morphometry from structural MRI is critical for monitoring neuroanatomical changes across time and across imaging domains. Although deep learning has accelerated segmentation workflows, scanner-induced variability and reproducibility limitations remain-especially in longitudinal and multi-site settings. In this study, we benchmark two modern segmentation pipelines, FastSurfer and SynthSeg, both integrated into FreeSurfer, one of the most widely adopted tools in neuroimaging.   Using two complementary datasets - a 17-year longitudinal cohort (SIMON) and a 9-site test-retest cohort (SRPBS)-we quantify inter-scan segmentation variability using Dice coefficient, Surface Dice, Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our results reveal up to 7-8% volume variation in small subcortical structures such as the amygdala and ventral diencephalon, even under controlled test-retest conditions. This raises a key question: is it feasible to detect subtle longitudinal changes on the order of 5-10% in pea-sized brain regions, given the magnitude of domain-induced morphometric noise?   We further analyze the effects of registration templates and interpolation modes, and propose surface-based quality filtering to improve segmentation reliability. This study provides a reproducible benchmark for morphometric reproducibility and emphasizes the need for harmonization strategies in real-world neuroimaging studies.

Data from the ABIDE-II repository and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) metrics are used to form two ASD groups with tightly controlled demographics; one comprises subjects with scores above threshold for the self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) subscale, and the other subjects with scores below threshold for SIBs, but above threshold for at least one of the other subscales (stereotyped, compulsive, ritualistic, insistence on sameness, restricted interests). The dynamics of the coherence for FCs across distinct frequency bands are compared against matched controls, using a novel volatility measure computed in time-frequency space. We find statistically significant differences, on average, in the volatility of a relatively small set of FCs, most mapping to either the default mode network or the cerebellum, in the mid- and high-frequency bands, and yielding higher volatility in subjects with high levels of SIBs. Results suggest a distinct underlying profile for SIBs involving multiple brain regions associated with rewards and emotions processing. The work contributes to the identification of neural substrates potentially underlying behavioral subtypes, and may help target interventions."

This work shows the challenges for real-time 2D UHDR dosimetry, and aims to present a solution in the context of preclinical irradiations in non-homogeneous UHDR electron beams. An experimental camera-scintillation sheet combination, was used to investigate the spatial dose distribution of a converted UHDR Varian Trilogy. The dosimetric system was characterized by variation of the number of pulses and source to surface distance (SSD) and its application was investigated by variation of bolus thickness and ambient light intensity. The challenges of prelcinical real time 2D dosimetry with scintillating coatings were assessed by ex vivo irradiations of a rat brain, mouse hindlimb and whole body mouse. Radiochromic EBT XD film was used as passive reference dosimeter. The coating showed a linear response with the number of pulses in the absence and presence of transparent bolus, up to 3 cm thick, and with the inverse squared SSD. The presence of ambient light reduces the signal-background ratio. The sheet showed to have sufficient flexibility to be molded on the subjects' surface, following its curvatures. Linearity with number of pulses was preserved in a preclinical setting. For small field sizes the light output became too low, resulting in noisy dose maps. The system showed robust within 5% for camera set up differences. Calibration of the system was complicated due to set up variations and the inhomogeneity of the beam. We showed the need for 2D real-time dosimetry to determine beam characteristics in non-homogeneous UHDR beams using a preclinical setting. We presented one solution to meet this need with scintillating based dosimetry."

Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it comes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions."

These so-called \\textit{Double Wishart problems} arise in contexts such as MANOVA, covariance matrix equality testing, and hypothesis testing in multivariate linear regression. A prominent classical approach, Roy's largest root test, relies on the largest eigenvalue of \\(\\bF\\) for inference. However, in high-dimensional settings, this test becomes impractical due to the singularity or near-singularity of \\(\\bW_2\\). To address this challenge, we propose a ridge-regularization framework by introducing a ridge term to \\(\\bW_2\\). Specifically, we develop a family of ridge-regularized largest root tests, leveraging the largest eigenvalue of \\(\\bF_\\lambda = \\bW_1(\\bW_2 + \\lambda I)^{-1}\\), where \\(\\lambda > 0\\) is the regularization parameter. Under mild assumptions, we establish the asymptotic Tracy-Widom distribution of the largest eigenvalue of \\(\\bF_\\lambda\\) after appropriate scaling. An efficient method for estimating the scaling parameters is proposed using the Mar\\v{c}enko-Pastur equation, and the consistency of these estimators is proven. The proposed framework is applied to illustrative Double Wishart problems, and simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the numerical performance of the methods. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the \\emph{Human Connectome Project} data to test for the presence of associations between volumetric measurements of human brain and behavioral variables."

ML applications extensively use floating-point computation and involve very large/small numbers; thus, maintaining the numerical stability of such complex computations remains an important challenge. Numerical bugs can lead to system crashes, incorrect output, and wasted computing resources. In this paper, we introduce a novel idea, namely soft assertions (SA), to encode safety/error conditions for the places where numerical instability can occur. A soft assertion is an ML model automatically trained using the dataset obtained during unit testing of unstable functions. Given the values at the unstable function in an ML application, a soft assertion reports how to change these values in order to trigger the instability. We then use the output of soft assertions as signals to effectively mutate inputs to trigger numerical instability in ML applications. In the evaluation, we used the GRIST benchmark, a total of 79 programs, as well as 15 real-world ML applications from GitHub. We compared our tool with 5 state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers. We found all the GRIST bugs and outperformed the baselines. We found 13 numerical bugs in real-world code, one of which had already been confirmed by the GitHub developers. While the baselines mostly found the bugs that report NaN and INF, our tool \\tool found numerical bugs with incorrect output. We showed one case where the Tumor Detection Model, trained on Brain MRI images, should have predicted \"tumor\", but instead, it incorrectly predicted \"no tumor\" due to the numerical bugs.

To generate input data for our approach, an experiment with full-field measurement has to be conducted to gather testing force and corresponding displacement field of the sample. Then, in the first step of the dual-stage framework, a new finite strain Data-Driven Identification (DDI) formulation is applied. This method enables to identify tuples consisting of stresses and strains by only prescribing the applied boundary conditions and the measured displacement field. In the second step, the data set is used to calibrate a Physics-Augmented Neural Network (PANN), which fulfills all common conditions of hyperelasticity by construction and is very flexible at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by several descriptive examples. Two-dimensional synthetic data are exemplarily generated in virtual experiments by using a reference constitutive model. The calibrated PANN is then applied in 3D Finite Element simulations. In addition, a real experiment including noisy data is mimicked."

We evaluate our approach using perceptual similarity, pixel-level agreement, and distributional consistency metrics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing anatomical structures and preserving information on white matter integrity. The practical utility of the synthetic data is validated through sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification tasks, where the generated images achieve comparable performance to real data.

Traditional methods rely on long-duration data recording followed by offline analysis, which is power-intensive and delays responses to critical symptoms such as arrhythmia. To overcome these limitations, a time-domain ECG analysis model based on a novel dynamically-biased Long Short-Term Memory (DB-LSTM) neural network is proposed. This model supports simultaneous ECG forecasting and classification with high performance-achieving over 98% accuracy and a normalized mean square error below 1e-3 for forecasting, and over 97% accuracy with faster convergence and fewer training parameters for classification. To enable edge deployment, the model is hardware-optimized by quantizing weights to INT4 or INT3 formats, resulting in only a 2% and 6% drop in classification accuracy during training and inference, respectively, while maintaining full accuracy for forecasting. Extensive simulations using multiple ECG datasets confirm the model's robustness. Future work includes implementing the algorithm on FPGA and CMOS circuits for practical cardiac monitoring, as well as developing a digital hardware platform that supports flexible neural network configurations and on-chip online training for personalized healthcare applications."

Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates.

Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects.

We present a neuroadaptive haptics system that adapts XR feedback through reinforcement learning (RL) from explicit user ratings and brain-decoded neural signals. In a user study, participants interacted with virtual objects in VR while Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. An RL agent adjusted haptic feedback based either on explicit ratings or on outputs from a neural decoder.

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%."

However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches."

However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation.

It integrates gradients along the input path to globally infer the causal relationships between input channels and outputs, and ranks the contribution sequences to identify the most highly attributed channels. The results showed that for three BCI paradigms, i.e., auditory attention decoding (AAD), motor imagery (MI), affective computation (AC), PlugSelect could reduce the number of channels by at least half while effectively maintaining decoding performance and improving efficiency.

EEG is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data."

Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures.\" We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods."

However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively."

These factors contribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in turn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning network (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a representation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly (NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC). This mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical directions, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize the feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module that can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior information. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of balancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression tasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy of 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces site variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain regions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering the \"black box\" of deep learning to a certain extent."

Additionally, images and text are aligned separately with fMRI without considering the complex interplay between images and text, leading to poor image reconstruction. Finally, the enormous dimensionality of CLIP embeddings causes significant computational costs. Although the dimensionality of CLIP embeddings can be reduced by ignoring the number of patches obtained from images and the number of tokens acquired from text, this comes at the cost of a significant drop in model performance, creating a dilemma.

      "abstract": "In modern society, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the common mental diseases discovered not only in children but also in adults. In this context, we propose a ADHD diagnosis transformer model that can effectively simultaneously find important brain spatiotemporal biomarkers from resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI). This model not only learns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with full attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it focuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and distinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically, the three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows. First, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive embedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the previously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for individual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to local temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features of fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal features with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI, ROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI relationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types of transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939 individuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this, the spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the performance of other different types of transformer variants. (77.78ACC 76.60SPE 79.22SEN 79.30AUC)"

The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\\tau\\to \\mu\\gamma$, $\\tau\\to e\\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$."

We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis.

However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume.

For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts.

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

      "abstract": "Imaging the human body's morphological and angiographic information is essential for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. Ultrasonography performs the morphological assessment of the soft tissue based on acoustic impedance variations, whereas photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can visualize blood vessels based on intrinsic hemoglobin absorption. Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV) probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously. The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast, hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution, and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for rapid clinical translation."

      "abstract": "PET requires accurate, precise, and efficient scatter correction techniques. Conventional scatter estimation typically relies on tail-fitted single-scatter simulation (SSS) strategy. However, the accuracy of tail-fitted SSS is limited, for example, by mismatches between the attenuation image and the PET emission data or by the presence of activity outside the FOV. These shortcomings can be addressed using energy-based scatter estimation (EBSE), as recently proposed by Efthimiou et al. and Hamill et al. The aim of this work is to 1. improve the accuracy of EBSE by accounting for the LOR dependence of the energy spectrum of unscattered photons, 2. improve the computational speed of EBSE through better initialization and a more efficient optimization algorithm. The proposed improved EBSE method models the energy probability density function (PDF) of both single and multiple scattered photons, and incorporates a position-dependent energy PDF for unscattered photons. These energy PDFs form the basis of two forward models used for scatter estimation based on 2D energy histograms. The performance of these models were evaluated using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and a NEMA phantom acquisition on a GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner. Furthermore, we assessed the stability of EBSE across the forward models by varying the number of counts in the 2D energy histograms via data mashing. EBSE outperformed tail-fitted SSS, particularly in regions near out-of-FOV activity. Our GATE simulations showed that incorporating a local energy for unscattered photons improves off-center regional quantification by approximately 2% points. Additionally, improved initialization combined with the NEGML optimizer enabling execution on a mashed TOF sinogram in 12 minutes on six-core CPU. The proposed method enhances both the accuracy and computational efficiency of EBSE, making it well-suited for clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Diagnostic imaging relies on interpreting both images and radiology reports, but the growing data volumes place significant pressure on medical experts, yielding increased errors and workflow backlogs. Medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art alignment methods."

We introduce GlobeReady, a clinician-friendly AI platform that enables ocular disease diagnosis without retraining/fine-tuning or technical expertise. GlobeReady achieves high accuracy across imaging modalities: 93.9-98.5% for an 11-category fundus photo dataset and 87.2-92.7% for a 15-category OCT dataset. Through training-free local feature augmentation, it addresses domain shifts across centers and populations, reaching an average accuracy of 88.9% across five centers in China, 86.3% in Vietnam, and 90.2% in the UK. The built-in confidence-quantifiable diagnostic approach further boosted accuracy to 94.9-99.4% (fundus) and 88.2-96.2% (OCT), while identifying out-of-distribution cases at 86.3% (49 CFP categories) and 90.6% (13 OCT categories). Clinicians from multiple countries rated GlobeReady highly (average 4.6 out of 5) for its usability and clinical relevance. These results demonstrate GlobeReady's robust, scalable diagnostic capability and potential to support ophthalmic care without technical barriers."

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a serious ocular complication that poses a significant threat to patients' vision and overall health. Early detection and accurate grading are essential to prevent vision loss. Current automatic grading methods rely heavily on deep learning applied to retinal fundus images, but the complex, irregular patterns of lesions in these images, which vary in shape and distribution, make it difficult to capture subtle changes. This study introduces RadFuse, a multi-representation deep learning framework that integrates non-linear RadEx-transformed sinogram images with traditional fundus images to enhance diabetic retinopathy detection and grading. Our RadEx transformation, an optimized non-linear extension of the Radon transform, generates sinogram representations to capture complex retinal lesion patterns. By leveraging both spatial and transformed domain information, RadFuse enriches the feature set available to deep learning models, improving the differentiation of severity levels. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, APTOS-2019 and DDR, using three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNeXt-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG19. RadFuse showed significant improvements over fundus-image-only models across all three CNN architectures and outperformed state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. For severity grading across five stages, RadFuse achieved a quadratic weighted kappa of 93.24%, an accuracy of 87.07%, and an F1-score of 87.17%. In binary classification between healthy and diabetic retinopathy cases, the method reached an accuracy of 99.09%, precision of 98.58%, and recall of 99.6%, surpassing previously established models. These results demonstrate RadFuse's capacity to capture complex non-linear features, advancing diabetic retinopathy classification and promoting the integration of advanced mathematical transforms in medical image analysis."

      "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable progress in the field of medical imaging. However, adapting DL models to medical tasks remains a significant challenge, primarily due to two key factors: (1) architecture selection, as different tasks necessitate specialized model designs, and (2) weight initialization, which directly impacts the convergence speed and final performance of the models. Although transfer learning from ImageNet is a widely adopted strategy, its effectiveness is constrained by the substantial differences between natural and medical images. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Neural Network Search (MedNNS), the first Neural Network Search framework for medical imaging applications. MedNNS jointly optimizes architecture selection and weight initialization by constructing a meta-space that encodes datasets and models based on how well they perform together. We build this space using a Supernetwork-based approach, expanding the model zoo size by 51x times over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, we introduce rank loss and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) loss into the construction of the space to capture inter-model and inter-dataset relationships, thereby achieving more accurate alignment in the meta-space. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that MedNNS significantly outperforms both ImageNet pre-trained DL models and SOTA Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1.7% across datasets while converging substantially faster. The code and the processed meta-space is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MedNNS."

Dosimetry hereof remains challenging with several crucial aspects missing. This work shows the challenges for real-time 2D UHDR dosimetry, and aims to present a solution in the context of preclinical irradiations in non-homogeneous UHDR electron beams. An experimental camera-scintillation sheet combination, was used to investigate the spatial dose distribution of a converted UHDR Varian Trilogy. The dosimetric system was characterized by variation of the number of pulses and source to surface distance (SSD) and its application was investigated by variation of bolus thickness and ambient light intensity. The challenges of prelcinical real time 2D dosimetry with scintillating coatings were assessed by ex vivo irradiations of a rat brain, mouse hindlimb and whole body mouse. Radiochromic EBT XD film was used as passive reference dosimeter. The coating showed a linear response with the number of pulses in the absence and presence of transparent bolus, up to 3 cm thick, and with the inverse squared SSD. The presence of ambient light reduces the signal-background ratio. The sheet showed to have sufficient flexibility to be molded on the subjects' surface, following its curvatures. Linearity with number of pulses was preserved in a preclinical setting. For small field sizes the light output became too low, resulting in noisy dose maps. The system showed robust within 5% for camera set up differences. Calibration of the system was complicated due to set up variations and the inhomogeneity of the beam. We showed the need for 2D real-time dosimetry to determine beam characteristics in non-homogeneous UHDR beams using a preclinical setting. We presented one solution to meet this need with scintillating based dosimetry."

In this work, we studied the prediction of age from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images, which provide detailed representations of the heart morphology, with the goals of (i) studying the relationship between morphology and aging, and (ii) developing a novel \\emph{morphological heart age} biomarker. We applied an image registration-based method that standardizes the images from the whole cohort into a single space. We then extracted supervoxels (using unsupervised segmentation), and corresponding robust features of density and local volume, which provide a detailed representation of the heart morphology while being robust to registration errors. Machine learning models are then trained to fit regression models from these features to the chronological age. We applied the method to a subset of the images from the Swedish CArdioPulomonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) dataset, consisting of 721 females and 666 males. We observe a mean absolute error of $2.74$ years for females and $2.77$ years for males. The predictions from different sub-regions of interest were observed to be more highly correlated with the predictions from the whole heart, compared to the chronological age, revealing a high consistency in the predictions from morphology. Saliency analysis was also performed on the prediction models to study what regions are associated positively and negatively with the predicted age. This resulted in detailed association maps where the density and volume of known, as well as some novel sub-regions of interest, are determined to be important. The saliency analysis aids in the interpretability of the models and their predictions."

      "abstract": "The performance of medical image segmentation models is usually evaluated using metrics like the Dice score and Hausdorff distance, which compare predicted masks to ground truth annotations. However, when applying the model to unseen data, such as in clinical settings, it is often impractical to annotate all the data, making the model's performance uncertain. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation Performance Evaluator (SPE), a framework for estimating segmentation models' performance on unlabeled data. This framework is adaptable to various evaluation metrics and model architectures. Experiments on six publicly available datasets across six evaluation metrics including pixel-based metrics such as Dice score and distance-based metrics like HD95, demonstrated the versatility and effectiveness of our approach, achieving a high correlation (0.956$\\pm$0.046) and low MAE (0.025$\\pm$0.019) compare with real Dice score on the independent test set. These results highlight its ability to reliably estimate model performance without requiring annotations. The SPE framework integrates seamlessly into any model training process without adding training overhead, enabling performance estimation and facilitating the real-world application of medical image segmentation algorithms.

This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions."
