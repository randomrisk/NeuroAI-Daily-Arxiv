      "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is pivotal for probing the microstructure of the rapidly-developing fetal brain. However, fetal motion during scans and its interaction with magnetic field inhomogeneities result in artifacts and data scattering across spatial and angular domains. The effects of those artifacts are more pronounced in high-angular resolution fetal dMRI, where signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Those effects lead to biased estimates and compromise the consistency and reliability of dMRI analysis. This work presents HAITCH, the first and the only publicly available tool to correct and reconstruct multi-shell high-angular resolution fetal dMRI data. HAITCH offers several technical advances that include a blip-reversed dual-echo acquisition for dynamic distortion correction, advanced motion correction for model-free and robust reconstruction, optimized multi-shell design for enhanced information capture and increased tolerance to motion, and outlier detection for improved reconstruction fidelity. The framework is open-source, flexible, and can be used to process any type of fetal dMRI data including single-echo or single-shell acquisitions, but is most effective when used with multi-shell multi-echo fetal dMRI data that cannot be processed with any of the existing tools. Validation experiments on real fetal dMRI scans demonstrate significant improvements and accurate correction across diverse fetal ages and motion levels. HAITCH successfully removes artifacts and reconstructs high-fidelity fetal dMRI data suitable for advanced diffusion modeling, including fiber orientation distribution function estimation. These advancements pave the way for more reliable analysis of the fetal brain microstructure and tractography under challenging imaging conditions."

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of conventional SyN ANTs and learning-based registration methods in the context of pediatric neuroimaging, specifically focusing on intrasubject deformable registration. The comparison involves three approaches: without (NR), with rigid (RR), and with rigid and affine (RAR) initializations. In addition to initialization, performances are evaluated in terms of accuracy, speed, and the impact of age intervals and sex per pair. Data consists of the publicly available MRI scans from the Calgary Preschool dataset, which includes 63 children aged 2-7 years, allowing for 431 registration pairs. We implemented the unsupervised DL framework with a U-Net architecture using DeepReg and it was 5-fold cross-validated. Evaluation includes Dice scores for tissue segmentation from 18 smaller regions obtained by SynthSeg, analysis of log Jacobian determinants, and registration pro-rated training and inference times. Learning-based approaches, with or without linear initializations, exhibit slight superiority over SyN ANTs in terms of Dice scores. Indeed, DL-based implementations with RR and RAR initializations significantly outperform SyN ANTs. Both SyN ANTs and DL-based registration involve parameter optimization, but the choice between these methods depends on the scale of registration: network-based for broader coverage or SyN ANTs for specific structures. Both methods face challenges with larger age intervals due to greater growth changes. The main takeaway is that while DL-based methods show promise with faster and more accurate registrations, SyN ANTs remains robust and generalizable without the need for extensive training, highlighting the importance of method selection based on specific registration needs in the pediatric context.

The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their exceptional abilities in solving complex mathematical problems, mastering commonsense and abstract reasoning. This has led to the recent utilization of MLLMs as the brain in robotic systems, enabling these models to conduct high-level planning prior to triggering low-level control actions for task execution. However, it remains uncertain whether existing MLLMs are reliable in serving the brain role of robots. In this study, we introduce the first benchmark for evaluating Multimodal LLM for Robotic (MMRo) benchmark, which tests the capability of MLLMs for robot applications. Specifically, we identify four essential capabilities perception, task planning, visual reasoning, and safety measurement that MLLMs must possess to qualify as the robot's central processing unit. We have developed several scenarios for each capability, resulting in a total of 14 metrics for evaluation. We present experimental results for various MLLMs, including both commercial and open-source models, to assess the performance of existing systems. Our findings indicate that no single model excels in all areas, suggesting that current MLLMs are not yet trustworthy enough to serve as the cognitive core for robots.

Traditional diagnostic approaches are extremely time-consuming and prone to errors. In this context, computer vision-based approaches have emerged as an effective tool for accurate brain tumor classification. While some of the existing solutions demonstrate noteworthy accuracy, the models become infeasible to deploy in areas where computational resources are limited. This research addresses the need for accurate and fast classification of brain tumors with a priority of deploying the model in technologically underdeveloped regions. The research presents a novel architecture for precise brain tumor classification fusing pretrained ResNet152V2 and modified VGG16 models. The proposed architecture undergoes a diligent fine-tuning process that ensures fine gradients are preserved in deep neural networks, which are essential for effective brain tumor classification. The proposed solution incorporates various image processing techniques to improve image quality and achieves an astounding accuracy of 98.36% and 98.04% in Figshare and Kaggle datasets respectively. This architecture stands out for having a streamlined profile, with only 2.8 million trainable parameters. We have leveraged 8-bit quantization to produce a model of size 73.881 MB, significantly reducing it from the previous size of 289.45 MB, ensuring smooth deployment in edge devices even in resource-constrained areas.

However, introducing surrogate gradients has caused SNNs to lose their original sparsity, thus leading to the potential performance loss. In this paper, we first analyze the current problem of direct training using SGs and then propose Masked Surrogate Gradients (MSGs) to balance the effectiveness of training and the sparseness of the gradient, thereby improving the generalization ability of SNNs. Moreover, we introduce a temporally weighted output (TWO) method to decode the network output, reinforcing the importance of correct timesteps.

In contrast, automated sleep staging technology not only directly assesses sleep quality but also helps sleep specialists analyze sleep status, significantly improving efficiency and reducing the cost of sleep monitoring, especially for continuous sleep monitoring. Most of the existing models, however, are deficient in computational efficiency, lightweight design, and model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture based on the prior knowledge of sleep experts.

A novel residual multi-view pyramid GCN module (RMPG) is then proposed to learn dynamic graph representations for each EEG feature graph within the series, and the learned representations of each graph are fused into one token. Furthermore, we design a temporal contextual transformer module (TCT) with two types of token mixers to learn the temporal contextual information. Finally, the task-specific output module (TSO) generates the desired outputs.

Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological diseases worldwide, affects approximately the 1 \\% of the population. These patients face significant risks, underscoring the need for reliable, continuous seizure monitoring in daily life. Most of the techniques discussed in the literature rely on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, the challenge of accurately labeling variations in epileptic EEG waveforms complicates the use of these approaches. Additionally, the rarity of ictal events introduces an high imbalancing within the data, which could lead to poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. Instead, a semi-supervised approach allows to train the model only on data not containing seizures, thus avoiding the issues related to the data imbalancing. This work proposes a semi-supervised approach for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data, utilizing a novel Deep Learning-based method called SincVAE. This proposal incorporates the learning of an ad-hoc array of bandpass filter as a first layer of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), potentially eliminating the preprocessing stage where informative band frequencies are identified and isolated. Results indicate that SincVAE improves seizure detection in EEG data and is capable of identifying early seizures during the preictal stage as well as monitoring patients throughout the postictal stage."

Estimating significant causal relationships between motor cortex electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG) from concurrently active muscles presents a formidable challenge since the relevant processes underlying muscle control are typically weak in comparison to measurement noise and background activities. Methodology: In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to simultaneously estimate the order of the autoregressive model of cortico-muscular interactions along with the parameters while enforcing stationarity condition in a convex program to ensure global optimality. The proposed method is further extended to a non-convex program to account for the presence of measurement noise in the recorded signals by introducing a wavelet sparsity assumption on the excitation noise in the model. Results: The proposed methodology is validated using both simulated data and neurophysiological signals. In case of simulated data, the performance of the proposed methods has been compared with the benchmark approaches in terms of order identification, computational efficiency, and goodness of fit in relation to various noise levels. In case of physiological signals our proposed methods are compared against the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the ability to detect Granger causality. Significance: The proposed methods are shown to be effective in handling stationarity and measurement noise assumptions, revealing significant causal interactions from brain to muscles and vice versa."

First, fNIRS and EEG are transformed into different but correlated data based on a time-domain data augmentation strategy. Then, we design a spatio-temporal contrasting module to learn the representation of fNIRS and EEG through weight-sharing multiscale spatio-temporal convolution. Furthermore, to enhance the learning of semantic representation associated with stimulation tasks, a semantic consistency contrast module is proposed, aiming to maximize the semantic similarity of fNIRS and EEG. Extensive experiments on publicly available and self-collected multimodal physiological signals datasets indicate that MRLMC outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

However a cognitive assessment is nowadays still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on objective neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is in fact readily observable and readable.   Objective: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms discriminate quantitatively normal from pathological patterns in the EEG signal.   Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.   Results: Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82\\% while using bands alone arrived at 64\\%. A few feature combinations were identified to drive this distinction.   Conclusions: Brain states analysis distinguishes successfully controls from patients with MS. Our results imply that this data-driven cross-sectional comparison of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead in terms of quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope having established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies."

      "abstract": "High-precision acquisition of dense-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is often impeded by the costliness and lack of portability of equipment. In contrast, generating dense-channel EEG signals effectively from sparse channels shows promise and economic viability. However, sparse-channel EEG poses challenges such as reduced spatial resolution, information loss, signal mixing, and heightened susceptibility to noise and interference. To address these challenges, we first theoretically formulate the dense-channel EEG generation problem as by optimizing a set of cross-channel EEG signal generation problems. Then, we propose the YOAS framework for generating dense-channel data from sparse-channel EEG signals. The YOAS totally consists of four sequential stages: Data Preparation, Data Preprocessing, Biased-EEG Generation, and Synthetic EEG Generation. Data Preparation and Preprocessing carefully consider the distribution of EEG electrodes and low signal-to-noise ratio problem of EEG signals. Biased-EEG Generation includes sub-modules of BiasEEGGanFormer and BiasEEGDiffFormer, which facilitate long-term feature extraction with attention and generate signals by combining electrode position alignment with diffusion model, respectively. Synthetic EEG Generation synthesizes the final signals, employing a deduction paradigm for multi-channel EEG generation. Extensive experiments confirmed YOAS's feasibility, efficiency, and theoretical validity, even remarkably enhancing data discernibility. This breakthrough in dense-channel EEG signal generation from sparse-channel data opens new avenues for exploration in EEG signal processing and application."

With the advent of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs), the challenges and opportunities in multi-channel spike sorting have intensified. Real-time spike sorting is particularly crucial for closed-loop brain computer interface (BCI) applications, demanding efficient hardware implementations. This paper introduces L-Sort, an hardware design for real-time multi-channel spike sorting. Leveraging spike localization techniques, L-Sort achieves efficient spike detection and clustering without the need to store raw signals during detection. By incorporating median thresholding and geometric features, L-Sort demonstrates promising results in terms of accuracy and hardware efficiency. We assessed the detection and clustering accuracy of our design with publicly available datasets recorded using high-density neural probes (Neuropixel). We implemented our design on an FPGA and compared the results with state of the art. Results show that our designs consume less hardware resource comparing with other FPGA-based spike sorting hardware."

In this study, we collected ECoG recordings from 8 epilepsy patients and compared the decodability of individual finger flexion and hand gestures with the resting state, as a proxy for a one-dimensional brain-click. The results show that all individual finger flexion and hand gestures are equally decodable across multiple models and subjects (>98.0\\%). In particular, hand movements, involving index finger flexion, emerged as promising candidates for brain-clicks. When decoding among multiple hand movements, finger flexion appears to outperform hand gestures (96.2\\% and 92.5\\% respectively) and exhibit greater robustness against misclassification errors when all hand movements are included.

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance."

Since Fisher's ratio and Pearson Correlation are powerful measures actively used in the domain, we propose an integrated framework (FRPC integrated framework) that integrates Fisher's Ratio to select the best channel and Pearson correlation to select optimal filter banks and extract spectral and temporal features respectively. The framework is tested for a 2-class motor imagery classification on 2 open-source datasets and 1 collected dataset and compared with state-of-art work.

Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics."

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task.

Dynamic stopping methods enhance BCI system speed by deciding at any moment whether to output a result or wait for more information. Such approach leverages trial variance, allowing good trials to be detected earlier, thereby speeding up the process without significantly compromising accuracy. Existing dynamic stopping algorithms typically optimize measures such as symbols per minute (SPM) and information transfer rate (ITR). However, these metrics may not accurately reflect system performance for specific applications or user types. Moreover, many methods depend on arbitrary thresholds or parameters that require extensive training data. We propose a model-based approach that takes advantage of the analytical knowledge that we have about the underlying classification model. By using a risk minimisation approach, our model allows precise control over the types of errors and the balance between precision and speed. This adaptability makes it ideal for customizing BCI systems to meet the diverse needs of various applications. We validate our proposed method on a publicly available dataset, comparing it with established static and dynamic stopping methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach offers a broad range of accuracy-speed trade-offs and achieves higher precision than baseline stopping methods.",

Often used because of their ease of grading, even the best multiple choice (MC) tests, those using research based distractors (wrong answers) are intrinsically limited in the insights they provide due to two factors. When distractors do not reflect student beliefs they can be ignored, increasing the likelihood that the correct answer will be chosen by chance. Moreover, making the correct choice does not guarantee that the student understands why it is correct. To address these limitations, we recommend asking students to explain why they chose their answer, and why \"wrong\" choices are wrong. Using a discipline-trained artificial intelligence-based bot it is possible to analyze their explanations, identifying the concepts and scientific principles that maybe missing or misapplied. The bot also makes suggestions for how instructors can use these data to better guide student thinking. In a small \"proof of concept\" study, we tested this approach using questions from the Biology Concepts Instrument (BCI). The result was rapid, informative, and provided actionable feedback on student thinking. It appears that the use of AI addresses the weaknesses of conventional MC test. It seems likely that incorporating AI-analyzed formative assessments will lead to improved overall learning outcomes."

Understanding those dynamic changes and the neuronal networks involved is critical for understanding how the brain functions in health and disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a prevalent neuroimaging technique for studying these complex interactions. However, analyzing fMRI data poses several challenges. Furthermore, most approaches for analyzing Functional Connectivity (FC) still rely on preprocessing or conventional methods, often built upon oversimplified assumptions. On top of that, those approaches often ignore frequency-related information despite evidence showing that fMRI data contain rich information that spans multiple timescales. This study introduces a novel methodology, Multiscale Functional Connectivity (MFC), to analyze fMRI data by decomposing the fMRI into their intrinsic modes, allowing us to separate the neurophysiological activation patterns at multiple timescales while separating them from other interfering components. Additionally, the proposed approach accounts for the natural nonlinear and nonstationary nature of fMRI and the particularities of each individual in a data-driven way. We evaluated the performance of our proposed methodology using three fMRI experiments. Our results demonstrate that our novel approach effectively separates the fMRI data into different timescales while identifying highly reliable functional connectivity patterns across individuals. In addition, we further extended our knowledge of how the FC for these three experiments spans among different timescales."

Another practice that goes unchallenged is thresholding weighted FCs to remove spurious connections without justifying the chosen threshold. This paper leverages recent theoretical advances in Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) to formally define and quantify the information-theoretic fitness (e.g., prominence) of a predetermined set of FNs when mapped to individual FCs under different fMRI task conditions. Our framework allows for evaluating any combination of FC granularity, FN partition, and thresholding strategy, thereby optimizing these choices to preserve important topological features of the human brain connectomes.

Recent studies utilize deep learning approaches to learn the brain network representation based on functional connectivity (FC) profile, broadly falling into two main categories. The Fixed-FC approaches, utilizing the FC profile which represents the linear temporal relation within the brain network, are limited by failing to capture informative brain temporal dynamics. On the other hand, the Dynamic-FC approaches, modeling the evolving FC profile over time, often exhibit less satisfactory performance due to challenges in handling the inherent noisy nature of fMRI data.   To address these challenges, we propose Brain Masked Auto-Encoder (BrainMAE) for learning representations directly from fMRI time-series data. Our approach incorporates two essential components: a region-aware graph attention mechanism designed to capture the relationships between different brain ROIs, and a novel self-supervised masked autoencoding framework for effective model pre-training. These components enable the model to capture rich temporal dynamics of brain activity while maintaining resilience to inherent noise in fMRI data. Our experiments demonstrate that BrainMAE consistently outperforms established baseline methods by significant margins in four distinct downstream tasks. Finally, leveraging the model's inherent interpretability, our analysis of model-generated representations reveals findings that resonate with ongoing research in the field of neuroscience."

This study investigates whether music can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI) during its perception. Leveraging recent advancements in extensive datasets and pre-trained computational models, we construct mappings between neural data and latent representations of musical stimuli. Our approach integrates functional and anatomical alignment techniques to facilitate cross-subject decoding, addressing the challenges posed by the low temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI data. Starting from the GTZan fMRI dataset, where five participants listened to 540 musical stimuli from 10 different genres while their brain activity was recorded, we used the CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) model to extract latent representations of the musical stimuli and developed voxel-wise encoding models to identify brain regions responsive to these stimuli. By applying a threshold to the association between predicted and actual brain activity, we identified specific regions of interest (ROIs) which can be interpreted as key players in music processing. Our decoding pipeline, primarily retrieval-based, employs a linear map to project brain activity to the corresponding CLAP features. This enables us to predict and retrieve the musical stimuli most similar to those that originated the fMRI data. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art identification accuracy, with our methods significantly outperforming existing approaches. Our findings suggest that neural-based music retrieval systems could enable personalized recommendations and therapeutic applications.

      "abstract": "It was shown in literature that speech representations extracted by self-supervised pre-trained models exhibit similarities with brain activations of human for speech perception and fine-tuning speech representation models on downstream tasks can further improve the similarity. However, it still remains unclear if this similarity can be used to optimize the pre-trained speech models. In this work, we therefore propose to use the brain activations recorded by fMRI to refine the often-used wav2vec2.0 model by aligning model representations toward human neural responses. Experimental results on SUPERB reveal that this operation is beneficial for several downstream tasks, e.g., speaker verification, automatic speech recognition, intent classification.One can then consider the proposed method as a new alternative to improve self-supervised speech models."

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.",

      "abstract": "Deciphering language from brain activity is a crucial task in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric. This improvement demonstrates the advancement of our model towards real-world applications and underscores its potential in advancing BCI research.

While this approach can be useful in some experimental designs, it presents significant limitations for certain types of analyses, such as identifying the category of an object observed by a subject. In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels. We do this using two datasets; the Kaneshiro et al. (2015) dataset and the Gifford et al. (2022) dataset. Our results raise doubts about the true generalizability of several published models and suggests that the reported performance of these models may be significantly inflated."

      "abstract": "Growing interest and investment in the capabilities of foundation models has positioned such systems to impact a wide array of public services. Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the \"foundation\" layer, our framework proposes the \"subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the \"surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate \"subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer."

      "abstract": "Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural environment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group."

In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment.",

In this paper, we formally define and study the problem of identifying such minimal evidence groups (MEGs) for claim verification. We show that MEG identification can be reduced from Set Cover problem, based on entailment inference of whether a given evidence group provides full/partial support to a claim. Our proposed approach achieves 18.4% and 34.8% absolute improvements on the WiCE and SciFact datasets over LLM prompting.

Resting-state, eyes-closed recordings were source reconstructed using the standardized low-resolution brain electrographic tomography (sLORETA) method. We extracted low (slow) 6-9 Hz and high (fast) 10-11 Hz alpha relative band power and calculated the alpha power ratio by dividing low (slow) alpha by high (fast) alpha. This ratio was computed for all brain regions in all individuals.   Alpha oscillations were slower in individuals with TLE than controls (p<0.05). This effect was present in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, and across widespread brain regions.   Alpha slowing in TLE was found in both EEG and MEG recordings.

This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation. All code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricsinaruto/MEG-transfer-decoding).",

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties.

We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

However, we still need a comprehensive view of the heart's magnetic activity at the tissue scale. To fill this gap, we present a model of soft active matter, including thermo-electric coupling, suitably modified to reproduce cardiac magnetic field. Our theoretical framework shows that periodic stimulations of cardiac cells create an external magnetic field evidencing restitution features of nonlinear cardiac dynamics and magnetic restitution curves better discriminate instabilities and bifurcations in cardiac activity. This new framework lays the foundation for innovative, non-invasive diagnostic tools for cardiac arrhythmias."

      "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is pivotal for probing the microstructure of the rapidly-developing fetal brain. However, fetal motion during scans and its interaction with magnetic field inhomogeneities result in artifacts and data scattering across spatial and angular domains. The effects of those artifacts are more pronounced in high-angular resolution fetal dMRI, where signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Those effects lead to biased estimates and compromise the consistency and reliability of dMRI analysis. This work presents HAITCH, the first and the only publicly available tool to correct and reconstruct multi-shell high-angular resolution fetal dMRI data. HAITCH offers several technical advances that include a blip-reversed dual-echo acquisition for dynamic distortion correction, advanced motion correction for model-free and robust reconstruction, optimized multi-shell design for enhanced information capture and increased tolerance to motion, and outlier detection for improved reconstruction fidelity. The framework is open-source, flexible, and can be used to process any type of fetal dMRI data including single-echo or single-shell acquisitions, but is most effective when used with multi-shell multi-echo fetal dMRI data that cannot be processed with any of the existing tools. Validation experiments on real fetal dMRI scans demonstrate significant improvements and accurate correction across diverse fetal ages and motion levels. HAITCH successfully removes artifacts and reconstructs high-fidelity fetal dMRI data suitable for advanced diffusion modeling, including fiber orientation distribution function estimation. These advancements pave the way for more reliable analysis of the fetal brain microstructure and tractography under challenging imaging conditions."

      "abstract": "Malaria remains one of the most pressing public health concerns globally, causing significant morbidity and mortality, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease management. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination of blood smears, are labor-intensive and require significant expertise, which may not be readily available in resource-limited settings. This project aims to automate the detection of malaria-infected cells using a deep learning approach. We employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture, leveraging transfer learning to enhance performance. The Malaria Cell Images Dataset from Kaggle, containing 27,558 images categorized into infected and uninfected cells, was used for training and evaluation. Our model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for assisting in malaria diagnosis. Additionally, a web application was developed using Streamlit to allow users to upload cell images and receive predictions about malaria infection, making the technology accessible and user-friendly. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the methodology, experiments, and results, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning in medical image analysis."

      "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant potential in assisting medical diagnosis by leveraging extensive biomedical datasets. However, the advancement of medical image understanding and reasoning critically depends on building high-quality visual instruction data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain, particularly in the medical domain. To mitigate this data-starving issue, we introduce Self-Training Large Language and Vision Assistant for Medical (STLLaVA-Med). The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences. We validate the efficacy and data efficiency of STLLaVA-Med across three major medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance with the utilization of only 9% of the medical data."

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The complex signal decay during the transient FLASH MRI readout can lead to artifacts in magnitude and phase images. We show that target-driven optimization of individual rf flip angles and phases can realize near-ideal signal behavior and mitigate artifacts. Methods The differentiable end-to-end optimization framework MR-zero is used to optimize rf trains of the FLASH sequence. We focus herein on minimizing deviations from the ideally spoiled signal by using a mono-exponential Look-Locker target. We first obtain the transient FLASH signal decay substructure, and then minimize the deviation to the Look-Locker decay by optimizing the individual (i) flip angles, (ii) rf phases and (iii) flip angles and rf phases. Comparison between measurement and simulation are performed using Pulseq in 1D and 2D. Results We could reproduce the complex substructure of the transient FLASH signal decay. All three optimization objectives can bring the real FLASH signal closer to the ideal case, with best results when both flip angles and rf phases are adjusted jointly. This solution outperformed all tested conventional quadratic rf cyclings in terms of (i) matching the Look-Locker target signal, (ii) phase stability, (iii) PSF ideality, (iv) robustness against parameter changes, and (v) magnitude and phase image quality. Other target functions for the signal could as well be realized, yet, their response is not as general as for the Look-Locker target and need to be optimized for a specific context. Conclusion Individual flip angle and rf phase optimization improves the transient signal decay of FLASH MRI sequences."

Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose."

      "abstract": "Chirality, an inherent property of most objects of the universe, is a dynamic research topic in material science, physics, chemistry, and biology. The fundamental appeal of this extensive study is supported by the technological quest to manufacture materials with configurable chiralities for emerging applications ranging from optoelectronics and photonics to pharmaceutics and medicine. Recent advances put forth ferroelectrics as a host of chiral topological states in the form of Bloch domain walls, skyrmions, merons, and Hopfions, offering thus a unique ground for making chirality switchable and tunable. Here we review current developments, milestones achieved, and future routes of chiral ferroelectric materials. We focus on insights into the topological origin of the chirality in the nanostructured ferroelectrics, bringing new controllable functionalities. We pay special attention to novel developments enabling tunability and manipulating the chiroptical response and enantioselectivity, leading to new applications in nano-optoelectronics, plasmonics, pharmaceutics, and bio-medical industries."

However, the state-of-the-art RUSs still rely on a human operator to apply the ultrasound gel. The lack of standardization in this process often leads to poor imaging of the scanned region. The reason for this has to do with air-gaps between the probe and the human body. In this paper, we developed a end-of-arm tool for RUS, referred to as UltraGelBot. This bot can autonomously detect and dispense the gel. It uses a deep learning model to detect the gel from images acquired using an on-board camera. A motorized mechanism is also developed, which will use this feedback and dispense the gel. Experiments on phantom revealed that UltraGelBot increases the acquired image quality by $18.6\\%$ and reduces the procedure time by $37.2\\%$."

      "abstract": "Reproducibility remains a significant challenge in machine learning (ML) for healthcare. In this field, datasets, model pipelines, and even task/cohort definitions are often private, leading to a significant barrier in sharing, iterating, and understanding ML results on electronic health record (EHR) datasets. In this paper, we address a significant part of this problem by introducing the Automatic Cohort Extraction System for Event-Stream Datasets (ACES). This tool is designed to simultaneously simplify the development of task/cohorts for ML in healthcare and enable the reproduction of these cohorts, both at an exact level for single datasets and at a conceptual level across datasets. To accomplish this, ACES provides (1) a highly intuitive and expressive configuration language for defining both dataset-specific concepts and dataset-agnostic inclusion/exclusion criteria, and (2) a pipeline to automatically extract patient records that meet these defined criteria from real-world data. ACES can be automatically applied to any dataset in either the Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) or EventStreamGPT (ESGPT) formats, or to *any* dataset for which the necessary task-specific predicates can be extracted in an event-stream form. ACES has the potential to significantly lower the barrier to entry for defining ML tasks, redefine the way researchers interact with EHR datasets, and significantly improve the state of reproducibility for ML studies in this modality.

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown considerable potential in medical image segmentation, primarily leveraging consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. However, many SSL approaches only pay attention to low-level consistency and overlook the significance of pseudo-label reliability. Therefore, in this work, we propose an adversarial self-training consistency framework (AstMatch). Firstly, we design an adversarial consistency regularization (ACR) approach to enhance knowledge transfer and strengthen prediction consistency under varying perturbation intensities. Second, we apply a feature matching loss for adversarial training to incorporate high-level consistency regularization. Additionally, we present the pyramid channel attention (PCA) and efficient channel and spatial attention (ECSA) modules to improve the discriminator's performance. Finally, we propose an adaptive self-training (AST) approach to ensure the pseudo-labels' quality. The proposed AstMatch has been extensively evaluated with cutting-edge SSL methods on three public-available datasets. The experimental results under different labeled ratios indicate that AstMatch outperforms other existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/GuanghaoZhu663/AstMatch."
