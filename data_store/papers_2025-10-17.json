      "abstract": "Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies. Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.   We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks. It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph learning.",

      "abstract": "The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain, often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However, conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200 stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above 0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development and clinical research.",

However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.",

We evaluate EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy, achieving up to 17\\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting the interpretability of the approach.

By producing realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters, ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original (real) dataset.

However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure, outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate future evaluation on real data.",

Electroencephalography (EEG), with its high temporal resolution, offers a cost-effective method to assess brain dynamics. This study investigates WM-related EEG functional connectivity (FC) to identify brain network alterations across dementia stages. Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 24 participants (8 AD, 8 MCI, and 8 healthy controls) during WM tasks, including encoding, recall, and retrieval stages.

FC was quantified using Cross-Plot Transition Entropy (CPTE) and Phase Lag Index (PLI). Network metrics such as Degree and Eigenvector Centrality were analyzed using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Results: The CPTE-based connectivity metrics outperformed the traditional PLI approach in differentiating dementia stages, attaining a peak classification accuracy of 97.53% during the retrieval phase with the Random Forest model. A connectivity threshold of 0.5 was optimal for network discrimination. SHD and HHD features also demonstrated strong discriminative potential.

We establish the existence and uniqueness (for almost all time horizons) and develop a projected gradient method for their computation. To enable scalability, we construct a target-only reduced virtual system and derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that weak cross-coupling and a low or negative logarithmic norm of the system matrix yield accurate approximations of target VCS/AECS, particularly over short or moderate time horizons. Experiments on human brain networks reveal a clear trade-off: at short horizons, both target VCS and target AECS are well approximated by their reduced formulations, while at long horizons, target AECS remains robust but target VCS deteriorates.",

Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama 2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels. Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational linguistics and cognitive neuroscience.

Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance.

Selecting the most relevant channels is crucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights into neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on Effective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity (EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one neural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow of information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel selection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among channels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to three well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved calculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics: partial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC (RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on the effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification across all participants. Results were compared with other CSP-based methods. The evaluation included comparing participant- specific accuracies with and without the proposed method across five effective connectivity metrics. The results showed consistent performance improvements and a significant reduction in the number of selected electrodes for all participants.

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods.

However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions.

      "abstract": "The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli is an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets, four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and overlapping information.",

We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset.

However, conventional encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid. We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses: (1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns; modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D space.",

Experiments across multiple multimodal backbones and subjects show consistent improvements over strong baselines, enhanced cross-subject generalization, and interpretable expert patterns that correlate with content type. The framework offers a simple attachment point for new encoders and datasets, enabling robust, plug-and-improve performance for naturalistic neuroimaging studies.",

Traditional self-supervised learning methods inspired by computer vision often rely on positive and negative sample pairs, which can be problematic for neuroimaging data where defining appropriate contrasts is non-trivial. We propose adapting a recently developed Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA) to graph-structured fMRI data, providing a theoretically grounded approach that measures statistical dependence via density ratio decomposition in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),and applies HFMCA-based pretraining to learn robust and generalizable representations. Evaluations across five neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that our adapted method produces competitive embeddings for various classification tasks and enables effective knowledge transfer to unseen datasets.

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.",

While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset.

In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement.

FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity.

These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives.

For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain.

To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

BiTMedViT utilizes ternary- quantized linear layers tailored for medical imaging and com- bines a training procedure with multi-query attention, preserving stability under ternary weights with low-precision activations. Furthermore, BiTMedViT employs task-aware distillation from a high-capacity teacher to recover accuracy lost due to extreme quantization. Lastly, we also present a pipeline that maps the ternarized ViTs to a custom CUDA kernel for efficient memory bandwidth utilization and latency reduction on the Jetson Orin Nano. Finally, BiTMedViT achieves 86% diagnostic accuracy (89% SOTA) on MedMNIST across 12 datasets, while reducing model size by 43x, memory traffic by 39x, and enabling 16.8 ms inference at an energy efficiency up to 41x that of SOTA models at 183.62 GOPs/J on the Orin Nano.

      "abstract": "Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart. More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) - which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.",

Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.",

Despite advancements in imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1 explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based.

Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks.

Generally, this is carried out based on the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only. Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model, and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous attenuation correction.",

We propose integrating steerable conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure, outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate future evaluation on real data.",
