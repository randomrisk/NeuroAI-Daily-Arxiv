This paper explores what types of personal and health information have been detected and classified within task-free EEG data. Additionally, we investigate key characteristics of the collected resting-state and sleep data, in order to determine the privacy risks involved with openly available EEG data. We used Google Scholar, Web of Science and searched relevant journals to find studies which classified or detected the presence of various disorders and personal information in resting state and sleep EEG. Only English full-text peer-reviewed journal articles or conference papers about classifying the presence of medical disorders between individuals were included. A quality analysis carried out by 3 reviewers determined general paper quality based on specified evaluation criteria. In resting state EEG, various disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parkinson's disease, and alcohol use disorder have been classified with high classification accuracy, often requiring only 5 mins of data or less. Sleep EEG tends to hold classifiable information about sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, and REM sleep disorder, but usually involve longer recordings or data from multiple sleep stages. Many classification methods are still developing but even today, access to a person's EEG can reveal sensitive personal health information. With an increasing ability of machine learning methods to re-identify individuals from their EEG data, this review demonstrates the importance of anonymization, and the development of improved tools for keeping study participants and medical EEG users' privacy safe.",

We introduce a static BCFP that mirrors the bond-convolution used by directed message-passing GNNs like ChemProp, and evaluate it with a fast rapid Random Forest model on Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration (BBBP) classification task. Across stratified cross-validation, concatenating ECFP with BCFP consistently improves AUROC and AUPRC over either descriptor alone, as confirmed by Turkey HSD multiple-comparison analysis. Among radii, r = 1 performs best; r = 2 does not yield statistically separable gains under the same test. We further propose BCFP-Sort&Slice, a simple feature-combination scheme that preserves the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) count information native to ECFP count vectors while enabling compact unhashed concatenation of BCFP variants. We also outperform the MGTP prediction on our BBBP evaluation, using such composite new features bond and atom features. These results show that lightweight, bond-centered descriptors can complement atom-centered circular fingerprints and provide strong, fast baselines for BBBP prediction.",

In this study, we introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\\%$ fewer parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical image segmentation.

      "abstract": "Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.",

      "abstract": "Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast, higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task, model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation. Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more complex visual experiences.",

In this work, we present an RL-based DBS approach that adapts these stimulation parameters according to brain activity measurable in vivo. Using a TD3 based RL agent trained on a model of the basal ganglia region of the brain, we see a greater suppression of biomarkers correlated with PD severity compared to modern clinical DBS implementations.

We incorporated actual gradient fields of X, Y, and Z gradient coils in the calculation of the shimming coefficients in dynamic slice-by-slice B0 field shimming to minimize B0 field inhomogeneity (i.e., Delta B0) in deep-learning segmented brain tissues. Diffusion MRI with oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) at 55 Hz and pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) (approximated at 0 Hz) were obtained in phantoms and healthy volunteers using a head-only high-performance gradient 3T MRI system. In each diffusion MRI acquisition, standard static volumetric shimming and the proposed shimming method were applied separately, and mean/axial/radial diffusivities (MD/AD/RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were estimated. In phantom, the root-mean-square of Delta B0 in areas with high gradient nonlinearity was reduced by 7 Hz when incorporating actual gradient field in dynamic shimming. Compared to static shimming, dynamic shimming reduced root-mean-square of voxel displacement of each slice by a maximum of 5-10 voxels in single-shot EPI acquisition at 1-2 mm in-plane resolution in phantom, and a maximum of 3 voxels in human brains. Improved accuracy of MD/AD/RD/FA in the superior region of the brain, brainstem, and cerebellum were observed by applying dynamic shimming and/or two-shot EPI acquisition. MD(55 Hz)-MD(0 Hz) showed higher values in T2 FSE hypo-intensity region by applying dynamic shimming. We concluded that diffusion MRI with brain tissue-selective, dynamic slice-by-slice B0 effectively improves the accuracy of diffusivity characterization in high-resolution images.",

Deep learning models have been developed to accurately delineate these tumors. However, most of these models were trained on relatively homogenous high-resource datasets, limiting their robustness when deployed in underserved regions. In this study, we performed segmentation-aware offline data augmentation on the BraTS-Africa dataset to increase the data sample size and diversity to enhance generalization. We further constructed an ensemble of three distinct architectures, MedNeXt, SegMamba, and Residual-Encoder U-Net, to leverage their complementary strengths. Our best-performing model, MedNeXt, was trained on 1000 epochs and achieved the highest average lesion-wise dice and normalized surface distance scores of 0.86 and 0.81 respectively. However, the ensemble model trained for 500 epochs produced the most balanced segmentation performance across the tumour subregions. This work demonstrates that a combination of advanced augmentation and model ensembling can improve segmentation accuracy and robustness on diverse and underrepresented datasets.

A balanced signed graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data.

Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex, resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped EEG-measurements.

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods.

EEG signal processing, feature extraction, and assessment of cognitive and affective states were recurrent across studies. Innovative interventions such as virtual reality and neurofeedback demonstrate EEG's role in supporting adaptive and individualized learning experiences.

      "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.",

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods.

To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories.

The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP).

The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed far-field location through phase manipulation.",

Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others, current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and hardware settings.

These issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery (MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability, and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework: MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2 percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.

On synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings, including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting the finite samples appropriately.",

      "abstract": "Recordings of brain activity, such as functional MRI (fMRI), provide low-dimensional, indirect observations of neural dynamics evolving in high-dimensional, unobservable spaces. Embedding observed brain dynamics into a higher-dimensional representation may help reveal functional organization, but precisely how remains unclear. Hamiltonian mechanics suggests that, by introducing an additional dimension of conjugate momenta, the dynamical behaviour of a conservative system can be formulated in a more compact and mathematically elegant manner. Here we develop a physics-informed, data-driven framework that lifts whole-brain activity to the complex-valued field. Specifically, we augment observed signals (generalized coordinates) with latent ``dark signals'' that play the role of conjugate momenta in a whole-brain Hamiltonian system. We show that the Hilbert transform provides an augmentation approach with optimal fitting accuracy within this framework, yielding a Schr\\\"odinger-like equation governing complex-valued, augmented brain dynamics. Empirically, this complex-valued model consistently outperforms its real-valued counterpart, improving short-horizon prediction in the linear regime (correlation 0.12$\\to$0.82) and achieving superior fits under nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics (0.47$\\to$0.88). The framework strengthens structure-function coupling, recovers hierarchical intrinsic timescales, and yields biologically plausible directed effective connectivity that varies systematically with age and reconfigures from rest to task via global rescaling plus targeted rewiring. Together, these results establish a principled, testable paradigm for network neuroscience and offer transformative insight into the spatiotemporal organization and functional roles of large-scale brain dynamics.",

BrainHarmonix is grounded in two foundational neuroscience principles: structure complements function - structural and functional modalities offer distinct yet synergistic insights into brain organization; function follows structure - brain functional dynamics are shaped by cortical morphology. The modular pretraining process involves single-modality training with geometric pre-alignment followed by modality fusion through shared brain hub tokens.

BrainHarmonix achieves strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder classification and cognition prediction - consistently outperforming previous approaches.

For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain.

To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation.

However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices.

The global Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection.

      "abstract": "Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains.

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

      "abstract": "Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.",

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

KEEP first generates embeddings from knowledge graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships. Importantly, KEEP produces final embeddings without task specific auxiliary or end to end training enabling KEEP to support multiple downstream applications and model architectures. Evaluations on structured EHR from UK Biobank and MIMIC IV demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional and Language Model based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical outcomes.

We used Google Scholar, Web of Science and searched relevant journals to find studies which classified or detected the presence of various disorders and personal information in resting state and sleep EEG.

A quality analysis carried out by 3 reviewers determined general paper quality based on specified evaluation criteria. In resting state EEG, various disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parkinson's disease, and alcohol use disorder have been classified with high classification accuracy, often requiring only 5 mins of data or less. Sleep EEG tends to hold classifiable information about sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, and REM sleep disorder, but usually involve longer recordings or data from multiple sleep stages. Many classification methods are still developing but even today, access to a person's EEG can reveal sensitive personal health information.

However, the underutilization of these guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient narratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent cognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical scenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations. Our system leverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on a synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation pairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC knowledge base. This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9% top-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for selection and evidence-based synthesis. We evaluate our architecture using GPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match accuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set was identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. This represents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong standalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our architecture makes to a frontier model.

Neglecting viscosity-temperature effect and convergent gap forming could underestimate the load-carrying capacity of the fluid film; smaller contacting force but larger maximum contacting pressure are found comparing with the THD and HD results; performance keeps varying at steady speed due to thermal lag effect.

      "abstract": "Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement. While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain: (1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of \"ground truth,\" as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii) domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare.",

The medical question summary (MQS) task aims to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs), but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of question focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First, a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. Then, a fine-tuning dataset is constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the ability to identify the focus of the question. Finally, a multi-dimensional quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three established evaluation metrics. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a notable mitigation of hallucinations.
