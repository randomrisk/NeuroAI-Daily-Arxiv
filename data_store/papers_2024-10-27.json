      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method, named geodesic deformable networks (GDN), that for the first time enables the learning of geodesic flows of deformation fields derived from images. In particular, the capability of our proposed GDN being able to predict geodesics is important for quantifying and comparing deformable shape presented in images. The geodesic deformations, also known as optimal transformations that align pairwise images, are often parameterized by a time sequence of smooth vector fields governed by nonlinear differential equations. A bountiful literature has been focusing on learning the initial conditions (e.g., initial velocity fields) based on registration networks. However, the definition of geodesics central to deformation-based shape analysis is blind to the networks. To address this problem, we carefully develop an efficient neural operator to treat the geodesics as unknown mapping functions learned from the latent deformation spaces. A composition of integral operators and smooth activation functions is then formulated to effectively approximate such mappings. In contrast to previous works, our GDN jointly optimizes a newly defined geodesic loss, which adds additional benefits to promote the network regularizability and generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDN on both 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

Given the apparent straightforward character of the model and the generality of the result, we formulate a hypothesis based on the closeness of the scaling measures of the model to the empirical complexity measures of the human brain. CC is a proper model for describing the recent experimental results, such as the rehabilitation in walking arm in arm and the complexity synchronization effect. The CC effect can lead to the design of mutual-adaptive signals to restore the misaligned complexity of maladjusted organ networks or, on the other hand, to disrupt the complexity of a malicious system and lower its intelligent behavior."

However, low-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) hinders accurate diagnosis. This paper presents our work in the BraTS Challenge on SSA Adult Glioma. We adopt the model from the BraTS-GLI 2021 winning solution and utilize it with three training strategies: (1) initially training on the BraTS-GLI 2021 dataset with fine-tuning on the BraTS-Africa dataset, (2) training solely on the BraTS-Africa dataset, and (3) training solely on the BraTS-Africa dataset with 2x super-resolution enhancement. Results show that initial training on the BraTS-GLI 2021 dataset followed by fine-tuning on the BraTS-Africa dataset has yielded the best results. This suggests the importance of high-quality datasets in providing prior knowledge during training. Our top-performing model achieves Dice scores of 0.882, 0.840, and 0.926, and Hausdorff Distance (95%) scores of 15.324, 37.518, and 13.971 for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively, in the validation phase. In the final phase of the competition, our approach successfully secured second place overall, reflecting the strength and effectiveness of our model and training strategies.

With the more realistic coupling function and the coupling strength inhomogeneity, each oscillator acquires an effective intrinsic frequency proportional to its individual coupling strength. This is analogous to the positive coupling strength-frequency correlation introduced explicitly or implicitly in some previous models with nonidentical oscillators that show explosive synchronization and hysteresis. Through numerical simulations and analysis using truncated Gaussian, uniform, and truncated power-law coupling strength distributions, we observe that the system can exhibit abrupt phase transitions and hysteresis. The distribution of coupling strengths significantly affects the hysteresis regions within the parameter space of the coupling function. Additionally, numerical simulations of models with weighted networks including a brain network confirm the existence of hysteresis due to the realistic coupling function and coupling strength inhomogeneity, suggesting the broad applicability of our findings to complex real-world systems."

The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain."

Despite the numerous registration models that have been proposed, existing methods still fall short in terms of accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we present MsMorph, a deep learning-based image registration framework aimed at mimicking the manual process of registering image pairs to achieve more similar deformations, where the registered image pairs exhibit consistency or similarity in features. By extracting the feature differences between image pairs across various as-pects using gradients, the framework decodes semantic information at different scales and continuously compen-sates for the predicted deformation field, driving the optimization of parameters to significantly improve registration accuracy. The proposed method simulates the manual approach to registration, focusing on different regions of the image pairs and their neighborhoods to predict the deformation field between the two images, which provides strong interpretability. We compared several existing registration methods on two public brain MRI datasets, including LPBA and Mindboggle. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state of the art in terms of metrics such as Dice score, Hausdorff distance, average symmetric surface distance, and non-Jacobian.

In parallel, spiking GNNs with brain-like spiking neurons are drawing increasing research attention owing to the energy efficiency. So far, existing spiking GNNs consider graphs in Euclidean space, ignoring the structural geometry, and suffer from the high latency issue due to Back-Propagation-Through-Time (BPTT) with the surrogate gradient. In light of the aforementioned issues, we are devoted to exploring spiking GNN on Riemannian manifolds, and present a Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG). In particular, we design a new spiking neuron on geodesically complete manifolds with the diffeomorphism, so that BPTT regarding the spikes is replaced by the proposed differentiation via manifold. Theoretically, we show that MSG approximates a solver of the manifold ordinary differential equation. Extensive experiments on common graphs show the proposed MSG achieves superior performance to previous spiking GNNs and energy efficiency to conventional GNNs.",

Despite this simple training objective, they have proved to be powerful AI tools. However, only predicting the next token results in top layer embedding vectors that are highly token-focused. There may be benefits in generating embedding vectors at each token position that better capture the overall meaning of longer sequences of future text. Recent studies matching brain scans with deep language models suggest that humans also predict upcoming words when listening or reading but consider multiple future tokens rather than just one.   This research investigates a new pretraining method called Future Token Prediction (FTP). In FTP, a large transformer encoder generates top layer embedding vectors for each token position, which, instead of being passed to a language head, are linearly and expansively projected to a pseudo-sequence, which is cross attended to by a small transformer decoder to predict the next N tokens forward from that position in the sequence.   The top layer embedding vectors from FTP models exhibit distinct properties compared to those from standard GPT models, varying smoothly along a text sequence as measured by cosine similarity between adjacent tokens. Text generated by FTP models show improved topic coherence compared to standard GPT-like models trained with the same prediction perplexity for the next single token. The vectors are shown to better represent the topic of text based on the results of text classification examples. On a toy, but complex, coding problem, FTP networks produce significantly better results than GPT networks."

Electrical pulses are chronically delivered in DBS to a disease-specific brain target via a surgically implanted electrode. The stimulating contact configuration, stimulation polarity, as well as amplitude, frequency, and pulse width of the DBS pulse sequence are utilized to optimize the therapeutic effect. In this paper, the utility of therapy individualization by means of patient-specific mathematical modeling is investigated with respect to a specific case of a patient diagnosed with Essential Tremor (ET). Two computational models are compared in their ability to elucidate the impact of DBS stimulation on the dentato-rubrothalamic tract: (i) a conventional model of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) and (ii) a well-established neural fiber activation modeling framework known as OSS-DBS. The simulation results are compared with tremor measured in the patient under different DBS settings using a smartphone application. The findings of the study highlight that temporally static VTA models do not adequately describe the differences in the outcomes of bipolar stimulation settings with switched polarity, whereas neural fiber activation models hold potential in this regard. However, it is noted that neither of the investigated models fully accounts for the measured symptom pattern, particularly regarding a bilateral effect produced by unilateral stimulation."

However, the limited amount of data in comparison to other machine learning problems and the distributional shift between different EEG recordings emphasizes the need for a self supervised approach that works with limited data to achieve a more robust solution.

Currently, various EEG diagnostic algorithms based on deep learning have been developed. However, most research efforts focus solely on diagnosing and classifying current signal data but do not consider the prediction of future trends for early warning. Additionally, since multi-channel EEG can be essentially regarded as the spatio-temporal signal data received by detectors at different locations in the brain, how to construct spatio-temporal information representations of EEG signals to facilitate future trend prediction for multi-channel EEG becomes an important problem. This study proposes a multi-signal prediction algorithm based on generative diffusion models (EEG-DIF), which transforms the multi-signal forecasting task into an image completion task, allowing for comprehensive representation and learning of the spatio-temporal correlations and future developmental patterns of multi-channel EEG signals. Here, we employ a publicly available epilepsy EEG dataset to construct and validate the EEG-DIF. The results demonstrate that our method can accurately predict future trends for multi-channel EEG signals simultaneously. Furthermore, the early warning accuracy for epilepsy seizures based on the generated EEG data reaches 0.89. In general, EEG-DIF provides a novel approach for characterizing multi-channel EEG signals and an innovative early warning algorithm for epilepsy seizures, aiding in optimizing and enhancing the clinical diagnosis process.

Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods.

The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study.

However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams).

Then we performed trial-wise binary classification (i.e., decoding) using neural networks (EEGNet), or time-resolved logistic regressions. Our findings demonstrate that preprocessing choices influenced decoding performance considerably. All artifact correction steps reduced decoding performance across all experiments and models, while higher high-pass filter cutoffs consistently enhanced decoding. For EEGNet, baseline correction further improved performance, and for time-resolved classifiers, linear detrending and lower low-pass filter cutoffs were beneficial. Other optimal preprocessing choices were specific for each experiment. The current results underline the importance of carefully selecting preprocessing steps for EEG-based decoding.

      "abstract": "Despite the research and implementation efforts involving various safety strategies, protocols, and technologies, work zone crashes and fatalities continue to occur at an alarming rate each year. This study investigates the neurophysiological responses to Augmented Reality safety warnings in roadway work zones under varying workload conditions. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, we objectively assessed situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load in simulated low-intensity (LA) and moderate-intensity (MA) work activities. The research analyzed key EEG indicators including beta, gamma, alpha, and theta waves, as well as various combined wave ratios. Results revealed that AR warnings effectively triggered neurological responses associated with increased situational awareness and attention across both workload conditions. However, significant differences were observed in the timing and intensity of these responses. In the LA condition, peak responses occurred earlier (within 125 ms post-warning) and were more pronounced, suggesting a more robust cognitive response when physical demands were lower. Conversely, the MA condition showed delayed peak responses (125-250 ms post-warning) and more gradual changes, indicating a potential impact of increased physical activity on cognitive processing speed. These findings underscore the importance of considering physical workload when designing AR-based safety systems for roadway work zones. The research contributes to the understanding of how AR can enhance worker safety and provides insights for developing more effective, context-aware safety interventions in high-risk work environments."

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.",

This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification. However, these methods often require complex tuning and extensive data, limiting immediate applicability. iFuzzyTL introduces an adaptive framework that combines fuzzy logic principles with neural network architectures, focusing on efficient knowledge transfer and domain adaptation. iFuzzyTL refines input signal processing and classification in a human-interpretable format by integrating fuzzy inference systems and attention mechanisms. This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance."

Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants.

However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning."

Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training.

The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain."

One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP)."

Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control."

Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current brain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen subjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals based on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain activities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized to unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first consolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and fMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain decoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a learning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead of employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in previous methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore the generalization capability across different subjects. A series of experiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the network exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of training subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular network architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization performance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal the inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the emerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a brain decoding foundation model in the future.

After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding."

      "abstract": "Predicting the neural response to natural images in the visual cortex requires extracting relevant features from the images and relating those feature to the observed responses. In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models."

      "abstract": "The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces."

Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.

We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \\( t \\) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \\( t \\) assumption.

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

      "abstract": "Neuroscience has long been an essential driver of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

      "abstract": "Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a significant interest in developing large multimodal models (LMMs) capable of performing various visual reasoning and understanding tasks. This has led to the introduction of multiple LMM benchmarks to evaluate LMMs on different tasks. However, most existing LMM evaluation benchmarks are predominantly English-centric. In this work, we develop a comprehensive LMM evaluation benchmark for the Arabic language to represent a large population of over 400 million speakers. The proposed benchmark, named CAMEL-Bench, comprises eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding to evaluate broad scenario generalizability. Our CAMEL-Bench comprises around 29,036 questions that are filtered from a larger pool of samples, where the quality is manually verified by native speakers to ensure reliable model assessment. We conduct evaluations of both closed-source, including GPT-4 series, and open-source LMMs. Our analysis reveals the need for substantial improvement, especially among the best open-source models, with even the closed-source GPT-4o achieving an overall score of 62%. Our benchmark and evaluation scripts are open-sourced."

      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities. In some cases, however, this decline is more pronounced, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Early detection of anomalous cognitive decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention. While medical data can help in this detection, it often involves invasive procedures. An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not necessarily affect daily activities. This survey reviews the most relevant methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing. We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models. In addition, we present works that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models. We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. From this review, several conclusions emerge. In most cases, the textual modality achieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitive decline. Moreover, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios."

However, those instruction-tuned LLMs often perform poorly in specialized medical natural language understanding (NLU) tasks that require domain knowledge, granular text comprehension, and structured data extraction. To bridge the gap, we: (1) propose a unified prompting format for 7 important NLU tasks, % through span extraction and multi-choice question-answering (QA), (2) curate an instruction-tuning dataset, MNLU-Instruct, utilizing diverse existing open-source medical NLU corpora, and (3) develop BioMistral-NLU, a generalizable medical NLU model, through fine-tuning BioMistral on MNLU-Instruct. We evaluate BioMistral-NLU in a zero-shot setting, across 6 important NLU tasks, from two widely adopted medical NLU benchmarks: Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) and Biomedical Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark (BLURB). Our experiments show that our BioMistral-NLU outperforms the original BioMistral, as well as the proprietary LLMs - ChatGPT and GPT-4. Our dataset-agnostic prompting strategy and instruction tuning step over diverse NLU tasks enhance LLMs' generalizability across diverse medical NLU tasks. Our ablation experiments show that instruction-tuning on a wider variety of tasks, even when the total number of training instances remains constant, enhances downstream zero-shot generalization."

In this work, we present the first quantum simulation of conical intersections (CIs) in a biomolecule, cytosine, using a superconducting quantum computer. We apply the Contracted Quantum Eigensolver (CQE) -- with comparisons to conventional Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) -- to compute the near-degenerate ground and excited states associated with the conical intersection, a key feature governing the photostability of DNA and RNA. The CQE is based on an exact ansatz for many-electron molecules in the absence of noise -- a critically important property for resolving strongly correlated states at CIs. Both methods demonstrate promising accuracy when compared with exact diagonalization, even on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, highlighting their potential for advancing the understanding of photochemical and photobiological processes. The ability to simulate these intersections is critical for advancing our knowledge of biological processes like DNA repair and mutation, with potential implications for molecular biology and medical research."

Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.",

Despite advancements in diffusion MRI (dMRI) microstructure techniques, models specifically designed to estimate myelin sheath radii remain unavailable. In this proof-of-concept theoretical study, we present two novel dMRI models that characterize the signal from water diffusion confined to cylindrical surfaces, approximating myelin water diffusion. We derive their spherical mean signals, which conveniently eliminate fiber orientation and dispersion effects. These models are further extended to account for multiple concentric cylinders, mimicking the layered structure of myelin. Additionally, we introduce a method to convert histological distributions of axonal inner radii from the literature into myelin sheath radius distributions and derive analytical expressions to estimate the effective myelin sheath radius expected from these distributions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations conducted in cylindrical and spiral geometries validate the models, demonstrating agreement with analytical predictions across various diffusion regimes and significant correlations between the effective radii estimated from the histological distributions and the effective radius obtained by fitting the resulting dMRI signal to a single-cylinder model. These models may be integrated into existing multi-compartment dMRI techniques, opening the door to non-invasive, in vivo assessments of myelin sheath radii in MRI scanners equipped with strong diffusion gradients that enable measurements with short echo times. Further work is required to validate the technique with real dMRI data."

To address this limitation, we explore the transfer of grasping strategies between various gripper designs, enabling the use of data from diverse sources. In this work, we present an approach based on equivariant diffusion that facilitates gripper-agnostic encoding of scenes containing graspable objects and gripper-aware decoding of grasp poses by integrating gripper geometry into the model. We also develop a dataset generation framework that produces cluttered scenes with variable-sized object heaps, improving the training of grasp synthesis methods. Experimental evaluation on diverse object datasets demonstrates the generalizability of our approach across gripper architectures, ranging from simple parallel-jaw grippers to humanoid hands, outperforming both single-gripper and multi-gripper state-of-the-art methods."

Despite this trend, the adoption of AI in real-world healthcare is still limited. One of the main reasons is the trustworthiness of AI models and the potential hesitation of domain experts with model predictions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques aim to address these issues. However, explainability can mean different things to people with different backgrounds, expertise, and goals. To address the target audience with diverse needs, we develop storytelling XAI. In this research, we have developed an approach that combines multi-task distillation with interpretability techniques to enable audience-centric explainability. Using multi-task distillation allows the model to exploit the relationships between tasks, potentially improving interpretability as each task supports the other leading to an enhanced interpretability from the perspective of a domain expert. The distillation process allows us to extend this research to large deep models that are highly complex. We focus on both model-agnostic and model-specific methods of interpretability, supported by textual justification of the results in healthcare through our use case. Our methods increase the trust of both the domain experts and the machine learning experts to enable a responsible AI."

We motivate this setup in the common medical scenario of semantic metastases segmentation in a full-body PET/CT. We show how existing semantic segmentation metrics suffer from a bias towards larger connected components contradicting the clinical assessment of scans in which tumor size and clinical relevance are uncorrelated. To rebalance existing segmentation metrics, we propose to evaluate them on a per-component basis thus giving each tumor the same weight irrespective of its size. To match predictions to ground-truth segments, we employ a proximity-based matching criterion, evaluating common metrics locally at the component of interest. Using this approach, we break free of biases introduced by large metastasis for overlap-based metrics such as Dice or Surface Dice. CC-Metrics also improves distance-based metrics such as Hausdorff Distances which are uninformative for small changes that do not influence the maximum or 95th percentile, and avoids pitfalls introduced by directly combining counting-based metrics with overlap-based metrics as it is done in Panoptic Quality."

In medical imaging, the aim is often to place a 2D image in a 3D volumetric observation to w. Current approaches for rigid single slice in volume registration are limited by requirements such as pose initialization, stacks of adjacent slices, or reliable anatomical landmarks. Here, we propose a self-supervised 2D/3D registration approach to match a single 2D slice to the corresponding 3D volume. The method works in data without anatomical priors such as images of tumors. It addresses the dimensionality disparity and establishes correspondences between 2D in-plane and 3D out-of-plane rotation-equivariant features by using group equivariant CNNs. These rotation-equivariant features are extracted from the 2D query slice and aligned with their 3D counterparts. Results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed slice-in-volume registration on the NSCLC-Radiomics CT and KIRBY21 MRI datasets, attaining an absolute median angle error of less than 2 degrees and a mean-matching feature accuracy of 89% at a tolerance of 3 pixels."
