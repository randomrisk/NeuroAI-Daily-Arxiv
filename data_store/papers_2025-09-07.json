      "abstract": "Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography (PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis, leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217 measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason, problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans, a successor \"digital species\", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain, joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However, the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not silicon.",

      "abstract": "Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme, enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs, thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits (~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual coding in biological and artificial neural networks.",

Yet, while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\\%$ agreement with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation, providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.",

Existing approaches rely on contrast enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few annotations are available for training, since the feature representation benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across different domains.

Using distributions inspired by quantum phenomena including Porter Thomas distributions, Haar random states, and hyperuniform point processes, our approach generates diverse high quality partitions that improve modularity on difficult low Q graphs. We demonstrate 15 to 25% gains in modularity Q over classical methods (Louvain, Leiden). We define a \"Modularity Recovery Gap\" (MRG), the increase in Q achieved by quantum inspired refinement, and show this serves as a powerful anomaly detection signal. In experiments on high modularity networks (CTU 13 botnet traffic), MRG is near zero, confirming our method doesn't inflate modularity when no hidden structure exists. Results suggest quantum inspired sampling substantially enhances community detection in low modularity regimes, with applications in cybersecurity (stealthy APT/botnet detection), financial contagion modeling, disrupted supply chains, diseased brain connectomes, and crisis era social media analysis. Our refinements expand the search space of algorithms like Leiden without altering the graph, revealing partitions classical heuristics miss.

In particular, conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation, providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical validations.

We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation, connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.

However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) may offer a promising, unobtrusive means of assessing a user's momentary state of presence. Unlike traditional questionnaires, EEG does not interrupt the experience or rely on users' retrospective self-reports, thereby avoiding interference with the very state it aims to capture. Previous research has attempted to quantify presence in virtual environments using event-related potentials (ERPs). We contend, however, that previous efforts have fallen short of fully realizing this goal, failing to either A) independently manipulate presence, B) validate their measure of presence against traditional techniques, C) adequately separate the constructs of presence and attention, and/or D) implement a realistic and immersive environment and task. We address these shortcomings in a preregistered ERP experiment in which participants play an engaging target shooting game in VR. ERPs are time-locked to the release of a ball from a sling. We induce breaks in presence (BIPs) by freezing the ball's release on a minority of trials. Embodiment is manipulated by allowing manual manipulation of the sling with a realistic avatar in one condition (embodied condition) and passive manipulation with only controllers in another (non-embodied condition). We support our predictions that the N2, the P3b, and the N400, are selectively sensitive towards specific components of these manipulations.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.",

This study explores the limit of decoding non-invasive EEG associated with handwriting imagery into English letters using deep neural networks. To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the 26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific patterns in the dataset. Subsequently, four convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained for EEG classification. Descriptively, the EEG data clearly exhibited letter-specific patterns serving as a proof-of-concept for EEG-to-text translation. Under the chance level of accuracy at 3.85%, the CNN classifiers trained on each participant reached the highest limit of around 20%. This study marks the first attempt to decode non-invasive EEG associated with handwriting imagery. Although the achieved accuracy is not sufficient for a usable brain-to-text BCI, the model's performance is noteworthy in revealing the potential for translating non-invasively recorded brain signals into text outputs and establishing a baseline for future research.",

One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model.

To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\\deg}C Hot, 20{\\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.",

We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading.

The network connection probability serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment, which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical model.

However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

These findings offer initial insights into the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and adapt to complex AI systems.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.",

Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.",

We organize this design space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and graph featurization.

Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity, alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve classification accuracy over standard pipelines.

In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions.

Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation.

However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices.

On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.",

The global Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection.

However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real Xray images.

Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few annotations are available for training, since the feature representation benefits from the shared task structure.

We investigated whether clinical megavoltage (MV) radiotherapy beams can serve as dual-purpose sources, delivering therapeutic dose while simultaneously generating high-flux entangled photon pairs for quantum ghost imaging, quantum theranostics (QTX), and related applications. Using GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled water-equivalent phantoms containing 2 cm spherical tumors loaded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 10 mg/mL). Clinical spectra at 6, 10, and 15 MV were simulated. Key metrics included 511 keV photon-pair yield, positronium lifetimes (time-resolved), Doppler and energy broadening (energy-resolved), signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and entanglement retention at depths from 5 to 15 cm. Pair yields scaled with beam energy and AuNP concentration, reaching about 10^8 pairs per Gy per cm^3 in AuNP-loaded tumors. Positronium lifetime shifts (about 100 ps) reflected tumor oxygenation and reactive oxygen species, offering potential functional biomarkers. Doppler (1-3 keV) and AuNP-induced line broadening (0.5-1 keV) produced distinct spectroscopic signatures of electron density, tissue composition, and nanoparticle uptake. Time-resolved QTX revealed oxygenation and ROS levels, energy-resolved QTX probed tissue density and atomic composition, and combined modes enabled comprehensive theranostic imaging. Depth-dependent simulations achieved voxel SNRs exceeding 100. These findings demonstrate that clinical MV beams can serve as practical, high-flux entangled photon sources. Integrated time- and energy-resolved QTX supports functional and spectroscopic tumor imaging, enables nanoparticle optimization, and expands quantum imaging platforms from optical (eV) to therapeutic (hundreds of keV) regimes.",
