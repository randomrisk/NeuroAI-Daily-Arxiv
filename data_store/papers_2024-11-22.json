      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Vision-brain understanding aims to extract semantic information about brain signals from human perceptions. Existing deep learning methods for vision-brain understanding are usually introduced in a traditional learning paradigm missing the ability to learn the connectivities between brain regions. Meanwhile, the quantum computing theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the connectivities in the brain signals and the entanglement properties in quantum computing, we propose a novel Quantum-Brain approach, a quantum-inspired neural network, to tackle the vision-brain understanding problem. To compute the connectivity between areas in brain signals, we introduce a new Quantum-Inspired Voxel-Controlling module to learn the impact of a brain voxel on others represented in the Hilbert space. To effectively learn connectivity, a novel Phase-Shifting module is presented to calibrate the value of the brain signals. Finally, we introduce a new Measurement-like Projection module to present the connectivity information from the Hilbert space into the feature space. The proposed approach can learn to find the connectivities between fMRI voxels and enhance the semantic information obtained from human perceptions. Our experimental results on the Natural Scene Dataset benchmarks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Top-1 accuracies of 95.1% and 95.6% on image and brain retrieval tasks and an Inception score of 95.3% on fMRI-to-image reconstruction task. Our proposed quantum-inspired network brings a potential paradigm to solving the vision-brain problems via the quantum computing theory."

In this paper, we present the Predictive evidence Accumulation Models (PAM), a novel computational framework that integrates predictive processes into EAMs. Grounded in the \"observing the observer\" framework, PAM combines models of Bayesian perceptual inference, such as the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, with three established EAMs (the Diffusion Decision Model, Lognormal Race Model, and Race Diffusion Model) to model decision-making under uncertainty. We validate PAM through parameter recovery simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and computational efficiency across various decision-making scenarios. Additionally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial using real data to illustrate PAM's application and discuss its theoretical implications. PAM represents a significant advancement in the computational modeling of decision-making, bridging the gap between predictive brain theories and EAMs, and offers a promising tool for future empirical research."

      "abstract": "We examine the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising can enable the training of more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.",

However, deep learning models suffer from a scarcity of brain MRI datasets for effective training. Self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide data-efficient and remarkable solutions to limited dataset problems. Therefore, this paper introduces a generative SSL model for brain tumor classification in two stages. The first stage is designed to pre-train a Residual Vision Transformer (ResViT) model for MRI synthesis as a pretext task. The second stage includes fine-tuning a ResViT-based classifier model as a downstream task. Accordingly, we aim to leverage local features via CNN and global features via ViT, employing a hybrid CNN-transformer architecture for ResViT in pretext and downstream tasks. Moreover, synthetic MRI images are utilized to balance the training set. The proposed model performs on public BraTs 2023, Figshare, and Kaggle datasets. Furthermore, we compare the proposed model with various deep learning models, including A-UNet, ResNet-9, pix2pix, pGAN for MRI synthesis, and ConvNeXtTiny, ResNet101, DenseNet12, Residual CNN, ViT for classification. According to the results, the proposed model pretraining on the MRI dataset is superior compared to the pretraining on the ImageNet dataset. Overall, the proposed model attains the highest accuracy, achieving 90.56% on the BraTs dataset with T1 sequence, 98.53% on the Figshare, and 98.47% on the Kaggle brain tumor datasets. As a result, the proposed model demonstrates a robust, effective, and successful approach to handling insufficient dataset challenges in MRI analysis by incorporating SSL, fine-tuning, data augmentation, and combining CNN and ViT."

However, challenges such as the high cost of labeled data and variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals limit the applicability of EEG-based emotion recognition models across domains. These challenges are exacerbated in cross-dataset scenarios due to differences in subject demographics, recording devices, and presented stimuli. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to improve cross-domain EEG-based emotion classification. Our method, Gradual Proximity-guided Target Data Selection (GPTDS), incrementally selects reliable target domain samples for training. By evaluating their proximity to source clusters and the models confidence in predicting them, GPTDS minimizes negative transfer caused by noisy and diverse samples. Additionally, we introduce Prediction Confidence-aware Test-Time Augmentation (PC-TTA), a cost-effective augmentation technique. Unlike traditional TTA methods, which are computationally intensive, PC-TTA activates only when model confidence is low, improving inference performance while drastically reducing computational costs. Experiments on the DEAP and SEED datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. When trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, our model achieves 67.44% accuracy, a 7.09% improvement over the baseline. Conversely, training on SEED and testing on DEAP yields 59.68% accuracy, a 6.07% improvement. Furthermore, PC-TTA reduces computational time by a factor of 15 compared to traditional TTA methods.

      "abstract": "Geometric shape features have been widely used as strong predictors for image classification. Nevertheless, most existing classifiers such as deep neural networks (DNNs) directly leverage the statistical correlations between these shape features and target variables. However, these correlations can often be spurious and unstable across different environments (e.g., in different age groups, certain types of brain changes have unstable relations with neurodegenerative disease); hence leading to biased or inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that for the first time develops invariant shape representation learning (ISRL) to further strengthen the robustness of image classifiers. In contrast to existing approaches that mainly derive features in the image space, our model ISRL is designed to jointly capture invariant features in latent shape spaces parameterized by deformable transformations. To achieve this goal, we develop a new learning paradigm based on invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn invariant representations of image and shape features across multiple training distributions/environments. By embedding the features that are invariant with regard to target variables in different environments, our model consistently offers more accurate predictions. We validate our method by performing classification tasks on both simulated 2D images, real 3D brain and cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance images (MRIs).

In this context, time-locked EEG activity or event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used to capture neural activity related to specific mental processes. Normally, they are considered on the basis of averages across a number of trials. However, there exist notable variability in latency jitter, jitter, and amplitude, across trials, and, also, across users; this causes the average ERP waveform to blur, and, furthermore, diminish the amplitude of underlying waves. For these reasons, a strategy is proposed for obtaining ERP waveforms based on dynamic time warping (DTW) to adapt, and adjust individual trials to the averaged ERP, previously calculated, to build an enhanced average by making use of these warped signals. At the sight of the experiments carried out on the behaviour of the proposed scheme using publicly available datasets, this strategy reduces the attenuation in amplitude of ERP components thanks to the reduction of the influence of variability of latency and jitter, and, thus, improves the averaged ERP waveforms."

The quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the interacting agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and states from the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits and states in relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we developed a pipeline to extract latent dimensions of the brain from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a team flow task. Our pipeline involved two stages of dimensionality reduction: first, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This pipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG latent space that revealed a trait-state hierarchical structure, with macro-segregation capturing neural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural states. Out of the seven latent dimensions, we found that three that significantly contributed to variations across individuals and task states. Using representational similarity analysis, we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space, establishing a connection between hidden neural signatures and social interaction behaviors. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of representing both traits and states within a single model that correlates with changes in social behavior."

Using the MM task as the analysis framework, we observe that - a) speech perception is fragmented based on word boundaries, b) acoustic and semantic cues offer similar levels of MM task performance in natural listening conditions, and c) semantic cues offer significantly improved MM classification over acoustic cues in dichotic listening task. Further, the study provides evidence of right ear advantage in dichotic listening conditions."

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition has significant potential in healthcare and affect-sensitive systems such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, challenges such as the high cost of labeled data and variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals limit the applicability of EEG-based emotion recognition models across domains. These challenges are exacerbated in cross-dataset scenarios due to differences in subject demographics, recording devices, and presented stimuli. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to improve cross-domain EEG-based emotion classification. Our method, Gradual Proximity-guided Target Data Selection (GPTDS), incrementally selects reliable target domain samples for training. By evaluating their proximity to source clusters and the models confidence in predicting them, GPTDS minimizes negative transfer caused by noisy and diverse samples. Additionally, we introduce Prediction Confidence-aware Test-Time Augmentation (PC-TTA), a cost-effective augmentation technique. Unlike traditional TTA methods, which are computationally intensive, PC-TTA activates only when model confidence is low, improving inference performance while drastically reducing computational costs. Experiments on the DEAP and SEED datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. When trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, our model achieves 67.44% accuracy, a 7.09% improvement over the baseline. Conversely, training on SEED and testing on DEAP yields 59.68% accuracy, a 6.07% improvement. Furthermore, PC-TTA reduces computational time by a factor of 15 compared to traditional TTA methods. Our method excels in detecting both positive and negative emotions, demonstrating its practical utility in healthcare applications.

The framework includes two essential components: user identification and intention classification, which enable personalized services by identifying individual users and recognizing their intended actions through EEG signals. We validate the feasibility of our framework using a private EEG dataset collected from eight subjects, employing the ShallowConvNet architecture to decode EEG features. The experimental results demonstrate that user identification achieved an average classification accuracy of 0.995, while intention classification achieved 0.47 accuracy across all paradigms, with MI demonstrating the best performance. These findings indicate that EEG signals can effectively support personalized BCI applications, offering robust identification and reliable intention decoding, especially for MI and SI."

Variability in classification accuracy across individual classes highlights the influence of sensory and motor associations in imagined speech and vivid visual associations in visual imagery. Connectivity analysis further demonstrated increased functional connectivity in language-related and sensory regions for imagined speech, whereas visual imagery activated spatial and visual processing networks. These findings suggest the potential of imagined speech and visual imagery as an intuitive and scalable paradigm for BCI communication when selecting optimal word classes. Further exploration of the decoding outcomes for these two paradigms could provide insights for practical BCI communication."

Most research so far studied more accurate BCIs, but much less attention has been paid to the ethics of BCIs. Aside from task-specific information, EEG signals also contain rich private information, e.g., user identity, emotion, disorders, etc., which should be protected. Approach: We show for the first time that adding user-wise perturbations can make identity information in EEG unlearnable. We propose four types of user-wise privacy-preserving perturbations, i.e., random noise, synthetic noise, error minimization noise, and error maximization noise. After adding the proposed perturbations to EEG training data, the user identity information in the data becomes unlearnable, while the BCI task information remains unaffected. Main results: Experiments on six EEG datasets using three neural network classifiers and various traditional machine learning models demonstrated the robustness and practicability of the proposed perturbations. Significance: Our research shows the feasibility of hiding user identity information in EEG data without impacting the primary BCI task information."

Most existing BCI studies focused on improving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial security. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in other application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed that their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on benign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of data alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers simultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets from two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event related potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers (EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings (offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online cross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its effectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are usually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously improve the model accuracy and robustness.",

While retraining on the entire dataset with each new input can prevent forgetting, this approach incurs high computational costs. An ideal brain-computer interface (BCI) model should continuously learn new information without retraining from scratch, thus reducing these costs. Most transfer learning models rely on large source-domain datasets for pre-training, yet data availability is frequently limited in real-world applications due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, such models are prone to catastrophic forgetting in continual EEG decoding tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a personalized subject-incremental learning (SIL) framework for continual EEG decoding that integrates Euclidean Alignment for fast domain adaptation, an exemplar replay mechanism to retain prior knowledge, and reservoir sampling-based memory management to handle memory constraints in long-term learning. Validated on the OpenBMI dataset with 54 subjects, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention with classification performance in continual MI-EEG tasks, offering a scalable solution for real-world BCI applications."

However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies."

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the non-invasive tools used in BCI systems, providing high temporal resolution for real-time applications. However, EEG signals are often affected by a low signal-to-noise ratio, physiological artifacts, and individual variability, representing challenges in extracting distinct features. Also, motor imagery (MI)-based EEG signals could contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics, which might cause the weights of the deep model to become biased towards those features. To address these problems, we proposed the end-to-end deep preprocessing method that effectively enhances MI characteristics while attenuating features with low correlation to MI characteristics. The proposed method consisted of the temporal, spatial, graph, and similarity blocks to preprocess MI-based EEG signals, aiming to extract more discriminative features and improve the robustness. We evaluated the proposed method using the public dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV to compare the performances when integrating the proposed method into the conventional models, including the DeepConvNet, the M-ShallowConvNet, and the EEGNet. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve the improved performances and lead to more clustered feature distributions of MI tasks. Hence, we demonstrated that our proposed method could enhance discriminative features related to MI characteristics."

We conducted scalp topography analysis to examine activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, revealing distinct regional differences: sense--related conditions primarily activated the posterior region of the sensorimotor cortex, while motor--related conditions activated the anterior region of the sensorimotor cortex. These spatial distinctions align with neurophysiological principles, suggesting condition-specific functional subdivisions within the sensorimotor cortex. We further evaluated the performances of three neural network models-EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet-demonstrating that ME tasks achieved higher classification accuracies compared to MI tasks. Specifically, in sense-related conditions, the highest accuracy was observed in the cold condition. In motor-related conditions, the pull condition showed the highest performance, with DeepConvNet yielding the highest results.

Existing deep learning methods for vision-brain understanding are usually introduced in a traditional learning paradigm missing the ability to learn the connectivities between brain regions. Meanwhile, the quantum computing theory offers a new paradigm for designing deep learning models. Motivated by the connectivities in the brain signals and the entanglement properties in quantum computing, we propose a novel Quantum-Brain approach, a quantum-inspired neural network, to tackle the vision-brain understanding problem. To compute the connectivity between areas in brain signals, we introduce a new Quantum-Inspired Voxel-Controlling module to learn the impact of a brain voxel on others represented in the Hilbert space. To effectively learn connectivity, a novel Phase-Shifting module is presented to calibrate the value of the brain signals. Finally, we introduce a new Measurement-like Projection module to present the connectivity information from the Hilbert space into the feature space. The proposed approach can learn to find the connectivities between fMRI voxels and enhance the semantic information obtained from human perceptions. Our experimental results on the Natural Scene Dataset benchmarks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Top-1 accuracies of 95.1% and 95.6% on image and brain retrieval tasks and an Inception score of 95.3% on fMRI-to-image reconstruction task.

However, when used as a precursor to independent component analysis (ICA) for blind source separation (BSS), sPCA may underperform due to its focus on simplicity, potentially disregarding some statistical information essential for effective ICA. To overcome this limitation, a sophisticated approach is proposed that preserves the interpretability advantages of sPCA while significantly enhancing its source extraction capabilities. This consists of two tailored algorithms, dissociative PCA (DPCA1 and DPCA2), which employ adaptive and firm thresholding alongside gradient and coordinate descent approaches to optimize the proposed model dynamically. These algorithms integrate left and right singular vectors from singular value decomposition (SVD) through dissociation matrices (DMs) that replace traditional singular values, thus capturing latent interdependencies effectively to model complex source relationships. This leads to refined PCs and LVs that more accurately represent the underlying data structure. The proposed approach avoids focusing on individual eigenvectors, instead, it collaboratively combines multiple eigenvectors to disentangle interdependencies within each SVD variate. The superior performance of the proposed DPCA algorithms is demonstrated across four varied imaging applications including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) source retrieval, foreground-background separation, image reconstruction, and image inpainting. They outperformed traditional methods such as PCA+ICA, PPCA+ICA, SPCA+ICA, PMD, and GPower."

Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of early- and mid-level visual areas. RNC generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. A large portion of representational content was shared across areas, unique representational content increased with cortical distance, and we isolated the visual features determining these effects. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network."

Embodied emotion theorists propose that this connection is not purely linguistic; perceiving an emotion may require somatosensory and motor re-experiencing. However, it remains unclear whether self-reports of emotion-related bodily sensations (i.e., 'lump in my throat') are related to neural simulations of bodily action and sensation or whether they can be explained by cognitive appraisals or the visual features of socioemotional signals. To investigate this, participants (N = 21) were shown arousing emotional images that varied in valence, complexity, and content while undergoing fMRI scans. Participants then rated the images on a set of emotion appraisal scales and indicated where, on a body map, they experienced sensation in response to the image. To derive normative models of responses on these scales, a separate larger online sample online (N = 56 - 128) also rated these images. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to compare the emotional content in the body maps with appraisals and visual features. A pairwise distance matrix between the body maps generated for each stimulus was then used in a whole brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis to identify brain regions which reflect the representational geometry of embodied emotion. This analysis revealed a network including bilateral primary somatosensory and motor cortices, precuneus, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between emotion and the body is not purely conceptual: It is supported by sensorimotor cortical activations."

While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous fusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural connectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better leverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood oxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by rs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships within the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish hetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community searching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further introduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances homo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information and preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the flexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data augmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue commonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective and superior to other algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of 93.3%."

While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets.

Over the past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across the whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that \"seeing\" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding stimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing. Additionally, we implemented zero-shot imagination decoding on an extra validation dataset, achieving a p-value of 0.0206 for mapping the reconstructed images and ground-truth text stimuli, which substantiates the model's capability to capture semantic meanings across various scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series."

In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3.

Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy."

Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data.

In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces."

Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

Arabic, with its complex morphology, syntax, and diglossia, poses unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) in medical contexts. This case study evaluates Sporo AraSum, a language model tailored for Arabic clinical documentation, against JAIS, the leading Arabic NLP model. Using synthetic datasets and modified PDQI-9 metrics modified ourselves for the purposes of assessing model performances in a different language. The study assessed the models' performance in summarizing patient-physician interactions, focusing on accuracy, comprehensiveness, clinical utility, and linguistic-cultural competence.   Results indicate that Sporo AraSum significantly outperforms JAIS in AI-centric quantitative metrics and all qualitative attributes measured in our modified version of the PDQI-9. AraSum's architecture enables precise and culturally sensitive documentation, addressing the linguistic nuances of Arabic while mitigating risks of AI hallucinations. These findings suggest that Sporo AraSum is better suited to meet the demands of Arabic-speaking healthcare environments, offering a transformative solution for multilingual clinical workflows. Future research should incorporate real-world data to further validate these findings and explore broader integration into healthcare systems."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice."

In this work, we propose and demonstrate a mini-spectrometer that combines a large-scale radiative cavity array with end-to-end deep learning networks. Specifically, we utilize high-Q bound states in continuum cavities with distinct radiation characteristics as the fundamental units to achieve parallel spectral detection. We realize a 36 $\\times$ 30 cavity array that spans a wide spectral range from 1525 to 1605 nm with quality factors above 10^4. We further train a deep network with 8000 outputs to directly map arbitrary spectra to array responses excited by the out-of-plane incident. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mini-spectrometer can resolve unknown spectra with a resolution of 0.048 nm in a bandwidth of 80 nm and fidelity exceeding 95%, thus offering a promising method for compact, high resolution, and broadband spectroscopy."

This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based system designed for such environments. It uses affordable hardware and robust software to monitor patients without constant internet access or extensive medical personnel. The system employs cost-effective sensors to track vital signs, including heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, eye movement, and body position. An energy-efficient microcontroller processes data locally, synchronizing with a central server when network access is available. A locally hosted app provides on-site access to patient data, while a GSM module sends immediate alerts for critical events, even in areas with limited cellular coverage. This solution emphasizes ease of deployment, minimal maintenance, and resilience to power and network disruptions. Using open-source software and widely available hardware, it offers a scalable, adaptable system for resource-limited settings. At under $30, the system is a sustainable, cost-effective solution for continuous patient monitoring, bridging the gap until more advanced healthcare infrastructure is available."

      "abstract": "As one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, plaque formation in human arteries, known as atherosclerosis, is the focus of many research efforts. Previously, molecular communication (MC) models have been proposed to capture and analyze the natural processes inside the human body and to support the development of diagnosis and treatment methods. In the future, synthetic MC networks are envisioned to span the human body as part of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), turning blood vessels into physical communication channels. By observing and characterizing changes in these channels, MC networks could play an active role in detecting diseases like atherosclerosis. In this paper, building on previous preliminary work for simulating an MC scenario in a plaque-obstructed blood vessel, we evaluate different analytical models for non-Newtonian flow and derive associated channel impulse responses (CIRs). Additionally, we add the crucial factor of flow pulsatility to our simulation model and investigate the effect of the systole-diastole cycle on the received particles across the plaque channel. We observe a significant influence of the plaque on the channel in terms of the flow profile and CIR across different emission times in the cycle. These metrics could act as crucial indicators for early non-invasive plaque detection in advanced future MC methods."

      "abstract": "In the field of medical image segmentation, challenges such as indistinct lesion features, ambiguous boundaries,and multi-scale characteristics have long revailed. This paper proposes an improved method named Intensity-Spatial Dual Masked AutoEncoder (ISD-MAE). Based on the tissue-contrast semi-masked autoencoder, a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) branch is introduced to perform intensity masking and spatial masking operations on chest CT images for multi-scale feature learning and segmentation tasks. The model utilizes a dual-branch structure and contrastive learning to enhance the ability to learn tissue features and boundary details. Experiments are conducted on multiple 2D and 3D datasets. The results show that ISD-MAE significantly outperforms other methods in 2D pneumonia and mediastinal tumor segmentation tasks. For example, the Dice score reaches 90.10% on the COVID19 LESION dataset, and the performance is relatively stable. However, there is still room for improvement on 3D datasets. In response to this, improvement directions are proposed, including optimizing the loss function, using enhanced 3D convolution blocks, and processing datasets from multiple perspectives.Our code is available at:https://github.com/prowontheus/ISD-MAE.",

      "abstract": "The reuse of historical clinical trial data has significant potential to accelerate medical research and drug development. However, interoperability challenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective data integration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automated coding without labeled data, current approaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novel compositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGN follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2) self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines, while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this cost-efficiently at \\$0.0007 and \\$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding for clinical trial data, contributing to enhanced data interoperability and reusability, positioning it as a promising tool to improve clinical research and accelerate drug development."

The proposed GraphCL model enjoys several advantages. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the data structure information for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). Secondly, to get the clustered features across different graphs, we integrate both pairwise affinities between local image features and raw features as inputs. Extensive experimental results on three standard benchmarks show that the proposed GraphCL algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods."

      "abstract": "Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful tool for untargeted, highly multiplexed molecular mapping of tissue in biomedical research. IMS offers a means of mapping the spatial distributions of molecular species in biological tissue with unparalleled chemical specificity and sensitivity. However, most IMS platforms are not able to achieve microscopy-level spatial resolution and lack cellular morphological contrast, necessitating subsequent histochemical staining, microscopic imaging and advanced image registration steps to enable molecular distributions to be linked to specific tissue features and cell types. Here, we present a virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue using a diffusion model. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with Periodic Acid-Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite utilizing IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach employs an optimized noise sampling technique during the diffusion model's inference process to reduce variance in the generated images, yielding reliable and repeatable virtual staining. We believe this virtual staining method will significantly expand the applicability of IMS in life sciences and open new avenues for mass spectrometry-based biomedical research."
