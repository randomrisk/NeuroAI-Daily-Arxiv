      "abstract": "A chemical discrimination system based on photonic reservoir computing is demonstrated experimentally for the first time. The system is inspired by the way humans perceive and process visual sensory information. The electro-optical reservoir computing system is a photonic analogue of the human nervous system with the read-out layer acting as the 'brain', and the sensor that of the human eye. A task-specific optimisation of the system is implemented, and the performance of the system for the discrimination between three chemicals is presented. The results are compared to the previously published numerical simulation. This publication provides a feasibility assessment and a demonstration of a practical realisation of photonic reservoir computing for a new neuromorphic sensing system - the next generation sensor with a built-in 'intelligence' which can be trained to 'understand' and to make a real time sensing decision based on the training data."

      "abstract": "Neurons in the brain are spatially organized such that neighbors on tissue often exhibit similar response profiles. In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain."

      "abstract": "Significant variations of delays among connecting neurons cause an inevitable disadvantage of asynchronous brain dynamics compared to synchronous deep learning. However, this study demonstrates that this disadvantage can be converted into a computational advantage using a network with a single output and M multiple delays between successive layers, thereby generating a polynomial time-series outputs with M. The proposed role of delay in brain dynamics (RoDiB) model, is capable of learning increasing number of classified labels using a fixed architecture, and overcomes the inflexibility of the brain to update the learning architecture using additional neurons and connections. Moreover, the achievable accuracies of the RoDiB system are comparable with those of its counterpart tunable single delay architectures with M outputs. Further, the accuracies are significantly enhanced when the number of output labels exceeds its fully connected input size. The results are mainly obtained using simulations of VGG-6 on CIFAR datasets and also include multiple label inputs. However, currently only a small fraction of the abundant number of RoDiB outputs is utilized, thereby suggesting its potential for advanced computational power yet to be discovered."

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence aids in brain tumor detection via MRI scans, enhancing the accuracy and reducing the workload of medical professionals. However, in scenarios with extremely limited medical images, traditional deep learning approaches tend to fail due to the absence of anomalous images. Anomaly detection also suffers from ineffective feature extraction due to vague training process. Our work introduces a novel two-stage anomaly detection algorithm called CONSULT (CONtrastive Self-sUpervised Learning for few-shot Tumor detection). The first stage of CONSULT fine-tunes a pre-trained feature extractor specifically for MRI brain images, using a synthetic data generation pipeline to create tumor-like data. This process overcomes the lack of anomaly samples and enables the integration of attention mechanisms to focus on anomalous image segments. The first stage is to overcome the shortcomings of current anomaly detection in extracting features in high-variation data by incorporating Context-Aware Contrastive Learning and Self-supervised Feature Adversarial Learning. The second stage of CONSULT uses PatchCore for conventional feature extraction via the fine-tuned weights from the first stage. To summarize, we propose a self-supervised training scheme for anomaly detection, enhancing model performance and data reliability. Furthermore, our proposed contrastive loss, Tritanh Loss, stabilizes learning by offering a unique solution all while enhancing gradient flow. Finally, CONSULT achieves superior performance in few-shot brain tumor detection, demonstrating significant improvements over PatchCore by 9.4%, 12.9%, 10.2%, and 6.0% for 2, 4, 6, and 8 shots, respectively, while training exclusively on healthy images."

      "abstract": "This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven flight computer, integrating an online free-retraining-prediction model, a swarm control, and an obstacle avoidance strategy, to track dynamic targets using a distributed drone swarm for military applications. To enable dynamic target tracking the swarm requires a trajectory prediction capability to achieve intercept allowing for the tracking of rapid maneuvers and movements while maintaining efficient path planning. Traditional predicative methods such as curve fitting or Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) have low robustness and struggle with dynamic target tracking in the short term due to slow convergence of single agent-based trajectory prediction and often require extensive offline training or tuning to be effective. Consequently, this paper introduces a novel robust adaptive bidirectional fuzzy brain emotional learning prediction (BFBEL-P) methodology to address these challenges. The controller integrates a fuzzy interface, a neural network enabling rapid adaption, predictive capability and multi-agent solving enabling multiple solutions to be aggregated to achieve rapid convergence times and high accuracy in both the short and long term. This was verified through the use of numerical simulations seeing complex trajectory being predicted and tracked by a swarm of drones. These simulations show improved adaptability and accuracy to state of the art methods in the short term and strong results over long time domains, enabling accurate swarm target tracking and predictive capability."

They can also unlock unique advantages for cryogenic applications like quantum computing, high-performance computing, and space exploration by improving speed and energy efficiency through parallel searching. This paper explores the design and implementation of a cryogenic ternary content addressable memory based on ferroelectric superconducting quantum interference devices (FeSQUIDs). The use of FeSQUID for designing the TCAM provides several unique advantages. First, we can get binary decisions (zero or non-zero voltage) for matching and mismatching conditions without using any peripheral circuitry. Moreover, the proposed TCAM needs ultra-low energy (1.36 aJ and 26.5 aJ average energy consumption for 1-bit binary and ternary search, respectively), thanks to the use of energy-efficient SQUIDs. Finally, we show the efficiency of FeSQUID through the brain-inspired application of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). Here, the FeSQUID-based TCAM implements the associative memory to support the highly parallel search needed in the inference step. We estimate an energy consumption of 89.4 fJ per vector comparison using a vector size of 10,000 bits. We also compare the FeSQUID-based TCAM array with the 5nm FinFET-based cryogenic SRAM-based TCAM array and observe that the proposed FeSQUID-based TCAM array consumes over one order of magnitude lower energy while performing the same task."

      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders can be understood as divergent patterns of neural interactions during brain development. Advances in neuroimaging have illuminated these patterns by modeling the brain as a network structure using diffution MRI tractography. However, characterizing and quantifying individual heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental disorders within these highly complex brain networks remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present for the first time, a framework that integrates deep generative models with graph-based normative modeling to characterize brain network development in the neurotypical population, which can then be used to quantify the individual-level neurodivergence associated with disorders. Our deep generative model incorporates bio-inspired wiring constraints to effectively capture the developmental trajectories of neurotypical brain networks. Neurodivergence is quantified by comparing individuals to this neurotypical trajectory, enabling the creation of region-wise divergence maps that reveal latent developmental differences at each brain regions, along with overall neurodivergence scores based on predicted brain age gaps. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this framework by applying it to a large sample of children with autism spectrum disorders, showing that the individualized region-wise maps help parse the heterogeneity in autism, and the neurodivergence scores correlate with clinical assessments. Together, we provide powerful tools for quantifying neurodevelopmental divergence in brain networks, paying the way for developing imaging markers that will support disorder stratification, monitor progression, and evaluate therapeutic effectiveness."

There is also substantial evidence that the brain encodes memories and processes information via sequences of neural activity. In this dissertation, we are focused on the general problem of how neural circuits encode rhythmic activity, as in central pattern generators (CPGs), as well as the encoding of sequences. Traditionally, rhythmic activity and CPGs have been modeled using coupled oscillators. Here we take a different approach, and present models for several different neural functions using threshold-linear networks. Our approach aims to unify attractor-based models (e.g., Hopfield networks) which encode static and dynamic patterns as attractors of the network.   In the first half of this dissertation, we present several attractor-based models. These include: a network that can count the number of external inputs it receives; two models for locomotion, one encoding five different quadruped gaits and another encoding the orientation system of a swimming mollusk; and, finally, a model that connects the fixed point sequences with locomotion attractors to obtain a network that steps through a sequence of dynamic attractors. In the second half of the thesis, we present new theoretical results, some of which have already been published. There, we established conditions on network architectures to produce sequential attractors. Here we also include several new theorems relating the fixed points of composite networks to those of their component subnetworks, as well as a new architecture for layering networks which produces \"fusion\" attractors by minimizing interference between the attractors of individual layers."

      "abstract": "While end-to-end multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) learning approaches have shown significant promise, their applicability is often constrained in neurological diagnostics, such as intracranial EEG resources. When provided with a single-channel EEG, how can we learn representations that are robust to multi-channels and scalable across varied tasks, such as seizure prediction? In this paper, we present SplitSEE, a structurally splittable framework designed for effective temporal-frequency representation learning in single-channel EEG. The key concept of SplitSEE is a self-supervised framework incorporating a deep clustering task. Given an EEG, we argue that the time and frequency domains are two distinct perspectives, and hence, learned representations should share the same cluster assignment. To this end, we first propose two domain-specific modules that independently learn domain-specific representation and address the temporal-frequency tradeoff issue in conventional spectrogram-based methods. Then, we introduce a novel clustering loss to measure the information similarity. This encourages representations from both domains to coherently describe the same input by assigning them a consistent cluster. SplitSEE leverages a pre-training-to-fine-tuning framework within a splittable architecture and has following properties: (a) Effectiveness: it learns representations solely from single-channel EEG but has even outperformed multi-channel baselines. (b) Robustness: it shows the capacity to adapt across different channels with low performance variance. Superior performance is also achieved with our collected clinical dataset. (c) Scalability: With just one fine-tuning epoch, SplitSEE achieves high and stable performance using partial model layers."

Therefore, in this study, we propose multivariate transfer entropy-based connectivity networks for cognitive events and introduce a new similarity measure, 'SimBrainNet', to assess these networks. A high similarity score suggests similar brain dynamics during cognitive events, indicating less attention variability. Our experiment involves 12 individuals with attention disorders (7 children and 5 adolescents).

By integrating philosophical insights and cognitive science, it clearly defines two typical modes of human behavior in human-machine interaction(HMI): skill-based intuitive behavior and knowledge-based intellectual behavior. Building on this, the concept of 'intuitive interaction flow' is innovatively introduced by combining human intuition with machine humanoid intelligence, leading to the construction of a dual-loop HMC task allocation model. Through comparative experiments measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) activities, distinct physiological patterns associated with these behavior modes are identified, providing a preliminary foundation for future adaptive HMC frameworks. This work offers a pathway for developing intelligent HMC systems that effectively integrate human intuition and machine intelligence in Industry 4.0."

This study investigates the feasibility of intention detection of left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants.

However, existing EEG attacks mainly focus on single-target class attacks, and they either require engaging the training stage of the target BCI, or fail to maintain high stealthiness. Addressing these limitations, Professor X exploits a three-stage clean label poisoning attack: 1) selecting one trigger for each class; 2) learning optimal injecting EEG electrodes and frequencies strategy with reinforcement learning for each trigger; 3) generating poisoned samples by injecting the corresponding trigger's frequencies into poisoned data for each class by linearly interpolating the spectral amplitude of both data according to previously learned strategies. Experiments on datasets of three common EEG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Professor X, which also easily bypasses existing backdoor defenses."

The model treats the EEG classification of each individual as an independent task and facilitates feature sharing across individuals. Our model consists of an impulsive neural population coupled with a convolutional encoder-decoder to extract shared features and a bidirectional associative memory matrix to map features to class. Experimental results in two BCI competition datasets show that our model improves average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and reduces performance variance across individuals, and the waveforms reconstructed by the bidirectional associative memory provide interpretability for the model's classification results. The neuronal firing patterns in our model are highly coordinated, similarly to the neural coding of hippocampal neurons, indicating that our model has biological similarities."

Each device promises better clinical outcomes and quality-of-life improvements, yet due to severe and inflexible safety constraints, progress requires tight co-design from materials to circuits and all the way up the stack to applications and algorithms. This trend has become more aggressive over time, forcing clinicians and patients to rely on vendor-specific hardware and software for deployment, maintenance, upgrades, and replacement. This over-reliance is ethically problematic, especially if companies go out-of-business or business objectives diverge from clinical promises. Device heterogeneity additionally burdens clinicians and healthcare facilities, adding complexity and costs for in-clinic visits, monitoring, and continuous access.   Reliability, interoperability, portability, and future-proofed design is needed, but this unfortunately comes at a cost. These system features sap resources that would have otherwise been allocated to reduce power/energy and improve performance. Navigating this trade-off in a systematic way is critical to providing patients with forever access to their implants and reducing burdens placed on healthcare providers and caretakers. We study the integration of on-device storage to highlight the sensitivity of this trade-off and establish other points of interest within BCI design that require careful investigation. In the process, we revisit relevant problems in computer architecture and medical devices from the current era of hardware specialization and modern neurotechnology."

After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding."

In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models."

      "abstract": "The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.",

However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities."

      "abstract": "While functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers valuable insights into cognitive processes, its inherent spatial limitations pose challenges for detailed analysis of the fine-grained functional architecture of the brain. More specifically, MRI scanner and sequence specifications impose a trade-off between temporal resolution, spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and scan time. Deep Learning (DL) Super-Resolution (SR) methods have emerged as a promising solution to enhance fMRI resolution, generating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images typically acquired with lower scanning times. However, most existing SR approaches depend on supervised DL techniques, which require training ground truth (GT) HR data, which is often difficult to acquire and simultaneously sets a bound for how far SR can go. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised DL SR model that combines a DL network with an analytical approach and Total Variation (TV) regularization. Our method eliminates the need for external GT images, achieving competitive performance compared to supervised DL techniques and preserving the functional maps."

      "abstract": "Echocardiography (ECHO) is essential for cardiac assessments, but its video quality and interpretation heavily relies on manual expertise, leading to inconsistent results from clinical and portable devices. ECHO video generation offers a solution by improving automated monitoring through synthetic data and generating high-quality videos from routine health data. However, existing models often face high computational costs, slow inference, and rely on complex conditional prompts that require experts' annotations. To address these challenges, we propose ECHOPULSE, an ECG-conditioned ECHO video generation model. ECHOPULSE introduces two key advancements: (1) it accelerates ECHO video generation by leveraging VQ-VAE tokenization and masked visual token modeling for fast decoding, and (2) it conditions on readily accessible ECG signals, which are highly coherent with ECHO videos, bypassing complex conditional prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use time-series prompts like ECG signals for ECHO video generation. ECHOPULSE not only enables controllable synthetic ECHO data generation but also provides updated cardiac function information for disease monitoring and prediction beyond ECG alone. Evaluations on three public and private datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in ECHO video generation across both qualitative and quantitative measures. Additionally, ECHOPULSE can be easily generalized to other modality generation tasks, such as cardiac MRI, fMRI, and 3D CT generation.

To study the association between individual brain connectivity networks and the clinical characteristics, we develop BSNMani: a Bayesian scalar-on-network regression model with manifold learning. BSNMani comprises two components: the network manifold learning model for brain connectivity networks, which extracts shared connectivity structures and subject-specific network features, and the joint predictive model for clinical outcomes, which studies the association between clinical phenotypes and subject-specific network features while adjusting for potential confounding covariates. For posterior computation, we develop a novel two-stage hybrid algorithm combining Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and Gibbs sampling. Our method is not only able to extract meaningful subnetwork features that reveal shared connectivity patterns, but can also reveal their association with clinical phenotypes, further enabling clinical outcome prediction. We demonstrate our method through simulations and through its application to real resting-state fMRI data from a study focusing on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Our approach sheds light on the intricate interplay between brain connectivity and clinical features, offering insights that can contribute to our understanding of psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as mental health."

Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT.

The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer.

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.

We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \\( t \\) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \\( t \\) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject."

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions."

Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG.

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "The classical solution to the Helmholtz wave equation in spherical coordinates is well known and has found many important applications in wave propagation, scattering, and imaging in optics and acoustics. The separable solution is comprised of spherical Bessel functions in the radial direction and spherical harmonics in the angular directions. The nature of the spherical Bessel functions includes a long asymptotic oscillatory tail at large radii, not conducive to applications where a tight concentration of wave amplitude around a ring is desired, for example in toroidal configurations. However, we have found that certain practical bandpass spectral shapes, centered around a peak frequency, can create a superposition of spherical Bessel functions that effectively concentrate the wave amplitude around a defined ring at the time instant of coherent addition, avoiding the long tail asymptotic oscillations of the single frequency solution. Theoretical solutions are shown for different bandpass spectra applied to the spherical Bessel functions, along with numerical solutions of transient wave propagation using practical hemispherical source shapes. These findings introduce a framework by which ring or toroidal concentrated waves can be produced with a simple bandpass superposition applied to hemispherical source shapes and with reference to the classical solutions in spherical coordinates."

Hollow microneedle devices are a promising solution to extract ISF on demand by penetrating the skin with minimal pain. However, they rely on inserting bio-incompatible materials (e.g., silicon) into individuals, limiting the application time. Here, the direct 3D printing of polymer hollow microneedles on silicon-based microfluidic devices and the successful in-vivo extraction of ISF are demonstrated. Our additive manufacturing approach enables the versatile combination of materials and rapid prototyping of microneedle geometry. After improving the design through finite element modeling, a hollow microneedle geometry was printed by two-photon polymerization and experimentally characterized with mechanical and fluidic tests. Microneedles were fabricated with high accuracy (i.e., 997 +/- 2 um) and reliably interfaced with the microfluidic chip (i.e., centerline alignment within 5% of diameter). The needles demonstrated sufficient mechanical strength (i.e., 411 +/- 3 mN per needle) to endure at least 10 consecutive insertions into simulated skin. Biocompatibility and ISF extraction were demonstrated in an in-vivo 72-hour test, showing the safety and reliability of our approach. Such a platform is promising for minimally invasive, continuous monitoring of biomarkers in ISF, aiding in medical diagnoses and personalized health treatments."

      "abstract": "A key component in developing atrial digital twins (ADT) - virtual representations of patients' atria - is the accurate prescription of myocardial fibers which are essential for the tissue characterization. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing atrial fibers from medical imaging, a widely used strategy for fiber generation in ADT relies on mathematical models. Existing methodologies utilze semi-automatic approaches, are tailored to specific morphologies, and lack rigorous validation against imaging fiber data. In this study, we introduce a novel atrial Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based Method (LDRBM) for prescribing highly detailed myofiber orientations and providing robust regional annotation in bi-atrial morphologies of any complexity. The robustness of our approach is verified in eight extremely detailed bi-atrial geometries, derived from a sub-millimiter Diffusion-Tensor-Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (DTMRI) human atrial fiber dataset. We validate the LDRBM by quantitatively recreating each of the DTMRI fiber architectures: a comprehensive comparison with DTMRI ground truth data is conducted, investigating differences between electrophysiology (EP) simulations provided by either LDRBM and DTMRI fibers. Finally, we demonstrate that the novel LDRBM outperforms current state-of-the-art fiber models, confirming the exceptional accuracy of our methodology and the critical importance of incorporating detailed fiber orientations in EP simulations. Ultimately, this work represents a fundamental step toward the development of physics-based digital twins of the human atria, establishing a new standard for prescribing fibers in ADT."

While Knowledge Graphs~(KGs) have been shown to help mitigate these issues, research on the integration of LLMs with background KGs remains limited. In particular, user accessibility and the flexibility of the underlying KG have not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AGENTiGraph (Adaptive Generative ENgine for Task-based Interaction and Graphical Representation), a platform for knowledge management through natural language interaction. It integrates knowledge extraction, integration, and real-time visualization. AGENTiGraph employs a multi-agent architecture to dynamically interpret user intents, manage tasks, and integrate new knowledge, ensuring adaptability to evolving user requirements and data contexts. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in knowledge graph interactions, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. Experimental results on a dataset of 3,500 test cases show AGENTiGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines, achieving 95.12\\% accuracy in task classification and 90.45\\% success rate in task execution. User studies corroborate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To showcase versatility, we extended AGENTiGraph to legislation and healthcare domains, constructing specialized KGs capable of answering complex queries in legal and medical contexts."

However, using an exponential moving average (EMA) in single-teacher models may cause coupling issues, where the weights of the student and teacher models become similar, limiting the teacher's ability to provide additional knowledge for the student. Dual-teacher models were introduced to address this problem but often neglected the importance of maintaining teacher model diversity, leading to coupling issues among teachers. To address the coupling issue, we incorporate a double-copy-paste (DCP) technique to enhance the diversity among the teachers. Additionally, we introduce the Staged Selective Ensemble (SSE) module, which selects different ensemble methods based on the characteristics of the samples and enables more accurate segmentation of label boundaries, thereby improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Here is the code link: https://github.com/Fazhan-cs/DCP.",

We show that the observed dyssynchrony is in accordance with other experimental methods. The PhysECG method may be considered a reduced solution to inverse problem of ECG imaging, which reconstructs the epicardial potentials and enables a good qualitative assessment of pathological changes. The foundations of the model are based on a molecular approach to biopotential propagation. We present the quality metrics for the reconstruction based on the model on testing set selected from the PTB database. The heart's activity in view of the method is decomposed into two disjoint processes: the passage of the electric activation wavefront and the response of cardiomyocytes. We introduce the idea of the electrode-resolved activity function, which represents the mass of the ventricle in Phase 0 of action potential within the lead field of each electrode. We also show the effects of the population distribution of the anatomical position of the septum with regard to the direction of the V3 electrode. We present and discuss four healthy controls: male and female, right bundle branch block, and anterior myocardial infarction. We demonstrate that the results obtained using PhysECG are in accordance with the functional changes evoked by pathology. The algorithm may be used to reconstruct the activity on any 12 lead or Holter recordings. The method offers limited power of ECG imaging based entirely on sole ECG, which presents an affordable solution accessible for low and middle-income countries where access to resource-demanding imaging modalities is limited."

The core is a low-dimensional temporal process based on a linear Gaussian state-space model with analytically tractable solutions for forecasting, simulation, and imputation of missing samples. The results, from two experiments on publicly available cardiac datasets, show reliable motion estimates and an improved forecasting performance using patient-specific adaptation by online learning."

      "abstract": "Effect modification occurs when a covariate alters the relative effectiveness of treatment compared to control. It is widely understood that, when effect modification is present, treatment recommendations may vary by population and by subgroups within the population. Population-adjustment methods are increasingly used to adjust for differences in effect modifiers between study populations and to produce population-adjusted estimates in a relevant target population for decision-making. It is also widely understood that marginal and conditional estimands for non-collapsible effect measures, such as odds ratios or hazard ratios, do not in general coincide even without effect modification. However, the consequences of both non-collapsibility and effect modification together are little-discussed in the literature.   In this paper, we set out the definitions of conditional and marginal estimands, illustrate their properties when effect modification is present, and discuss the implications for decision-making. In particular, we show that effect modification can result in conflicting treatment rankings between conditional and marginal estimates. This is because conditional and marginal estimands correspond to different decision questions that are no longer aligned when effect modification is present. For time-to-event outcomes, the presence of covariates implies that marginal hazard ratios are time-varying, and effect modification can cause marginal hazard curves to cross. We conclude with practical recommendations for decision-making in the presence of effect modification, based on pragmatic comparisons of both conditional and marginal estimates in the decision target population. Currently, multilevel network meta-regression is the only population-adjustment method capable of producing both conditional and marginal estimates, in any decision target population."

      "abstract": "The FLASH effect, characterized by potential sparing of organs at risk (OAR) through ultra-high dose rate irradiation, has garnered significant attention for its capability to address indications previously untreatable at conventional dose rates (DR) with hypofractionated schemes. While considerable biological research is needed to understand the FLASH effect and determine the FLASH modifying factors (FMF) for individual OARs, exploratory treatment planning studies have also emerged. This study aims to show that spinal metastases are candidate treatment sites likely to benefit from this phenomenon and establish the requisite FMFs to achieve the protective FLASH effect. A conformal FLASH Proton SBRT plan was generated for a patient with spine metastasis in a research version of RayStation11B (RaySearch laboratories AB, Stockhom) on an IBA Proteus Plus system. Two oblique posterior beams were used in the plan. The prescribed dose to the CTV was set according to 3 different fractionation regimens: 5 fractions (fx) of 7 Gy, 8 fx of 5 Gy, and 10 fx of 4.2 Gy. Spot filtering and sorting techniques were applied to maximize the 5% pencil beam scanning DR in the spinal cord (SC). The FLASH effect was assumed to be observed within irradiated regions above 40 Gy/s and 4 Gy per fraction. The generated plans successfully ensure robust target coverage in each fraction. The volume of SC that does not comply with the clinical goal adheres to the FLASH effect conditions in each fraction. Depending on the aforementioned fractionation schemes used, a FMF of approximately 0.6 to 0.8 is necessary to enable such treatment in FLASH conditions. Our study demonstrates the potential of hypofractionated FLASH PT in treating spine metastasis while preserving SC integrity. This approach could enable more effective treatment of spinal metastases, potentially preventing SC compression and paralysis in these patients."

We use here numerical simulations to explore the hydrodynamic coupling of cilia and mucus with these two properties using the Herschel--Bulkley model, in a lattice Boltzmann solver for the fluid flow. Three mucus flow regimes, i.e. a poorly organized regime, a swirly regime, and a fully unidirectional regime, are observed and analysed by parametric studies. We systematically investigate the effects of ciliary density, interaction length, Bingham number and flow index on the mucus flow regime formation. The underlying mechanism of the regime formation is analysed in detail by examining the variation of two physical quantities (polarization and integral length) and the evolution of the flow velocity, viscosity and shear-rate fields. Mucus viscosity is found to be the dominant parameter influencing the regime formation when enhancing the yield stress and shear thinning properties. The present model is able to reproduce the solid body rotation observed in experiments (Loiseau et al. , Nat. Phys. , vol. 16, 2020, pp. 1158--1164). A more precise prediction can be achieved by incorporating non-Newtonian properties into the modelling of mucus as proposed by Gsell et al. ( Sci. Rep. , vol. 10, 2020, 8405)."
