      "abstract": "Introduction: In neurosurgery, image-guided Neurosurgery Systems (IGNS) highly rely on preoperative brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) to assist surgeons in locating surgical targets and determining surgical paths. However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

      "abstract": "Quantitative imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), aim to extract interpretable pathology biomarkers by estimating biophysical tissue parameters from signal evolutions. However, the pattern-matching algorithms or neural networks used in such inverse problems often lack principled uncertainty quantification, which limits the trustworthiness and transparency, required for clinical acceptance. Here, we describe a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) designed for rapid extraction of voxelwise multi-parameter posterior distributions. Our approach integrates a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning, and provides a full covariance that captures the inter-parameter correlations of the latent biophysical space. The method was validated in a multi-proton pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) molecular MRF study, across in-vitro phantoms, tumor-bearing mice, healthy human volunteers, and a subject with glioblastoma. The resulting multi-parametric posteriors are in good agreement with those calculated using a brute-force Bayesian analysis, while providing an orders-of-magnitude acceleration in whole brain quantification. In addition, we demonstrate how monitoring the multi-parameter posterior dynamics across progressively acquired signals provides practical insights for protocol optimization and may facilitate real-time adaptive acquisition.",

Since its second wave, ADNI has increasingly collected resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a valuable resource for discovering brain connectivity changes predictive of cognitive decline and AD. A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments. As a result, many studies only utilize a small subset of the total rs-fMRI data, limiting statistical power, reproducibility, and the ability to study longitudinal functional brain changes at scale. Here, we describe a pipeline for ADNI rs-fMRI data that encompasses the download of necessary imaging and clinical data, temporally aligning the clinical and imaging data, preprocessing, and quality control. We integrate data curation and preprocessing across all ADNI sites and scanner types using a combination of open-source software (Clinica, fMRIPrep, and MRIQC) and bespoke tools. Quality metrics and reports are generated for each subject and session to facilitate rigorous data screening. All scripts and configuration files are available to enable reproducibility. The pipeline, which currently supports ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3 data releases, outputs high-quality rs-fMRI time series data adhering to the BIDS-derivatives specification.

The introduction of transformer architectures and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) has led to the development of EEG foundation models. These models are pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a range of downstream tasks. This systematic review summarizes recent SSL-trained EEG foundation models that learn whole-brain representations from multichannel EEG rather than representations derived from a single channel. We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and arXiv through July 21, 2025. Nineteen preprints and peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria. We extracted information regarding pretraining datasets, model architectures, pretraining SSL objectives, and downstream task applications. While pretraining data heavily relied on the Temple University EEG corpus, there was significant heterogeneity in model architecture and training objectives across studies. Transformer architectures were identified as the predominant pretraining architecture with state-space models such as MAMBA and S4 as emerging alternatives. Concerning SSL objectives, masked auto-encoding was most common, and other studies incorporate contrastive learning. Downstream tasks varied widely and implemented diverse fine-tuning strategies, which made direct comparison challenging. Furthermore, most studies used single-task fine-tuning, and a generalizable EEG foundation model remains lacking. In conclusion, the field is advancing rapidly but still limited by limited dataset diversity and the absence of standardized benchmarks. Progress will likely depend on larger and more diverse pretraining datasets, standardized evaluation protocols, and multi-task validation.

Our four-stage evaluation protocol reveals a critical failure: the invariance-based SSL model is fundamentally misaligned with the benchmark's topological properties and is catastrophically outperformed by classical, topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch: SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore the very community structure that classical methods exploit. Our results expose a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data.

      "abstract": "[Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for \"first-person\" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her \"subjective state\". We advocate a \"Principle of Self-Locating Indifference\" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of \"old evidence\".",

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

In this work, we explore whether language models can explicitly localize errors in incorrect reasoning, as a path toward building AI systems that can effectively correct themselves. We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines.",

The resulting data are used to construct derived outcomes that act as proxies for scientific outcomes that are not directly observable. Although intra-subject processing is widely used, its impact on inter-subject statistical inference has not been systematically studied, and a principled framework for causal analysis in this setting is lacking. In this article, we propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with derived outcomes obtained after intra-subject processing. This framework applies to settings with a modular structure, where intra-subject analyses are conducted independently across subjects and are followed by inter-subject analyses based on parameters from the intra-subject stage. We develop multiply robust estimators of causal parameters under rate conditions on both intra-subject and inter-subject models, which allows the use of flexible machine learning. We specialize the framework to a mediation setting and focus on the natural direct effect. For high dimensional inference, we employ a step-down procedure that controls the exceedance rate of the false discovery proportion. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence.

Building on this insight, we propose a Mutual-Guided Expert Collaboration (MGEC) framework that employs distinct network structures aligned with domain-specific and domain-invariant functions. Shared expert-guided learning captures reducible domain-invariant functions. Routed expert-guided learning employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to model irreducible domain-specific functions.

To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter.",

Trained on over 28,000 individuals, our model achieves a 7% Mean Absolute Error in EEG spectrogram reconstruction. Beyond reconstruction, the synthesized EEG supports downstream tasks with performance comparable to ground truth EEG on age estimation (MAE 5.0 vs. 5.1 years), sex detection (AUROC 0.81 vs. 0.82), and sleep staging (Accuracy 0.84 vs. 0.88), significantly outperforming baselines trained directly on breathing.

SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID.

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.",

This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.",

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample.

This study aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid electromagnetic (EM) simulation framework for efficient and accurate assessment of such interactions. Methods: A hybrid EM strategy integrating the Huygens' Box (HB) method with sub-gridding was implemented in an FDTD solver (Sim4Life). RF coil models for mouse and rat head were simulated with and without intracortical (IC) and epicortical (EC) graphene-based micro-transistor arrays. Three-dimensional multi-layered probe models were reconstructed from two-dimensional layouts, and transmit field ($B_{1}^{+}$), electric field ($E$), and specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions were evaluated. Performance was benchmarked against conventional full-wave multi-port (MP) simulations using Bland-Altman analysis and voxel-wise percentage differences. Results: HB simulations reduced computational time by approximately 70-80%, while preserving spatial patterns of $|B_{1}^{+}|$, $|E|$, and SAR, including transmit-field symmetry and localized high-field regions. Deviations from MP were minimal for $|B_{1}^{+}|$ (median $\u0394$% 0.02-0.07% in mice, -3.7% to -1.7% in rats) and modest for $|E|$ and SAR, with absolute SAR values remaining well below human safety limits. Graphene-based arrays produced negligible effects on RF transmission and SAR deposition.

A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments.

Here, we describe Bayesian brain mapping (BBM), a technique for individual functional topography and connectivity leveraging population information. Population-derived priors for both spatial topography and functional connectivity based on existing spatial templates, such as parcellations or continuous network maps, are used to guide subject-level estimation and combat noise. BBM is highly flexible, avoiding strong spatial or temporal constraints and allowing for overlap between networks and heterogeneous patterns of engagement. Unlike multi-subject hierarchical models, BBM is designed for single-subject analysis, making it highly computationally efficient and translatable to clinical settings.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in fMRI-based image reconstruction have achieved remarkable photo-realistic fidelity. Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas.",

      "abstract": "Brain foundation models bring the foundation model paradigm to the field of neuroscience. Like language and image foundation models, they are general-purpose AI systems pretrained on large-scale datasets that adapt readily to downstream tasks. Unlike text-and-image based models, however, they train on brain data: large-datasets of EEG, fMRI, and other neural data types historically collected within tightly governed clinical and research settings. This paper contends that training foundation models on neural data opens new normative territory. Neural data carry stronger expectations of, and claims to, protection than text or images, given their body-derived nature and historical governance within clinical and research settings. Yet the foundation model paradigm subjects them to practices of large-scale repurposing, cross-context stitching, and open-ended downstream application. Furthermore, these practices are now accessible to a much broader range of actors, including commercial developers, against a backdrop of fragmented and unclear governance. To map this territory, we first describe brain foundation models' technical foundations and training-data ecosystem. We then draw on AI ethics, neuroethics, and bioethics to organize concerns across privacy, consent, bias, benefit sharing, and governance. For each, we propose both agenda-setting questions and baseline safeguards as the field matures.",

      "abstract": "A desirable property of any deployed artificial intelligence is generalization across domains, i.e. data generation distribution under a specific acquisition condition. In medical imagining applications the most coveted property for effective deployment is Single Domain Generalization (SDG), which addresses the challenge of training a model on a single domain to ensure it generalizes well to unseen target domains. In multi-center studies, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare class characteristics. This paper presents our experience on SDG in real life deployment for two exemplary medical imaging case studies on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, and stress electrocardiogram based coronary artery detection. Utilizing the commonly used application of diabetic retinopathy, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art SDG techniques fail to achieve generalized performance across data domains. We then develop a generic expert knowledge integrated deep learning technique DL+EKE and instantiate it for the DR application and show that DL+EKE outperforms SOTA SDG methods on DR. We then deploy instances of DL+EKE technique on the two real world examples of stress ECG and resting state (rs)-fMRI and discuss issues faced with SDG techniques.",

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context.

Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding.

The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors.

I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.",

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

      "abstract": "Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

      "abstract": "A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.",

      "abstract": "The establishment of the UK National Health Service (NHS) in July 1948 was one of the most consequential health policy interventions of the twentieth century, providing universal and free access to medical care and substantially expanding maternal and infant health services. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of the NHS introduction on early-life mortality and we test whether survival is selective. We adopt a regression discontinuity design under local randomization, comparing individuals born just before and just after July 1948. Leveraging newly digitized weekly death records, we document a significant decline in stillbirths and infant mortality following the introduction of the NHS, the latter driven primarily by reductions in deaths from congenital conditions and diarrhea. We then use polygenic indexes (PGIs), fixed at conception, to track changes in population composition, showing that cohorts born at or after the NHS introduction exhibit higher PGIs associated with contextually-adverse traits (e.g., depression, COPD, and preterm birth) and lower PGIs associated with contextually-valued traits (e.g., educational attainment, self-rated health, and pregnancy length), with effect sizes as large as 7.5% of a standard deviation. These results based on the UK Biobank data are robust to family-based designs and replicate in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Effects are strongest in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and among males. This novel evidence on the existence and magnitude of selective survival highlights how large-scale public policies can leave a persistent imprint on population composition and generate long-term survival biases.",

As a result it has broad applications across areas such as energy materials, catalysis, environmental science and biological samples. However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan.",

      "abstract": "Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861).

Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.",

This study aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid electromagnetic (EM) simulation framework for efficient and accurate assessment of such interactions. Methods: A hybrid EM strategy integrating the Huygens' Box (HB) method with sub-gridding was implemented in an FDTD solver (Sim4Life). RF coil models for mouse and rat head were simulated with and without intracortical (IC) and epicortical (EC) graphene-based micro-transistor arrays. Three-dimensional multi-layered probe models were reconstructed from two-dimensional layouts, and transmit field ($B_{1}^{+}$), electric field ($E$), and specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions were evaluated. Performance was benchmarked against conventional full-wave multi-port (MP) simulations using Bland-Altman analysis and voxel-wise percentage differences. Results: HB simulations reduced computational time by approximately 70-80%, while preserving spatial patterns of $|B_{1}^{+}|$, $|E|$, and SAR, including transmit-field symmetry and localized high-field regions. Deviations from MP were minimal for $|B_{1}^{+}|$ (median $\u0394$% 0.02-0.07% in mice, -3.7% to -1.7% in rats) and modest for $|E|$ and SAR, with absolute SAR values remaining well below human safety limits. Graphene-based arrays produced negligible effects on RF transmission and SAR deposition. Conclusion: The HB approach enables computationally efficient, high-resolution evaluation of EM interactions involving microscopic probes in MRI environments, supporting simulations that are otherwise impractical with full-wave MP modeling.",

Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Here, we describe a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) designed for rapid extraction of voxelwise multi-parameter posterior distributions. Our approach integrates a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning, and provides a full covariance that captures the inter-parameter correlations of the latent biophysical space. The method was validated in a multi-proton pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) molecular MRF study, across in-vitro phantoms, tumor-bearing mice, healthy human volunteers, and a subject with glioblastoma. The resulting multi-parametric posteriors are in good agreement with those calculated using a brute-force Bayesian analysis, while providing an orders-of-magnitude acceleration in whole brain quantification. In addition, we demonstrate how monitoring the multi-parameter posterior dynamics across progressively acquired signals provides practical insights for protocol optimization and may facilitate real-time adaptive acquisition.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection stands as an important problem in machine learning, with applications in financial fraud prevention, network security and medical diagnostics. Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection.",
