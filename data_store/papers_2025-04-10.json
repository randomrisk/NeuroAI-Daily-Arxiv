      "abstract": "Prolonged alcohol use results in neuroadaptations that mark more severe and treatment-resistant alcohol use. The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings demonstrate the utility of combining theory- and data-driven approaches to uncover associations between resting-state functional substrates and AUD-related characteristics that could aid in the identification, development, and testing of novel treatment targets across preclinical and clinical models."

      "abstract": "Neuromorphic engineering is an emerging research domain that aims to realize important implementation advantages that brain-inspired technologies can offer over classical digital technologies, including energy efficiency, adaptability, and robustness. For the field of systems and control, neuromorphic controllers could potentially bring many benefits, but their advancement is hampered by lack of systematic analysis and design tools. In this paper, the objective is to show that hybrid systems methods can aid in filling this gap. We do this by formally analyzing rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum system, which was recently proposed as a prototypical setup. The neuromorphic controller generates spikes, which we model as a Dirac delta pulse, whenever the pendulum angular position crosses its resting position, with the goal of inducing a stable limit cycle. This leads to modeling the closed-loop system as a hybrid dynamical system, which in between spikes evolves in open loop and where the jumps correspond to the spiking control actions. Exploiting the hybrid system model, we formally prove the existence, uniqueness, and a stability property of the hybrid limit cycle for the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations illustrate our approach. We finally elaborate on a possible spiking adaptation mechanism on the pulse amplitude to generate a hybrid limit cycle of a desired maximal angular amplitude."

The model problem is reformulated using an entropy variable to guarantee solution positivity, boundedness, and satisfaction of a discrete entropy-stability inequality at the numerical level. The scheme combines a local discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal meshes for the space discretization with a $\\nu$-step backward differentiation formula for the time integration. Implementation details are discussed, including a detailed derivation of the linear systems arising from Newton's iteration. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through extensive numerical tests. Finally, the method's practical performance is demonstrated through simulations of \\textalpha{}-synuclein propagation in a two-dimensional brain geometry segmented from MRI data, providing a relevant computational framework for modeling synucleopathies (such as Parkinson's disease) and, more generally, neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "Cognitive functions in current artificial intelligence networks are tied to the exponential increase in network scale, whereas the human brain can continuously learn hundreds of cognitive functions with remarkably low energy consumption. This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain's developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities."

      "abstract": "Inter-brain synchronization (IBS), the alignment of neural activities between individuals, is a fundamental mechanism underlying effective social interactions and communication. Prior research has demonstrated that IBS can occur during collaborative tasks and is deeply connected to communication effectiveness. Building on these findings, recent investigations reveal that IBS happens during remote interactions, implying that brain activities between individuals can synchronize despite latency and physical separation. However, the conditions under which this synchronization occurs or is disrupted in remote settings, especially the effect of latency, are not fully understood. This study investigates how varying transmission latency affects IBS, in order to identify thresholds where synchronization is disrupted. Using electroencephalography measurements quantified through Phase Locking Value -- a metric that captures synchronization between brainwave phases -- we first confirm synchronization under face-to-face conditions and then observe changes in IBS across remote communication scenarios. Our findings reveal that IBS can occur during remote collaboration, but is critically dependent on transmission delays, with delays exceeding 450 ms significantly disrupting synchronization. These findings suggest that IBS may serve as a key indicator of communication quality in remote interactions, offering insights for improving remote communication systems and collaboration."

Although previously employed in non-invasive, the utility of Riemannian geometry for invasive datasets, which are typically smaller and scarcer, remains less explored. Here, we propose a Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier using a Riemannian geometry approach based on covariance matrices extracted from intracortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings across various regions during different brain state dynamics. For benchmarking, we evaluated the performance of our approach against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Euclidean MDM classifiers. Our results indicate that the Riemannian geometry-based classification not only achieves a superior mean F1 macro-averaged score across different channel configurations but also requires up to two orders of magnitude less computational training time. Additionally, the geometric framework reveals distinct spatial contributions of brain regions across varying brain states, suggesting a state-dependent organization that traditional time series-based methods often fail to capture. Our findings align with previous studies supporting the efficacy of geometry-based methods and extending their application to invasive brain recordings, highlighting their potential for broader clinical use, such as brain computer interface applications."

      "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning."

      "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as 'normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

Take the example of spoken language, which is characterised by a highly variable and complex set of physical movements that map onto the small set of cognitive units that comprise language. What are the fundamental dynamical principles behind the movements that structure speech production? In this study, we discover models in the form of symbolic equations that govern articulatory gestures during speech. A sparse symbolic regression algorithm is used to discover models from kinematic data on the tongue and lips. We explore these candidate models using analytical techniques and numerical simulations, and find that a second-order linear model achieves high levels of accuracy, but a nonlinear force is required to properly model articulatory dynamics in approximately one third of cases. This supports the proposal that an autonomous, nonlinear, second-order differential equation is a viable dynamical law for articulatory gestures in speech. We conclude by identifying future opportunities and obstacles in data-driven model discovery and outline prospects for discovering the dynamical principles that govern language, brain and behaviour."

This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including those with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data. To improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and accountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level explanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches. These methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions. However, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity inherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks, and the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In this study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain state-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor segmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable insights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We demonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR, while Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley distribution."

Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD is critical for effective intervention and management. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a non-invasive and efficient tool for ADHD detection due to their high temporal resolution and ability to capture neural dynamics. In this study, we propose a method for classifying ADHD and healthy children using EEG data from the benchmark dataset. There were 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy children, both boys and girls, aged 7 to 12. The EEG signals, recorded from 19 channels, were processed to extract Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Spectral Entropy (SE) features across five frequency bands, resulting in a comprehensive 190-dimensional feature set. To evaluate the classification performance, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF kernel demonstrated the best performance with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 99.2\\% and a standard deviation of 0.0079, indicating high robustness and precision. These results highlight the potential of spatial features in conjunction with machine learning for accurately classifying ADHD using EEG data. This work contributes to developing non-invasive, data-driven tools for early diagnosis and assessment of ADHD in children."

      "abstract": "The brain's bottom-up loop for processing speech influx involves both the selective attention and the encoding of specific speech information. Previous human studies have found that such attention can be represented by the cortical gamma-rhythm oscillations. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this issue, this paper proposes a neural network model that incorporates speech signal input, the cochlea, the thalamus, and a balanced excitatory-inhibitory cortical neural network, with the aim of connecting real speech signals to brain cortical responses. Using this model, we explored neural oscillation patterns in response to mixed speech stimuli and background noise. The findings revealed that the peak of gamma oscillation decreased as the frequency of the pure-tone stimuli diminished. This suggests a strong correlation and coding role of gamma oscillation peaks in auditory attention. Similar results were confirmed by analyzing the rhythmic oscillations of EEG data in response to pure-tone signals. Further results indicated that dynamic gamma oscillations are involved in the encoding capacity of continuous speech input. The coding entropy of the dynamic series was found to be proportional to the complexity of the content. This suggests that gamma oscillations play multiple roles, not only in sustaining the bottom-up attentional state but also in potentially conveying specific information from external speech inputs. Finally, we found that enhancing the excitatory-inhibitory balance level properly could improve auditory attention. This finding provides a potential endogenous explanation for the dynamic switching process of brain attention in processing auditory signals."

CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates."

Specifically, it is unknown whether ASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a shorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity patterns.   Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from 28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure occurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns (states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these to different ASM levels.   Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p < 0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:   Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering unmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these 'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).   Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without taper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224% longer durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p < 0.001).   Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress specific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and (ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight the complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized dosing strategies for epilepsy management. These findings may also have implications in understanding the effects of ASMs on cognition and mood.",

Another issue is that the time-evolving statistical properties of nonstationary signals prevent the use of standard data augmentation techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel method for augmenting nonstationary time series. This is achieved by combining offline changepoint detection with the iterative amplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (iAAFT), which ensures that the time-frequency properties of the original signal are preserved during augmentation.

To further improve decoding accuracy, we introduce a Hybrid Temporal-Spectral Reward (HTSR) loss function, which combines time-domain, frequency-domain, and reward-based loss components. Moreover, we contribute a new Gait-EEG Dataset (GED), consisting of synchronized EEG and lower-limb joint angle data collected from 50 participants over two lab visits. Validation experiments on both the GED and the publicly available Mobile Brain-body imaging (MoBI) dataset demonstrate that EEG2GAIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best joint angle prediction. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the hierarchical GCN modules and HTSR Loss, while saliency maps reveal the significance of motor-related brain regions in decoding tasks. These findings underscore EEG2GAIT's potential for advancing brain-computer interface applications, particularly in lower-limb rehabilitation and assistive technologies."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that is one of the most common forms of dementia. It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals."

      "abstract": "Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining serves as a valuable technique for detecting specific antigens or proteins through antibody-mediated visualization. However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis."

However, EEG-based emotion recognition models face challenges in cross-domain applications due to the high cost of labeled data and variations in EEG signals from individual differences and recording conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation methods typically require access to source domain data, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios due to privacy and computational constraints. Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SF-UDA) has recently emerged as a solution, enabling target domain adaptation without source data, but its application in emotion recognition remains unexplored. We propose a novel SF-UDA approach for EEG-based emotion classification across domains, introducing a multi-stage framework that enhances model adaptability without requiring source data. Our approach incorporates Dual-Loss Adaptive Regularization (DLAR) to minimize prediction discrepancies on confident samples and align predictions with expected pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce Localized Consistency Learning (LCL), which enforces local consistency by promoting similar predictions from reliable neighbors. These techniques together address domain shift and reduce the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, a key challenge in traditional SF-UDA models. Experiments on two widely used datasets, DEAP and SEED, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 65.84% accuracy when trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, and 58.99% accuracy in the reverse scenario. It excels at detecting both positive and negative emotions, making it well-suited for practical emotion recognition applications."

In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI."

To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression."

Despite their benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on neurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In this context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt spontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition. Previous work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced number of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this limitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of the primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons, tested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting gratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus, also testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results, based on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the attacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and fixed events are the most robust. Although both attacks can significantly affect neural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal delays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many neurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO increased with the number of neurons attacked.",

To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.",

To address these issues, we propose BOLDSimNet, a novel framework utilizing Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) to measure causal connectivity and network similarity across different cognitive states. Our method groups functionally similar regions of interest (ROIs) rather than spatially adjacent nodes, improving accuracy in network alignment.

We address this gap by comparing word representations from contrastive multimodal models vs. language-only ones in the extent to which they capture experiential information -- as defined by an existing norm-based 'experiential model' -- and align with human fMRI responses. Our results indicate that, surprisingly, language-only models are superior to multimodal ones in both respects.

However, conventional neuroimaging models are constrained by linear and stationary assumptions, limiting their ability to capture these processes. Transformer-based architectures, known for capturing long-range dependencies, align well with the brain's hierarchical and temporal organization. We introduce Multi-Band Brain Net (MBBN), a transformer-based framework that models frequency-specific spatiotemporal brain dynamics from fMRI by integrating scale-free network principles with frequency-resolved multi-band self-attention. Trained on three large-scale neuroimaging cohorts (UK Biobank, ABCD, ABIDE) totaling 45,951 individuals, MBBN reveals previously undetectable frequency-dependent network interactions, shedding light on connectivity disruptions in psychiatric conditions (ADHD, ASD, depression). This validation shows robust generalizability and highlights core neural principles conserved across populations. MBBN achieves up to 30.59% higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the advantage of frequency-informed spatiotemporal modeling in capturing latent neural computations. MBBN's interpretability uncovers novel frequency-specific biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders, providing insights into the hierarchical organization of brain function. By offering an interpretable framework for spatiotemporal learning, MBBN provides insights into how neural computations underpin cognitive function and psychiatric vulnerability, with implications for brain decoding, cognitive neuroscience, and precision psychiatry.",

In this work, we propose NeuroLIP, a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework. We introduce text token-conditioned attention (TTCA) and cross-modal alignment via localized tokens (CALT) to the brain region-level embeddings with each disease-related phenotypic token. It improves interpretability via token-level attention maps, revealing brain region-disease associations. To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance. Qualitative visualization of attention maps highlights neuroanatomical patterns aligned with diagnostic characteristics, validated by the neuroscientific literature.

      "abstract": "This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for classifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes."

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training without direct data sharing. Model-heterogeneous FL (MHFL) extends this paradigm by allowing clients to train personalized models with heterogeneous architectures tailored to their computational resources and application-specific needs. However, existing MHFL methods predominantly rely on centralized aggregation, which introduces scalability and efficiency bottlenecks, or impose restrictions requiring partially identical model architectures across clients. While peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes server dependence, it suffers from model drift and knowledge dilution, limiting its effectiveness in heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedSKD, a novel MHFL framework that facilitates direct knowledge exchange through round-robin model circulation, eliminating the need for centralized aggregation while allowing fully heterogeneous model architectures across clients. FedSKD's key innovation lies in multi-dimensional similarity knowledge distillation, which enables bidirectional cross-client knowledge transfer at batch, pixel/voxel, and region levels for heterogeneous models in FL. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and model drift through progressive reinforcement and distribution alignment while preserving model heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on fMRI-based autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and skin lesion classification demonstrate that FedSKD outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous FL baselines, achieving superior personalization (client-specific accuracy) and generalization (cross-institutional adaptability). These findings underscore FedSKD's potential as a scalable and robust solution for real-world medical federated learning applications."

As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness.

We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing."

However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments."

For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

      "abstract": "How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond."

      "abstract": "High-resolution segmentation is critical for precise disease diagnosis by extracting micro-imaging information from medical images. Existing transformer-based encoder-decoder frameworks have demonstrated remarkable versatility and zero-shot performance in medical segmentation. While beneficial, they usually require huge memory costs when handling large-size segmentation mask predictions, which are expensive to apply to real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a memory-efficient framework for high-resolution medical image segmentation, called HRMedSeg. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight gated vision transformer (LGViT) as our image encoder to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. Then, we design an efficient cross-multiscale decoder (ECM-Decoder) to generate high-resolution segmentation masks. Moreover, we utilize feature distillation during pretraining to unleash the potential of our proposed model. Extensive experiments reveal that HRMedSeg outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse high-resolution medical image segmentation tasks. In particular, HRMedSeg uses only 0.59GB GPU memory per batch during fine-tuning, demonstrating low training costs. Besides, when HRMedSeg meets the Segment Anything Model (SAM), our HRMedSegSAM takes 0.61% parameters of SAM-H. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/HRMedSeg.",

Linear regression was applied to 80 principal components extracted from each spectrum, and model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation, simulating real-world biosensing scenarios where unknown patient samples are predicted based on standard calibration data. Titanium-based structures, dominated by broadband intensity changes, yielded the lowest mean squared errors and the highest accuracy improvements: up to a 6065-fold reduction compared to the best single-feature model. In contrast, silicon-based structures, governed by narrow resonances, showed more modest gains due to spectral nonlinearity that limits the effectiveness of global linear models. We also show that even the best single-wavelength predictor is identified through data-driven analysis, not visual selection, highlighting the value of automated feature preselection. These findings demonstrate that spectral shape plays a key role in modeling performance and that full-spectrum linear approaches are especially effective for intensity-modulated index sensors."

Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validationto minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates, and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the best models based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best. Size retrieval accuracy was similar across models, and predictions closely matched expert annotations. Finally, we demonstrate how our AI-driven wound size estimation framework, WoundAmbit, can be integrated into a custom telehealth system. Our code will be made available on GitHub upon publication."

Social determinants of health (SDOH) are domains such as health care access, dietary access, and economics frequently studied for potential association with health disparities. Evaluating SDOH-related phenotypes using routine medical images as data sources may enhance health disparities research. We developed a pipeline for using quantitative measures automatically extracted from medical images as inputs into health disparities index calculations. Our study focused on the use case of two SDOH demographic correlates (sex and race) and data extracted from chest radiographs of 1,571 unique patients. The likelihood of severe disease within the lung parenchyma from each image type, measured using an established deep learning model, was merged into a single numerical image-based phenotype for each patient. Patients were then separated into phenogroups by unsupervised clustering of the image-based phenotypes. The health rate for each phenogroup was defined as the median image-based phenotype for each SDOH used as inputs to four imaging-derived health disparities indices (iHDIs): one absolute measure (between-group variance) and three relative measures (index of disparity, Theil index, and mean log deviation). The iHDI measures demonstrated feasible values for each SDOH demographic correlate, showing potential for medical images to serve as a novel probe for health disparities. Large-scale AI analysis of medical images can serve as a probe for a novel data source for health disparities research."

However, the current technology still has problems like insufficient sensitivity and limited durability, which hinder its wide application. This paper presents a highly sensitive, modular, and flexible capacitive sensor based on line-shaped electrodes and liquid metal (EGaIn), integrated into a sensor module tailored to the human hand's anatomy. The proposed system independently captures bending information from each finger joint, while additional measurements between adjacent fingers enable the recording of subtle variations in inter-finger spacing. This design enables accurate gesture recognition and dynamic hand morphological reconstruction of complex movements using point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our classifier based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an accuracy of 99.15% across 30 gestures. Meanwhile, a transformer-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) accurately reconstructs dynamic hand shapes with an Average Distance (AD) of 2.076\\pm3.231 mm, with the reconstruction accuracy at individual key points surpassing SOTA benchmarks by 9.7% to 64.9%.

Capturing this uncertainty is an important goal and previous works have used various generative image models for the purpose of representing the full distribution of plausible expert ground truths. In this work, we explore the design space of diffusion models for generative segmentation, investigating the impact of noise schedules, prediction types, and loss weightings. Notably, we find that making the noise schedule harder with input scaling significantly improves performance. We conclude that x- and v-prediction outperform epsilon-prediction, likely because the diffusion process is in the discrete segmentation domain. Many loss weightings achieve similar performance as long as they give enough weight to the end of the diffusion process. We base our experiments on the LIDC-IDRI lung lesion dataset and obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, we introduce a randomly cropped variant of the LIDC-IDRI dataset that is better suited for uncertainty in image segmentation. Our model also achieves SOTA in this harder setting."

      "abstract": "Automatic view positioning is crucial for cardiac computed tomography (CT) examinations, including disease diagnosis and surgical planning. However, it is highly challenging due to individual variability and large 3D search space. Existing work needs labor-intensive and time-consuming manual annotations to train view-specific models, which are limited to predicting only a fixed set of planes. However, in real clinical scenarios, the challenge of positioning semantic 2D slices with any orientation into varying coordinate space in arbitrary 3D volume remains unsolved. We thus introduce a novel framework, AVP-AP, the first to use Atlas Prompting for self-supervised Automatic View Positioning in the 3D CT volume. Specifically, this paper first proposes an atlas prompting method, which generates a 3D canonical atlas and trains a network to map slices into their corresponding positions in the atlas space via a self-supervised manner. Then, guided by atlas prompts corresponding to the given query images in a reference CT, we identify the coarse positions of slices in the target CT volume using rigid transformation between the 3D atlas and target CT volume, effectively reducing the search space. Finally, we refine the coarse positions by maximizing the similarity between the predicted slices and the query images in the feature space of a given foundation model. Our framework is flexible and efficient compared to other methods, outperforming other methods by 19.8% average structural similarity (SSIM) in arbitrary view positioning and achieving 9% SSIM in two-chamber view compared to four radiologists. Meanwhile, experiments on a public dataset validate our framework's generalizability."

This study evaluates automatic Knowledge-Driven Feature Engineering (aKDFE) for improved ADE prediction from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, comparing it with automated event-based Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We investigated how incorporating domain-specific ADE risk scores for prolonged heart QT interval, extracted from the Janusmed Riskprofile (Janusmed) Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), affects prediction performance using EHR data and medication handling events. Results indicate that, while aKDFE step 1 (event-based feature generation) alone did not significantly improve ADE prediction performance, aKDFE step 2 (patient-centric transformation) enhances the prediction performance. High Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) values suggest strong feature correlations to the outcome, aligning with the predictive power of patients' prior healthcare history for ADEs. Statistical analysis did not confirm that incorporating the Janusmed information (i) risk scores and (ii) medication route of administration into the model's feature set enhanced predictive performance. However, the patient-centric transformation applied by aKDFE proved to be a highly effective feature engineering approach. Limitations include a single-project focus, potential bias from machine learning pipeline methods, and reliance on AUROC. In conclusion, aKDFE, particularly with patient-centric transformation, improves ADE prediction from EHR data. Future work will explore attention-based models, event feature sequences, and automatic methods for incorporating domain knowledge into the aKDFE framework."
