      "abstract": "Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and adapt to complex AI systems.",

      "abstract": "Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.",

While these methods achieve fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data. Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios. Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve clinical imaging workflows.",

Through experiments and micromagnetic simulations, we show how tuning the feature size, material composition, and chiral interaction strength controls the speed of self-driven domain wall motion. When integrated with spin-orbit torque, this control gives rise to behaviors essential for neuromorphic computing, including leaky integration and passive resetting of artificial neuron potential. These results establish locally engineered ferrimagnets as a tunable, scalable, and straightforward platform for domain wall-based computing architectures.",

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.",

Accurate assessment of the CoW is important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler (TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature, affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD. In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO) network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of 0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame inference speed of 14.199 ms.

Accumulating evidence however indicates that spontaneous eye blinks are not necessarily random, and can be modulated by attention and cognition beyond just physiological necessities. In this exploratory analysis we reanalyze a public EEG dataset of musicians listening to or imagining music (Bach chorales) while simultaneously reading from a sheet of music. We ask whether blink timing in reading music, accompanied by listening or imagery, is sufficient to uniquely identify the music being read from a given score. Intra-subject blink counts and timing are compared across trials using a spike train distance metric (Victor and Purpura, 1997). One-trial-left-out cross-validation is used to identify the music being read with above chance level accuracy (best subject: 56\\%, chance: 25\\%), where accuracy is seen to vary with subject, condition, and a tunable cost factor for time shifts.

For this purpose, the Fourier reconstruction is efficaciously made use of after Welch's transform, which helped identify the relevant frequency components undergoing significant changes in the case of epilepsy. The temporal dynamics involved in the EEG signals and their associated variations showed a well-structured periodic pattern characterized by bi-stability and significant quantifiable structural changes during epileptic episodes. In particular, we demonstrate and quantify the precise differences in the high-frequency gamma band (40-100 Hz) present in EEG recordings from neurologically normal participants compared to those with epilepsy. The periodic modulations at two dominant frequencies around 50 Hz and 76 Hz in power spectral density are isolated from high frequency noise through the use of Welch's transform, pinpointing their collective behaviors through a phase-space approach. The reconstructed signals from these restricted frequency domains revealed oscillatory motions showing a bi-stability and bi-furcations with distinct differences between normal and seizure conditions. These differences in the phase space images, when analyzed through linear regression and SVM-based machine learning models, support a classification accuracy of around 94-95% between healthy and ictal states using a publicly available EEG dataset from the University of Bonn (Germany). The partial reconstruction of the dynamics as compared to the earlier studies of the full phase space accurately pinpointed the destabilization of the collective high-frequency synchronous behavior and their precise differences in the normal and diseased conditions, avoiding the other chaotic components of the EEG signals.",

PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead.

Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration.

This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.",

      "abstract": "Conceptual design is a cognitively complex task, especially in the engineering design of products having relative motion between components. Designers prefer sketching as a medium for conceptual design and use gestures and annotations to represent such relative motion. Literature suggests that static representations of motion in sketches may not achieve the intended functionality when realised, because it primarily depends on the designers' mental capabilities for motion simulation. Thus, it is important to understand the cognitive phenomena when designers are exploring concepts of articulated products. The current work is an attempt to understand design neurocognition by categorising the tasks and measuring the mental effort involved in these tasks using EEG. The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to support the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based metric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to quantify mental effort. A design experiment is conducted with 32 participants, where they have to perform one control task and 2 focus tasks corresponding to the motion exploration task (MET) and the concept generation task (CGT), respectively. EEG data is recorded during the 3 tasks, cleaned, processed and analysed using the MNE library in Python. It is observed from the results that inter-BRPD captures the essence of mental effort with half the number of conventionally used parameters. The reliability and efficacy of the inter-BRPD metric are also statistically validated against literature-based cognitive metrics. With these new insights, the study opens up possibilities for creating support for conceptual design and its evaluation.",

      "abstract": "While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases. In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.",

In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG + eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time monitoring.

Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner. Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence estimation methods.

We demonstrate that an individual with tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group.

PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration.

We tested EDAPT across nine datasets covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade hardware.

Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models.

      "abstract": "Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.",

Due to the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, standard approaches often average signals within regions of interest (ROIs), which ignores the underlying spatiotemporal dependence among voxels and can lead to biased or inefficient inference. We propose to use a summary statistic -- the empirical voxel-wise correlations between ROIs -- and, crucially, model the complex covariance structure among these correlations through a new positive definite covariance function. Building on this foundation, we develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that enables statistical inference on covariate effects on region-level connectivity. Simulation studies show calibrated uncertainty quantification, and substantial gains in validity of the statistical inference over the standard averaging method. With data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we show that autism spectrum disorder is associated with altered FC between attention-related ROIs after adjusting for age and gender. The proposed framework offers an interpretable and statistically rigorous approach to estimation of covariate effects on FC suitable for large-scale neuroimaging studies.",

The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out out-of-distribution (OOD) set.

This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability.

This issue negates some of the complementary qualities of these two recording methods. In addition, typical electrical components required for electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, a common method for evoking specific brain responses, are also observed to have a detrimental influence on ultra-low MEG noise performance. These effects are caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and typically preclude single-trial detection.

We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions. This turbulence-based framework offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting large-scale brain activity, including state transitions and seizure dynamics.",

Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.",

However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.",

Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation.

Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks.

Design: Calibration offsets were simulated from a Gaussian distribution. Two prediction models - a Bayesian regression model and a nearest neighbor model - were trained on CLS-derived parameters and data from the Oldenburg Hearing Health Repository (OHHR). CLS was chosen because it provides level-independent measures (e.g., dynamic range) that remain robust despite calibration errors. Study Sample: The dataset comprised CLS results from N = 847 participants with a mean age of 70.0 years (SD = 8.7), including 556 male and 291 female listeners with diverse hearing profiles. Results: The Bayesian regression model achieved correlations of up to 0.81 between estimated and true calibration offsets, enabling accurate individual-level correction. Compared to threshold-based approaches, calibration uncertainty was reduced by factors between 0.41 and 0.79, demonstrating greater robustness in uncontrolled environments. Conclusions: CLS-based models can effectively compensate for missing calibration in mobile hearing assessments. This approach provides a practical alternative to threshold-based methods, supporting the use of smartphone-based tests outside laboratory settings and expanding access to reliable hearing healthcare in everyday and resource-limited contexts.",

TS+TT achieves two forms of balance: (1) stratified sampling ensures that allowable covariates are balanced across social groups to enable an ethically interpretable disparity contrast; (2) intervention-randomization within social groups balances both allowable and non-allowable covariates across intervention arms within each group to support unconfounded estimation of intervention effects on disparity. We describe the key components of protocol specification and its emulation and demonstrate the approach using electronic medical record data to evaluate how hypothetical interventions on pulse oximeter racial bias affect disparities in treatment receipt in clinical care. We also extend semiparametric G-computation for time-to-event outcomes in continuous time to accommodate continuous, stochastic interventions, allowing counterfactual estimation of disparities in time-to-treatment.

BioSonix, a physics-informed design framework, utilizes tissue displacements in 3D space to compute excitation forces for a sound model encoding tissue properties such as stiffness and density. Biomechanical simulations were employed to model particle displacements resulting from tool-tissue interactions, establishing a robust foundation for the method. An optimization approach was used to define configurations for capturing diverse interaction scenarios with varying tool trajectories. Experiments were conducted to validate the accuracy of the sound-displacement mappings. Additionally, two user studies were performed: the first involved two clinical professionals (a neuroradiologist and a cardiologist), who confirmed the method's impact and achieved high task accuracy; the second included 22 biomedical experts, who demonstrated high discrimination accuracy in tissue differentiation and targeting tasks.

This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using Poincar\\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.   Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\\'e embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.   Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\\'e embeddings resulted in modest and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models, particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\\'e embedding, showed enhanced calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across configurations.   Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical terminologies used for prediction.

      "abstract": "The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge, particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant features (\"missingness\"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline choices.",

The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization results.

An innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data. Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios. Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve clinical imaging workflows.",
