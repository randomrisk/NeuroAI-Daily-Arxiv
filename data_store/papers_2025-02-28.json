      "abstract": "Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for providing complementary information about brain anatomy and pathology, leading to more accurate diagnoses. However, obtaining high-quality multi-modal MRI in a clinical setting is difficult due to factors such as time constraints, high costs, and patient movement artifacts. To overcome this difficulty, there is increasing interest in developing generative models that can synthesize missing target modality images from the available source ones. Therefore, we design a generative model for missing MRI that integrates multi-modal contrastive learning with a focus on critical tumor regions. Specifically, we integrate multi-modal contrastive learning, tailored for multiple source modalities, and enhance its effectiveness by selecting features based on entropy during the contrastive learning process. Additionally, our network not only generates the missing target modality images but also predicts segmentation outputs, simultaneously. This approach improves the generator's capability to precisely generate tumor regions, ultimately improving performance in downstream segmentation tasks. By leveraging a combination of contrastive, segmentation, and additional self-representation losses, our model effectively reflects target-specific information and generate high-quality target images. Consequently, our results in the Brain MR Image Synthesis challenge demonstrate that the proposed model excelled in generating the missing modality."

In robotics research, interacting with the physical world is crucial as it allows robots to manipulate objects in various real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulties in establishing stable force or geometric constraints.   Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using with flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By changing the position and orientation of these surfaces, objects can be translated, rotated and even flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasp, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels, even enabling the manipulation the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems."

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder impacting social and behavioral development. Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning."

To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems."

Introducing an efficient ZTE sequence for functional brain mapping can help address limitations of EPI and demonstrate the feasibility of using T1 related changes as a surrogate marker of brain activity. Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution."

Our key insight is that LLM activations exhibit two complementary patterns: 1) \\textit{Global statistical sparsity} driven by sequence-level prefix information, and 2) \\textit{Local semantic adaptability} modulated by cognitive load metrics(e.g., surprisal and entropy). CLADA employs a hierarchical thresholding strategy: a baseline from offline error-controlled optimization ensures 40\\%+ sparsity, dynamically adjusted by real-time cognitive signals. Evaluations across six mainstream LLMs and nine benchmarks demonstrate that CLADA achieves \\textbf{~20\\% average speedup with <2\\% accuracy drop}, outperforming Griffin (5\\%+ degradation) and TT (negligible speedup). Crucially, we establish the first formal connection between neurolinguistic event-related potential (ERP) components and LLM efficiency mechanisms through multi-level regression analysis ($R^2=0.17$ for sparsity-adaptation synergy).

Inspired by the brain's mechanisms for categorization and analogical learning, we propose a novel approach called Brain-inspired Analogical Mixture Prototypes (BAMP). BAMP has three components: mixed prototypical feature learning, statistical analogy, and soft voting. Starting from a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT), mixed prototypical feature learning represents each class using a mixture of prototypes and fine-tunes these representations during the base session. The statistical analogy calibrates the mean and covariance matrix of prototypes for new classes according to similarity to the base classes, and computes classification score with Mahalanobis distance. Soft voting combines both merits of statistical analogy and an off-shelf FSCIL method. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BAMP outperforms state-of-the-art on both traditional big start FSCIL setting and challenging small start FSCIL setting. The study suggests that brain-inspired analogical mixture prototypes can alleviate catastrophic forgetting and over-fitting problems in FSCIL."

Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness."

The variability in EEG data across individuals poses a significant barrier to the development of effective and widely applicable aBCI models. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel transfer learning framework called Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Distribution Alignment (SDA-DDA). This approach aligns the marginal and conditional probability distribution of source and target domains using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD). We introduce a dynamic distribution alignment mechanism to adjust differences throughout training and enhance adaptation. Additionally, a pseudo-label confidence filtering module is integrated into the semi-supervised process to refine pseudo-label generation and improve the estimation of conditional distributions. Extensive experiments on EEG benchmark databases (SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP) validate the robustness and effectiveness of SDA-DDA. The results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in emotion recognition across various scenarios, including cross-subject and cross-session conditions.

In contrast, we hypothesize that critical time-frequency features can be effectively captured from a single channel. By learning tokens that encapsulate these intrinsic patterns within a single channel, our approach yields a scalable tokenizer adaptable across diverse EEG settings. We integrate the TFM-Tokenizer with a transformer-based TFM-Encoder, leveraging established pretraining techniques from natural language processing, such as masked token prediction, followed by downstream fine-tuning for various EEG tasks. Experiments across four EEG datasets show that TFM-Token outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On TUEV, our approach improves balanced accuracy and Cohen's Kappa by 5% over baselines. Comprehensive analysis of the learned tokens demonstrates their ability to capture class-distinctive features, enhance frequency representation, and ability to encode time-frequency motifs into distinct tokens, improving interpretability."

      "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of parameter estimation (or identification) in dynamical networks composed of an arbitrary number of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron models with diffusive couplings between each other. It is assumed that only the membrane potential of each model is measured, while the other state variable and all derivatives remain unmeasured. Additionally, potential measurement errors in the membrane potential due to sensor imprecision are considered. To solve this problem, firstly, the original FitzHugh-Nagumo network is transformed into a linear regression model, where the regressors are obtained by applying a filter-differentiator to specific combinations of the measured variables. Secondly, the speed-gradient method is applied to this linear model, leading to the design of an identification algorithm for the FitzHugh-Nagumo neural network. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic convergence of the parameter estimates to their true values are derived for the proposed algorithm. Parameter estimation for a network of five interconnected neurons is demonstrated through computer simulation. The results confirm that the sufficient conditions are satisfied in the numerical experiments conducted. Furthermore, the algorithm's capabilities for adjusting the identification accuracy and time are investigated. The proposed approach has potential applications in nervous system modeling, particularly in the context of human brain modeling. For instance, EEG signals could serve as the measured variables of the network, enabling the integration of mathematical neural models with empirical data collected by neurophysiologists."

This paper presents a comprehensive review of traditional and Transformer-based attention mechanisms, their embedding strategies, and their applications in EEG-based BCI, with a particular emphasis on multimodal data fusion. By capturing EEG variations across time, frequency, and spatial channels, attention mechanisms improve feature extraction, representation learning, and model robustness. These methods can be broadly categorized into traditional attention mechanisms, which typically integrate with convolutional and recurrent networks, and Transformer-based multi-head self-attention, which excels in capturing long-range dependencies. Beyond single-modality analysis, attention mechanisms also enhance multimodal EEG applications, facilitating effective fusion between EEG and other physiological or sensory data. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and emerging trends in attention-based EEG modeling, highlighting future directions for advancing BCI technology. This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers seeking to leverage attention mechanisms for improved EEG interpretation and application."

Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness."

However, their quadratic computational complexity presents challenges in memory efficiency, training, and inference speed, limiting their scalability and generalizability as a foundation model. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework based on structured state space duality (SSD) that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 introduces three key innovations: (1) a reconstruction-based framework that captures both local and global EEG features through Mamba-2 structured state space models, (2) a spatiotemporal-aware loss function that enhances robustness to noise and preserves spectral information, and (3) a multi-branch receptive field input embedding strategy that improves cross-subject generalization and stability for EEG sequences of varying lengths. In comparison to traditional pretraining methods, on raw EEG or latent representation spaces, EEGM2 shows superior performance on long-sequence tasks, where conventional models struggle. Our experimental results on six EEG datasets validate that EEGM2 not only achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it a more efficient solution for deployment on resource-constrained BCI devices."

The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments."

Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/session, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 10 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency.

However, cross-subject variability remains a critical challenge, particularly for BCI-illiterate users who struggle to effectively interact with these systems. To address this issue, we propose the Class-Sensitive Subject-to-Subject Semantic Style Transfer Network (CSSSTN), which incorporates a class-sensitive approach to align feature distributions between golden subjects (BCI experts) and target (BCI-illiterate) users on a class-by-class basis. Building on the SSSTN framework, CSSSTN incorporates three key components: (1) subject-specific classifier training, (2) a unique style loss to transfer class-discriminative features while preserving semantic information through a modified content loss, and (3) an ensemble approach to integrate predictions from both source and target domains. We evaluated CSSSTN using both a publicly available dataset and a self-collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CSSSTN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean balanced accuracy improvements of 6.4\\% on the Tsinghua dataset and 3.5\\% on the HDU dataset, with notable benefits for BCI-illiterate users. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component, particularly the class-sensitive transfer and the use of lower-layer features, which enhance transfer performance and mitigate negative transfer. Additionally, CSSSTN achieves competitive results with minimal target data, reducing calibration time and effort.

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning."

Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain.

Inspired by fMRI functional localizer experiments, we presented images from different categories (faces, bodies, scenes, words, scrambled scenes, and scrambled words) to deep networks and identified category-selective neurons using statistical criteria. Comparing ResNet and the structurally controlled ResNet-based CLIP model, we found that both models contain category-selective neurons, with their proportion increasing across layers, mirroring category selectivity in higher-level visual brain regions. However, CLIP exhibited a higher proportion but lower specificity of category-selective neurons compared to ResNet. Additionally, CLIP's category-selective neurons were more evenly distributed across feature maps and demonstrated greater representational consistency across layers. These findings suggest that language learning increases the number of category-selective neurons while reducing their selectivity strength, reshaping visual representations in deep networks.

It emerges in early life and is generally associated with lifelong disabilities. Thus, accurate and early diagnosis could facilitate treatment outcomes for those with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a useful tool that measures changes in brain signaling to facilitate our understanding of ASD. Much effort is being made to identify ASD biomarkers using various connectome-based machine learning and deep learning classifiers. However, correlation-based models cannot capture the non-linear interactions between brain regions. To solve this problem, we introduce a causality-inspired deep learning model that uses time-series information from fMRI and captures causality among ROIs useful for ASD classification. The model is compared with other baseline and state-of-the-art models with 5-fold cross-validation on the ABIDE dataset. We filtered the dataset by choosing all the images with mean FD less than 15mm to ensure data quality. Our proposed model achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 71.9% and an average AUC of 75.8%. Moreover, the inter-ROI causality interpretation of the model suggests that the left precuneus, right precuneus, and cerebellum are placed in the top 10 ROIs in inter-ROI causality among the ASD population. In contrast, these ROIs are not ranked in the top 10 in the control population. We have validated our findings with the literature and found that abnormalities in these ROIs are often associated with ASD."

      "abstract": "Standard language model evaluations can fail to capture risks that emerge only at deployment scale. For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments."

Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries.

Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings."

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized.

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

      "abstract": "We present a method to shape a neutron beam and project any specified target image using a single universal patterned mask that is transversely displaced. The method relies on \"ghost projection\", which is a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. A set of sub-mask regions that combine to construct the required beam shape is computed; illumination of each region with the determined exposure time projects the shaped beam. We demonstrate this method experimentally, using the Dingo neutron imaging beamline at the OPAL nuclear research reactor (Australia). The ability to shape a neutron beam \"on demand\" allows selective dose delivery away from sensitive areas of samples, such as in cultural heritage artifacts. It also benefits irradiation techniques, e.g., in testing resilience of electronic components for space and defense technologies or neutron therapies."

This study presents a novel exploration, being the first to systematically evaluate segmentation, registration, and classification tasks across multiple imaging modalities. Integrating both classical and deep learning (DL) approaches in addressing brain MRI tissue segmentation, lung CT image registration, and skin lesion classification from dermoscopic images, we demonstrate the complementary strengths of these methodologies in diverse applications. For brain tissue segmentation, 3D DL models outperformed 2D and patch-based models, specifically nnU-Net achieving Dice of 0.9397, with 3D U-Net models on ResNet34 backbone, offering competitive results with Dice 0.8946. Multi-Atlas methods provided robust alternatives for cases where DL methods are not feasible, achieving average Dice of 0.7267. In lung CT registration, classical Elastix-based methods outperformed DL models, achieving a minimum Target Registration Error (TRE) of 6.68 mm, highlighting the effectiveness of parameter tuning. HighResNet performed best among DL models with a TRE of 7.40 mm. For skin lesion classification, ensembles of DL models like InceptionResNetV2 and ResNet50 excelled, achieving up to 90.44%, and 93.62% accuracies for binary and multiclass classification respectively. Also, adopting One-vs-All method, DL attained accuracies of 94.64% (mel vs. others), 95.35% (bcc vs. others), and 96.93% (scc vs. others), while ML models specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on handcrafted features offered interpretable alternatives with 85.04% accuracy using SMOTE for class imbalance correction on the multi-class task and 83.27% on the binary-class task.

      "abstract": "We investigate the use of quantum computing algorithms on real quantum hardware to tackle the computationally intensive task of feature selection for light-weight medical image datasets. Feature selection is often formulated as a k of n selection problem, where the complexity grows binomially with increasing k and n. As problem sizes grow, classical approaches struggle to scale efficiently. Quantum computers, particularly quantum annealers, are well-suited for such problems, offering potential advantages in specific formulations. We present a method to solve larger feature selection instances than previously presented on commercial quantum annealers. Our approach combines a linear Ising penalty mechanism with subsampling and thresholding techniques to enhance scalability. The method is tested in a toy problem where feature selection identifies pixel masks used to reconstruct small-scale medical images. The results indicate that quantum annealing-based feature selection is effective for this simplified use case, demonstrating its potential in high-dimensional optimization tasks. However, its applicability to broader, real-world problems remains uncertain, given the current limitations of quantum computing hardware."

      "abstract": "Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC."

      "abstract": "Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large language models have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process."

Introducing an efficient ZTE sequence for functional brain mapping can help address limitations of EPI and demonstrate the feasibility of using T1 related changes as a surrogate marker of brain activity. Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution."

      "abstract": "Background: Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, yet voxel-wise DL uncertainty maps are rarely presented to clinicians. Purpose: This study assessed how DL-generated uncertainty maps impact radiation oncologists during manual correction of prostate radiotherapy DL segmentations. Methods: Two nnUNet models were trained by 10-fold cross-validation on 434 MRI-only prostate cancer cases to segment the prostate and rectum. Each model was evaluated on 35 independent cases. Voxel-wise uncertainty was calculated using the SoftMax standard deviation (n=10) and visualized as a color-coded map. Four oncologists performed segmentation in two steps: Step 1: Rated segmentation quality and confidence using Likert scales and edited DL segmentations without uncertainty maps. Step 2 ($\\geq 4$ weeks later): Repeated step 1, but with uncertainty maps available. Segmentation time was recorded for both steps, and oncologists provided qualitative free-text feedback. Histogram analysis compared voxel edits across uncertainty levels. Results: DL segmentations showed high agreement with oncologist edits. Quality ratings varied: rectum segmentation ratings slightly decreased overall in step 2, while prostate ratings differed among oncologists. Confidence ratings also varied. Three oncologists reduced segmentation time with uncertainty maps, saving 1-2 minutes per case. Histogram analysis showed 50% fewer edits for step 2 in low-uncertainty areas. Conclusions: Presenting DL segmentation uncertainty information to radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality perception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Low-uncertainty regions were edited less frequently, indicating increased trust in DL predictions. Uncertainty maps improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time and can be a valuable clinical tool, enhancing radiotherapy planning efficiency."

This study introduces the \"4+ Angle Polarization\" widget, an innovative extension to the open-source Quasar platform (https://quasar.codes/), tailored for advanced multiple-angle polarization analysis. This toolbox enables precise molecular orientation analysis of complex microspectroscopic datasets through a streamlined workflow. Using polarized Fourier transform infrared (p-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate its versatility across various sample types, including polylactic acid (PLA) organic crystals, murine cortical bone, and human osteons. By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis. This novel analytical tool expands the potential of multiple-angle p-FTIR techniques into advanced characterization of structural anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, providing transformative insights for materials characterization, biomedical imaging and beyond."

AQNNs are prevalent in modern applications where, for instance, a medical professional may want to compute \"the average systolic blood pressure of patients whose predicted condition is similar to a given insomnia patient\". Since prediction typically involves an expensive deep learning model or a human expert, we formulate query processing as the problem of returning an approximate aggregate by combining an expensive oracle and a cheaper model (e.g, a simple ML model) to compute the predictions. We design the Sampler with Precision-Recall in Target (SPRinT) framework for answering AQNNs. SPRinT consists of sampling, nearest neighbor refinement, and aggregation, and is tailored for various aggregation functions. It enjoys provable theoretical guarantees, including bounds on sample size and on error in approximate aggregates. Our extensive experiments on medical, e-commerce, and video datasets demonstrate that SPRinT consistently achieves the lowest aggregation error with minimal computation cost compared to its baselines. Scalability results show that SPRinT's execution time and aggregation error remain stable as the dataset size increases, confirming its suitability for large-scale applications."

While teleoperated robots have been successfully used in high-stakes domains such as firefighting and space exploration, autonomous robots that aid highs-takes teamwork remain underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a rapid prototyping process to develop a series of seemingly autonomous robot designed to assist clinical teams in the Emergency Room. We transformed a standard crash cart--which stores medical equipment and emergency supplies into a medical robotic crash cart (MCCR). The MCCR was evaluated through field deployments to assess its impact on team workload and usability, identified taxonomies of failure, and refined the MCCR in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Our work advances the understanding of robot design for high-stakes, time-sensitive settings, providing insights into useful MCCR capabilities and considerations for effective human-robot collaboration. By publicly disseminating our MCCR tutorial, we hope to encourage HRI researchers to explore the design of robots for high-stakes teamwork."
