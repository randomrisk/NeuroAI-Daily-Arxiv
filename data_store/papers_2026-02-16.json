      "abstract": "Soft robotics has emerged as a versatile field with applications across various domains, from healthcare to industrial automation, and more recently, art and interactive installations. The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.",

      "abstract": "Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.",

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.   Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.   The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.   This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies.",

      "abstract": "When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).",

      "abstract": "Brain age has become a prominent biomarker of brain health. Yet most prior work targets whole brain age (WBA), a coarse paradigm that struggles to support tasks such as disease characterization and research on development and aging patterns, because relevant changes are typically region-selective rather than brain-wide. Therefore, robust regional brain age (ReBA) estimation is critical, yet a widely generalizable model has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose the Regional Brain Age Prediction Network (ReBA-Pred-Net), a Teacher-Student framework designed for fine-grained brain age estimation. The Teacher produces soft ReBA to guide the Student to yield reliable ReBA estimates with a clinical-prior consistency constraint (regions within the same function should change similarly). For rigorous evaluation, we introduce two indirect metrics: Healthy Control Similarity (HCS), which assesses statistical consistency by testing whether regional brain-age-gap (ReBA minus chronological age) distributions align between training and unseen HC; and Neuro Disease Correlation (NDC), which assesses factual consistency by checking whether clinically confirmed patients show elevated brain-age-gap in disease-associated regions. Experiments across multiple backbones demonstrate the statistical and factual validity of our method.",

We evaluate WaveFormer on eight diverse datasets spanning human activity recognition and brain signal analysis, with sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 3000 timesteps and channel counts from 1 to 144. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves competitive performance through comprehensive frequency-aware processing.

      "abstract": "The brain interprets visual information through learned regularities, a computation formalized as probabilistic inference under a prior. The visual cortex establishes priors for this inference, some delivered through established top-down connections that inform low-level cortices about statistics represented at higher levels in the cortical hierarchy. While evidence shows that adaptation leads to priors reflecting the structure of natural images, it remains unclear whether similar priors can be flexibly acquired when learning a specific task. To investigate this, we built a generative model of V1 optimized for a simple discrimination task and analyzed it together with large-scale recordings from mice performing an analogous task. In line with recent approaches, we assumed that neuronal activity in V1 corresponds to latent posteriors in the generative model, enabling investigation of task-related priors in neuronal responses. To obtain a flexible test bed, we extended the VAE formalism so that a task can be acquired efficiently by reusing previously learned representations. Task-specific priors learned by this Task-Amortized VAE were used to investigate biases in mice and model when presenting stimuli that violated trained task statistics. Mismatch between learned task statistics and incoming sensory evidence produced signatures of uncertainty in stimulus category in the TAVAE posterior, reflecting properties of bimodal response profiles in V1 recordings. The task-optimized generative model accounted for key characteristics of V1 population activity, including within-day updates to population responses. Our results confirm that flexible task-specific contextual priors can be learned on demand by the visual system and deployed as early as the entry level of visual cortex.",

We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \\emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \\methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \\emph{thresholds} and \\emph{gains}. During training, a smooth gate decides whether a neuron's activation participates; at inference the gate can be hardened to yield explicit conditional computation and neuron-level attributions.   As a proof of concept, we study ``mode specialization'' on MNIST (0$^\\circ$) versus rotated MNIST (45$^\\circ$). We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \\methodname{}. Across seeds, \\methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active). Compared to \\lora{}, \\methodname{} trades some accuracy for substantially fewer trainable parameters and a more interpretable ``which-neurons-fire'' mechanism.

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights.

We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks.

This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.   We separate measurement extraction from text generation.

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data.

However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (Cohen's $\u03ba$ < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean $\u03ba$ = 0.81 in PUB, but $\u03ba$ = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with $\u03ba$ = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median $\u03ba$ increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects.",

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data.

To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance.

SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets.

To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.",

Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes.

Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).",

This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints.

In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends.

      "abstract": "Understanding how humans and artificial intelligence systems process complex narrative videos is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has shown that scaling large language models (LLMs) improves their alignment with human brain activity, yet it remains unclear what drives these gains and which representational properties are responsible. Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling.",

We identified a geometric modularization where layers self-organize into stable low- and high-complexity clusters. The low-complexity module, characterized by reduced entropy and curvature, consistently better predicted human language network activity. This alignment followed heterogeneous spatial-temporal trajectories: rapid and stable in temporal regions (AntTemp, PostTemp), but delayed and dynamic in frontal areas (IFG, IFGorb). Crucially, reduced curvature remained a robust predictor of model-brain alignment even after controlling for training progress, an effect that strengthened with model scale. These results links training-driven geometric reorganization to temporal-frontal functional specialization, suggesting that representational smoothing facilitates neural-like linguistic processing.",

Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.",

I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems.

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

      "abstract": "NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

      "abstract": "Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space.

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.   Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.   The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.   This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Spinal instability is a widespread condition that causes pain, fatigue, and restricted mobility, profoundly affecting patients' quality of life. In clinical practice, the gold standard for diagnosis is dynamic X-ray imaging. However, X-ray provides only 2D motion information, while 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) cannot efficiently capture motion. Therefore, there is a need for a system capable of visualizing real-time 3D spinal motion while minimizing radiation exposure.   Methods: We propose ultrasound as an auxiliary modality for 3D spine visualization. Due to acoustic limitations, ultrasound captures only the superficial spinal surface. Therefore, the partially compounded ultrasound volume is registered to preoperative 3D imaging. In this study, CBCT provides the neutral spine configuration, while robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed at maximal spinal bending. A kinematic model is applied to the CBCT-derived spine model for coarse registration, followed by ICP for fine registration, with kinematic parameters optimized based on the registration results. Real-time ultrasound motion tracking is then used to estimate continuous 3D spinal motion by interpolating between the neutral and maximally bent states.   Results: The pipeline was evaluated on a bendable 3D-printed lumbar spine phantom. The registration error was $1.941 \\pm 0.199$ mm and the interpolated spinal motion error was $2.01 \\pm 0.309$ mm (median).   Conclusion: The proposed robotic ultrasound framework enables radiation-reduced, real-time 3D visualization of spinal motion, offering a promising 3D alternative to conventional dynamic X-ray imaging for assessing spinal instability.",

Experimental results show that Vietnamese-optimized models perform better on general segments, while multilingual pretraining helps capture English insertions. The combination of both approaches yields the best balance between overall and code-switched accuracy.

In contrast, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitous and inexpensive, and provides rich information on cardiac electrical activity and rhythm, yet offers limited insight into underlying cardiac structure and mechanical function. To address this, we introduce a contrastive learning framework that improves the extraction of clinically relevant cardiac phenotypes from ECG by learning from paired ECG-CMR data. Our approach aligns ECG representations with 3D CMR volumes at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES), with a dual-phase contrastive loss to anchor each ECG jointly with both cardiac phases in a shared latent space. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D CMR representations with or without a temporal component, our framework models 3D anatomy at both ED and ES phases as distinct latent representations, enabling flexible disentanglement of structural and functional cardiac properties. Using over 34,000 ECG-CMR pairs from the UK Biobank, we demonstrate improved extraction of image-derived phenotypes from ECG, particularly for functional parameters ($\\uparrow$ 9.2\\%), while improvements in clinical outcome prediction remained modest ($\\uparrow$ 0.7\\%).

      "abstract": "Radiological diagnosis is a perceptual process in which careful visual inspection and language reasoning are repeatedly interleaved. Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.",

We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker.

      "abstract": "Aberration often degrades ultrasound image quality when beamforming does not account for wavefront distortions. In the past decade, local sound speed estimators have been developed for distributed aberration correction throughout a medium. Recently, iterative sound speed optimization approaches have achieved more accurate estimates than earlier approaches, but these newer methods still struggle with decreased accuracy for media with reverberation clutter and large sound speed changes. To address these challenges, we propose using a wavefield correlation (WFC) beamforming approach when performing sound speed optimization. WFC correlates simulated forward-propagated transmit wavefields and backwards-propagated receive wavefields in order to form images. This process more accurately models wave propagation in heterogeneous media and can decrease diffuse clutter due to its spatiotemporal matched filtering effect. This beamformer is implemented using auto-differentiation software to then perform gradient descent optimization, using a total-variation regularized common midpoint phase focus metric loss, on the local sound speed map used during beamforming. This approach is compared to using delay and sum (DAS) with straight-ray time delay calculations in the same sound speed optimization approach on a variety of simulated, phantom, and in vivo data with large sound speed changes and clutter. Results show that using WFC decreases sound speed estimation error, and using the estimates for aberration correction improves image resolution and contrast. These promising results have potential to improve pulse-echo imaging for challenging clinical scenarios.",
