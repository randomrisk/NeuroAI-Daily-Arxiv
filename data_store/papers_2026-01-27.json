Existing neuronavigation systems are often costly, complex, and prone to tracking errors. To address these limitations, we present a computer vision based neuronavigation system that enables real time tracking of the patient and TMS instrumentation. The system integrates a multi camera optical tracking setup with consumer grade hardware and visible markers to drive a digital twin of the stimulation process. A dynamic 3D brain model in Unity updates in real time to visualize coil position and estimated stimulation targets. Augmented reality (AR) is further incorporated to project this model directly onto the patient's head, enabling intuitive, in situ coil adjustment without reliance on abstract numerical displays. Overall, the proposed approach improves spatial precision and accuracy while enhancing usability.",

As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications. We approach this analysis from diverse perspectives, from attack methodologies to countermeasure strategies that integrate efficiency and protection in brain-inspired hardware.

This complexity, however, increases power consumption, making the systems energy-intensive. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a novel generation of neural networks inspired by the highly efficient human brain. By emulating its event-driven and energy-efficient mechanisms, SNNs enable low-power, real-time signal processing. They differ from ANNs in two key ways: they exhibit inherent temporal dynamics and process and transmit information as short binary signals called spikes. Despite their promise, major challenges remain, e.g., identifying optimal learning rules and effective neural encoding. This thesis investigates the design of SNN-based receivers for nonlinear time-invariant frequency-selective channels. Backpropagation through time with surrogate gradients is identified as a promising update rule and the novel quantization encoding (QE) as promising neural encoding. Given the model of the intensity modulation with direct detection link, we compare two different receiver architectures based on equalization performance and spike count. Using decision feedback and QE achieves both strong performance and low spike counts. Notably, SNN-based receivers significantly outperform ANN-based counterparts. We furthermore introduce policy gradient-based update (PGU), an reinforcement learning-based update algorithm that requires no backpropagation. Using PGU, encoding parameters are optimized, drastically reducing runtime, complexity, and spikes per inference while maintaining performance. This thesis contributes a successful design and optimization framework for SNN-based receivers.

To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features.

Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.",

      "abstract": "Home-based music therapy devices require accessible and cost-effective solutions for users to understand and track their therapeutic progress. Traditional physiological signal analysis, particularly EEG interpretation, relies heavily on domain experts, creating barriers to scalability and home adoption. Meanwhile, few experts are capable of interpreting physiological signal data while also making targeted music recommendations. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, their application to automated physiological report generation for music therapy represents an unexplored task. We present a prototype system that leverages LLMs to bridge this gap -- transforming raw EEG and cardiovascular data into human-readable therapeutic reports and personalized music recommendations. Unlike prior work focusing on real-time physiological adaptation during listening, our approach emphasizes post-session analysis and interpretable reporting, enabling non-expert users to comprehend their psychophysiological states and track therapeutic outcomes over time. By integrating signal processing modules with LLM-based reasoning agents, the system provides a practical and low-cost solution for short-term progress monitoring in home music therapy contexts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying LLMs to a novel task -- democratizing access to physiology-driven music therapy through automated, interpretable reporting.",

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) decoding requires models that can effectively extract and integrate complex temporal, spectral, and spatial features from multichannel signals. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that each core component of the proposed framework contributes significantly to the overall decoding performance, demonstrating HCFT's effectiveness in capturing EEG dynamics and its potential for real-world BCI applications.",

While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT.

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.",

SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all.

To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases.

NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning.

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects.

However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter \u03bbin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global \u03bband do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.   In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings.

We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.   We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.",

      "abstract": "Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.",

Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity.

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.",

This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.",

This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(\u03bc\\to e \u03b3)\\simeq 1.6 \\times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $\u03bc\\to eee$ and $\u03bc$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach. Altogether, the radiative origin of neutrino masses links low-energy flavor observables to collider signatures, delineating discovery targets for MEG II, Mu2e/COMET, and the HL-LHC and distinguishing this framework from conventional inverse- and radiative-seesaw models. Moreover, the $Z_3$ guarantees a stable DM candidate, either scalar ($\u03c1$) or fermionic ($\u03a9$). Then, here we analyze and identify the viable parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic abundance for both situations.",

This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.",

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online.

This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes.

In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

      "abstract": "Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

      "abstract": "Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.",

This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.",

A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability.

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.",

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks.
