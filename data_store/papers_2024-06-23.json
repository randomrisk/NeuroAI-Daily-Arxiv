      "abstract": "We use (multi)modal deep neural networks (DNNs) to probe for sites of multimodal integration in the human brain by predicting stereoencephalography (SEEG) recordings taken while human subjects watched movies. We operationalize sites of multimodal integration as regions where a multimodal vision-language model predicts recordings better than unimodal language, unimodal vision, or linearly-integrated language-vision models. Our target DNN models span different architectures (e.g., convolutional networks and transformers) and multimodal training techniques (e.g., cross-attention and contrastive learning). As a key enabling step, we first demonstrate that trained vision and language models systematically outperform their randomly initialized counterparts in their ability to predict SEEG signals. We then compare unimodal and multimodal models against one another. Because our target DNN models often have different architectures, number of parameters, and training sets (possibly obscuring those differences attributable to integration), we carry out a controlled comparison of two models (SLIP and SimCLR), which keep all of these attributes the same aside from input modality. Using this approach, we identify a sizable number of neural sites (on average 141 out of 1090 total sites or 12.94%) and brain regions where multimodal integration seems to occur. Additionally, we find that among the variants of multimodal training techniques we assess, CLIP-style training is the best suited for downstream prediction of the neural activity in these sites."

      "abstract": "Graph deep learning (GDL) has demonstrated impressive performance in predicting population-based brain disorders (BDs) through the integration of both imaging and non-imaging data. However, the effectiveness of GDL based methods heavily depends on the quality of modeling the multi-modal population graphs and tends to degrade as the graph scale increases. Furthermore, these methods often constrain interactions between imaging and non-imaging data to node-edge interactions within the graph, overlooking complex inter-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we propose MM-GTUNets, an end-to-end graph transformer based multi-modal graph deep learning (MMGDL) framework designed for brain disorders prediction at large scale. Specifically, to effectively leverage rich multi-modal information related to diseases, we introduce Modality Reward Representation Learning (MRRL) which adaptively constructs population graphs using a reward system. Additionally, we employ variational autoencoder to reconstruct latent representations of non-imaging features aligned with imaging features. Based on this, we propose Adaptive Cross-Modal Graph Learning (ACMGL), which captures critical modality-specific and modality-shared features through a unified GTUNet encoder taking advantages of Graph UNet and Graph Transformer, and feature fusion module. We validated our method on two public multi-modal datasets ABIDE and ADHD-200, demonstrating its superior performance in diagnosing BDs.

Past studies identified efficient coding without control, or efficient control that neglects the cost of synthesizing information. Here we combine these concepts into a framework where agents rationally approximate inference for efficient control. Specifically, we study Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with an added internal cost on the relative precision of the posterior probability over the world state. This creates a trade-off: an agent can obtain more utility overall by sacrificing some task performance, if doing so saves enough bits during inference. We discover that the rational strategy that solves the joint inference and control problem goes through phase transitions depending on the task demands, switching from a costly but optimal inference to a family of suboptimal inferences related by rotation transformations, each misestimate the stability of the world. In all cases, the agent moves more to think less. This work provides a foundation for a new type of rational computations that could be used by both brains and machines for efficient but computationally constrained control."

Here, we report the observation of field-free electrical switching of nonreciprocal Ising superconductivity in Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure.

EMUSES facilitates the exploration and prediction of emergent properties by statistically analyzing these latent spaces. Using three distinct datasets--a handwritten digits dataset from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, E.

Our method not only predicts outcomes with high accuracy but also provides clear visualizations and statistical insights into the underlying interactions within the data. By bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and interpretability, EMUSES offers researchers a powerful tool to understand the multifactorial origins of complex phenomena."

However, the absence of segmentation that highlights brain degenerative changes presents unique challenges for training CNN-based classifiers in a supervised fashion. In this work, we evaluated several unsupervised methods to train a feature extractor for downstream AD vs. CN classification. Using the 3D T1-weighted MRI data of cognitive normal (CN) subjects from the synthetic neuroimaging LDM100K dataset, lightweight 3D CNN-based models are trained for brain age prediction, brain image rotation classification, brain image reconstruction and a multi-head task combining all three tasks into one. Feature extractors trained on the LDM100K synthetic dataset achieved similar performance compared to the same model using real-world data. This supports the feasibility of utilising large-scale synthetic data for pretext task training. All the training and testing splits are performed on the subject-level to prevent data leakage issues. Alongside the simple preprocessing steps, the random cropping data augmentation technique shows consistent improvement across all experiments."

Understanding gaze patterns is crucial for gaining insights into the computation underlying the problem-solving process. However, there is a lack of interpretable models that can account for how the brain directs the eyes to collect information and utilize it, especially in the context of complex problem solving. In the current study, we analyzed the gaze patterns of two monkeys playing the Pac-Man game. We trained a transformer network to mimic the monkeys' gameplay and found its attention pattern captures the monkeys' eye movements. In addition, the prediction based on the transformer network's attention outperforms the human subjects' predictions. Importantly, we dissected the computation underlying the attention mechanism of the transformer network, revealing its layered structures reflecting a value-based attention component and a component that captures the interactions between Pac-Man and other game objects. Based on these findings, we built a condensed attention model that is not only as accurate as the transformer network but also fully interpretable. Our results highlight the potential of using transformer neural networks to model and understand the cognitive processes underlying complex problem solving in the brain, opening new avenues for investigating the neural basis of cognition."

      "abstract": "The modeling of the interaction between a poroelastic medium and a fluid in a hollow cavity is crucial for understanding, e.g., the multiphysics flow of blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in the brain, the supply of blood by the coronary arteries in heart perfusion, or the interaction between groundwater and rivers or lakes. In particular, the cerebral tissue's elasticity and its perfusion by blood and interstitial CSF can be described by Multi-compartment Poroelasticity (MPE), while CSF flow in the brain ventricles can be modeled by the (Navier-)Stokes equations, the overall system resulting in a coupled MPE-(Navier-)Stokes system. The aim of this paper is three-fold. First, we aim to extend and verify in a three-dimensional setting a discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids recently presented for the MPE-Stokes problem. Second, we carry out the analysis of the method based on an extension of the proposed formulation so that physics-based Beavers-Joseph-Saffman conditions are taken into account at the interface: these conditions are essential to model the friction between the fluid and the porous medium. Finally, by a comparative numerical investigation, we assess the fluid-dynamics effects of these boundary conditions and of employing either Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations to model the CSF flow. The semidiscrete numerical scheme for the coupled problem is proved to be stable and optimally convergent. Temporal discretization is obtained using Newmark's $\\beta$-method for the elastic wave equation and the $\\theta$-method for the remaining equations of the model. The theoretical error estimates are verified by numerical simulations on a test case with a manufactured solution, and a numerical investigation is carried out on a three-dimensional geometry to assess the effects of interface conditions and fluid inertia on the system."

This study investigates the impact of a system immersion of a driving simulator on the drivers' brain activity while operating a conditionally automated vehicle. Nineteen participants drove approximately 40 minutes while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We found a significant effect of the system immersion in the occipital and parietal areas, primarily in the high-Beta bandwidth. No effect was found in the Theta, Alpha, and low-Beta bandwidths.

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features."

A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively).

Three HMI designs were developed, among which significant differences in mental workload using NASA-TLX and the subjective transparency test were found. An electroencephalogram was applied throughout the study to determine if differences in the mental workload could also be found using EEG's spectral power analysis. Results suggested that more studies are required to determine the effectiveness of the spectral power of EEG on mental workload, but the three interface designs developed in this study could serve as a solid basis for future research to evaluate the effectiveness of psychophysiological measures.

The CLDTA employs a diagonal masking strategy within its encoder to extracts full-channel EEG data's brain network knowledge, facilitating transferability to the datasets with fewer channels. And an information separation mechanism improves model interpretability by enabling straightforward visualization of brain networks. The CLDTA framework employs contrastive learning to distill subject-independent emotional representations and uses a calibration prediction process to enable rapid adaptation of the model to new subjects with minimal samples, achieving accurate emotion recognition. Our analysis across the SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and DEAP datasets highlights CLDTA's consistent performance and proficiency in detecting both task-specific and general features of EEG signals related to emotions, underscoring its potential to revolutionize emotion recognition research."

In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods."

Despite this, the technology is still emerging and has not yet been outside the laboratory constraints. Channel reduction is one contributing avenue to make these systems part of ADL. Although Motor Imagery classification heavily depends on spatial factors, single channel-based classification remains an avenue to be explored thoroughly. Since Fisher's ratio and Pearson Correlation are powerful measures actively used in the domain, we propose an integrated framework (FRPC integrated framework) that integrates Fisher's Ratio to select the best channel and Pearson correlation to select optimal filter banks and extract spectral and temporal features respectively. The framework is tested for a 2-class motor imagery classification on 2 open-source datasets and 1 collected dataset and compared with state-of-art work. Apart from implementing the framework, this study also explores the most optimal channel among all the subjects and later explores classes where the single-channel framework is efficient."

Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics."

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features."

Dynamic stopping methods enhance BCI system speed by deciding at any moment whether to output a result or wait for more information. Such approach leverages trial variance, allowing good trials to be detected earlier, thereby speeding up the process without significantly compromising accuracy. Existing dynamic stopping algorithms typically optimize measures such as symbols per minute (SPM) and information transfer rate (ITR). However, these metrics may not accurately reflect system performance for specific applications or user types. Moreover, many methods depend on arbitrary thresholds or parameters that require extensive training data. We propose a model-based approach that takes advantage of the analytical knowledge that we have about the underlying classification model. By using a risk minimisation approach, our model allows precise control over the types of errors and the balance between precision and speed. This adaptability makes it ideal for customizing BCI systems to meet the diverse needs of various applications. We validate our proposed method on a publicly available dataset, comparing it with established static and dynamic stopping methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach offers a broad range of accuracy-speed trade-offs and achieves higher precision than baseline stopping methods."

Often used because of their ease of grading, even the best multiple choice (MC) tests, those using research based distractors (wrong answers) are intrinsically limited in the insights they provide due to two factors. When distractors do not reflect student beliefs they can be ignored, increasing the likelihood that the correct answer will be chosen by chance. Moreover, making the correct choice does not guarantee that the student understands why it is correct. To address these limitations, we recommend asking students to explain why they chose their answer, and why \"wrong\" choices are wrong. Using a discipline-trained artificial intelligence-based bot it is possible to analyze their explanations, identifying the concepts and scientific principles that maybe missing or misapplied. The bot also makes suggestions for how instructors can use these data to better guide student thinking. In a small \"proof of concept\" study, we tested this approach using questions from the Biology Concepts Instrument (BCI). The result was rapid, informative, and provided actionable feedback on student thinking. It appears that the use of AI addresses the weaknesses of conventional MC test. It seems likely that incorporating AI-analyzed formative assessments will lead to improved overall learning outcomes."

This capability has the potential to significantly enhance applications ranging from simulating dynamic brain activity and data augmentation to improving real-time epilepsy detection and BCI inference. By harnessing generative transformer neural networks, specifically designed for EEG signal generation, we can revolutionize the interpretation and interaction with neural data. Generative AI has demonstrated significant success across various domains, from natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to content creation in visual arts and music. It distinguishes itself by using large-scale datasets to construct context windows during pre-training, a technique that has proven particularly effective in NLP, where models are fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks after extensive foundational training. However, the application of generative AI in the field of BCIs, particularly through the development of continuous, context-rich neural signal generators, has been limited. To address this, we introduce the Generative EEG Transformer (GET), a model leveraging transformer architecture tailored for EEG data. The GET model is pre-trained on diverse EEG datasets, including motor imagery and alpha wave datasets, enabling it to produce high-fidelity neural signals that maintain contextual integrity. Our empirical findings indicate that GET not only faithfully reproduces the frequency spectrum of the training data and input prompts but also robustly generates continuous neural signals. By adopting the successful training strategies of the NLP domain for BCIs, the GET sets a new standard for the development and application of neural signal generation technologies."

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals.

In this work, we utilized cBCI and designed a cooperative four-classes MI task to train the dyad. A humanoid robot would stimulate the dyad to conduct both left/right hand and tongue/foot MI. Single user was asked to conduct single MI task before and after the cooperative MI task.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large EEG Models (LEMs). We hope that LEMs can break through the limitations of different task types of EEG datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training. Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. However, compared to text data, the volume of EEG datasets is generally small and the format varies widely. For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for EEG called Large Brain Model (LaBraM). LaBraM enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the EEG signals into EEG channel patches. Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes. We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches. The LaBraMs were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks. Experiments on abnormal detection, event type classification, emotion recognition, and gait prediction show that our LaBraM outperforms all compared SOTA methods in their respective fields.

Our Encoder trains to predict the response of each brain-voxel on every image, by directly computing the cross-attention between the brain-voxel embedding and multi-level deep image features. This voxel-centric architecture allows the functional role of each brain-voxel to naturally emerge from the voxel-image cross-attention.

EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels.

Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%.

BrainChat employs the self-supervised approach of Masked Brain Modeling to encode sparse fMRI data, obtaining a more compact embedding representation in the latent space. Subsequently, BrainChat bridges the gap between modalities by applying contrastive loss, resulting in aligned representations of fMRI, image, and text embeddings. Furthermore, the fMRI embeddings are mapped to the generative Brain Decoder via cross-attention layers, where they guide the generation of textual content about fMRI in a regressive manner by minimizing caption loss. Empirically, BrainChat exceeds the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods in the fMRI captioning task and, for the first time, implements fMRI question answering.

More precise capture of higher-order interactions enables a better reflection of the brain's intrinsic neurophysiological characteristics. One well-established neurophysiological concept is Homotopic Functional Connectivity (HoFC), which illustrates the synchronized spontaneous activity between corresponding regions in the brain's left and right hemispheres.

We assess the efficacy of different functional connectivity parameterizations using HoFC. The results indicates that the quality of capturing higher-order interactions largely depends on the statistical dependency measure between brain regions. Higher-order interactions defined by partial correlation, better reflects HoFC compare to other statistical associations. In this case of first-order interactions, tangent space embedding more effectively demonstrates HoFC. The findings validate HoFC and underscore the importance of functional connectivity construction method in capturing intrinsic characteristics of the human brain."

Being able to visualize and understand the data from the start through the completion of processing, while being confident that each intermediate step was successful, is challenging. AFNI's \"afni_proc.py\" is a tool to create and run a processing pipeline for FMRI data. With its flexible features, \"afni_proc.py\" allows users to both control and evaluate their processing at a detailed level. It has been designed to keep users informed about all processing steps: it does not just process the data, but first outputs a fully commented processing script that the users can read, query, interpret and refer back to. Having this full provenance is important for being able to understand each step of processing; it also promotes transparency and reproducibility by keeping the record of individual-level processing and modeling specifics in a single, shareable place. Additionally, \"afni_proc.py\" creates pipelines that contain several automatic self-checks for potential problems during runtime. The output directory contains a dictionary of relevant quantities that can be programmatically queried for potential issues and a systematic, interactive quality control (QC) HTML. All of these features help users evaluate and understand their data and processing in detail. We describe these and other aspects of \"afni_proc.py\" here using a set of task-based and resting state FMRI example commands."

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.",

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals. We achieve an impressive BLEU-1 score on the $\\textit{GWilliams}$ dataset, significantly outperforming the baseline from 5.49 to 10.44 on the BLEU-1 metric.

      "abstract": "Growing interest and investment in the capabilities of foundation models has positioned such systems to impact a wide array of public services. Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the \"foundation\" layer, our framework proposes the \"subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the \"surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate \"subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer."

      "abstract": "Using drones to track multiple individuals simultaneously in their natural environment is a powerful approach for better understanding group primate behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\\% for the X3D behavior recognition model. Using deep learning to classify wildlife behavior from drone footage facilitates non-invasive insight into the collective behavior of an entire group."

In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment.",

In this paper, we formally define and study the problem of identifying such minimal evidence groups (MEGs) for claim verification. We show that MEG identification can be reduced from Set Cover problem, based on entailment inference of whether a given evidence group provides full/partial support to a claim. Our proposed approach achieves 18.4% and 34.8% absolute improvements on the WiCE and SciFact datasets over LLM prompting.

We retrospectively analysed data from 17,(46) healthy controls and 22,(24) individuals with TLE who underwent scalp EEG and (MEG) recordings as part of presurgical evaluation. Resting-state, eyes-closed recordings were source reconstructed using the standardized low-resolution brain electrographic tomography (sLORETA) method. We extracted low (slow) 6-9 Hz and high (fast) 10-11 Hz alpha relative band power and calculated the alpha power ratio by dividing low (slow) alpha by high (fast) alpha. This ratio was computed for all brain regions in all individuals.   Alpha oscillations were slower in individuals with TLE than controls (p<0.05). This effect was present in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, and across widespread brain regions.   Alpha slowing in TLE was found in both EEG and MEG recordings. We interpret greater low (slow)-alpha as greater deviation from health."

This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation. All code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricsinaruto/MEG-transfer-decoding).",

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

      "abstract": "Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "There is a dire need for medical imaging datasets with accompanying annotations to perform downstream patient analysis. However, it is difficult to manually generate these annotations, due to the time-consuming nature, and the variability in clinical conventions. Artificial intelligence has been adopted in the field as a potential method to annotate these large datasets, however, a lack of expert annotations or ground truth can inhibit the adoption of these annotations. We recently made a dataset publicly available including annotations and extracted features of up to 104 organs for the National Lung Screening Trial using the TotalSegmentator method. However, the released dataset does not include expert-derived annotations or an assessment of the accuracy of the segmentations, limiting its usefulness. We propose the development of heuristics to assess the quality of the segmentations, providing methods to measure the consistency of the annotations and a comparison of results to the literature. We make our code and related materials publicly available at https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/CloudSegmentatorResults and interactive tools at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ImagingDataCommons/CloudSegmentatorResults."

      "abstract": "The increasing availability of biomedical data is helping to design more robust deep learning (DL) algorithms to analyze biomedical samples. Currently, one of the main limitations to train DL algorithms to perform a specific task is the need for medical experts to label data. Automatic methods to label data exist, however automatic labels can be noisy and it is not completely clear when automatic labels can be adopted to train DL models. This paper aims to investigate under which circumstances automatic labels can be adopted to train a DL model on the classification of Whole Slide Images (WSI). The analysis involves multiple architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), and over 10000 WSIs, collected from three use cases: celiac disease, lung cancer and colon cancer, which one including respectively binary, multiclass and multilabel data. The results allow identifying 10% as the percentage of noisy labels that lead to train competitive models for the classification of WSIs. Therefore, an algorithm generating automatic labels needs to fit this criterion to be adopted. The application of the Semantic Knowledge Extractor Tool (SKET) algorithm to generate automatic labels leads to performance comparable to the one obtained with manual labels, since it generates a percentage of noisy labels between 2-5%. Automatic labels are as effective as manual ones, reaching solid performance comparable to the one obtained training models with manual labels."

To address this, we proposed medIKAL (Integrating Knowledge Graphs as Assistants of LLMs), a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance diagnostic capabilities. medIKAL assigns weighted importance to entities in medical records based on their type, enabling precise localization of candidate diseases within KGs. It innovatively employs a residual network-like approach, allowing initial diagnosis by the LLM to be merged into KG search results. Through a path-based reranking algorithm and a fill-in-the-blank style prompt template, it further refined the diagnostic process. We validated medIKAL's effectiveness through extensive experiments on a newly introduced open-sourced Chinese EMR dataset, demonstrating its potential to improve clinical diagnosis in real-world settings."

      "abstract": "This study introduces a novel knowledge enhanced tokenisation mechanism, K-Tokeniser, for clinical text processing. Technically, at initialisation stage, K-Tokeniser populates global representations of tokens based on semantic types of domain concepts (such as drugs or diseases) from either a domain ontology like Unified Medical Language System or the training data of the task related corpus. At training or inference stage, sentence level localised context will be utilised for choosing the optimal global token representation to realise the semantic-based tokenisation. To avoid pretraining using the new tokeniser, an embedding initialisation approach is proposed to generate representations for new tokens. Using three transformer-based language models, a comprehensive set of experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets for evaluating K-Tokeniser in a wide range of clinical text analytics tasks including clinical concept and relation extraction, automated clinical coding, clinical phenotype identification, and clinical research article classification. Overall, our models demonstrate consistent improvements over their counterparts in all tasks. In particular, substantial improvements are observed in the automated clinical coding task with 13\\% increase on Micro $F_1$ score. Furthermore, K-Tokeniser also shows significant capacities in facilitating quicker converge of language models. Specifically, using K-Tokeniser, the language models would only require 50\\% of the training data to achieve the best performance of the baseline tokeniser using all training data in the concept extraction task and less than 20\\% of the data for the automated coding task. It is worth mentioning that all these improvements require no pre-training process, making the approach generalisable."

      "abstract": "Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to generalize a model using data from only one source domain to segment data from an unseen target domain. Despite substantial advances in SDG with data augmentation, existing methods often fail to fully consider the details and uncertain areas prevalent in MIS, leading to mis-segmentation. This paper proposes a Fourier-based semantic augmentation method called FIESTA using uncertainty guidance to enhance the fundamental goals of MIS in an SDG context by manipulating the amplitude and phase components in the frequency domain. The proposed Fourier augmentative transformer addresses semantic amplitude modulation based on meaningful angular points to induce pertinent variations and harnesses the phase spectrum to ensure structural coherence. Moreover, FIESTA employs epistemic uncertainty to fine-tune the augmentation process, improving the ability of the model to adapt to diverse augmented data and concentrate on areas with higher ambiguity. Extensive experiments across three cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that FIESTA surpasses recent state-of-the-art SDG approaches in segmentation performance and significantly contributes to boosting the applicability of the model in medical imaging modalities."

      "abstract": "Ambient field suppression is critical for accurate magnetic field measurements, and a requirement for certain low-field sensors to operate. The difference in magnitude between noise and signal (up to 10$^9$) makes the problem challenging, and solutions such as passive shielding, post-hoc processing, and most active shielding designs do not address it completely. Zero field active shielding (ZFS) achieves accurate field suppression with a feed-forward structure in which correction coils are fed by reference sensors via a matrix found using data-driven methods. Requirements are a sufficient number of correction coils and reference sensors to span the ambient field at the sensors, and to zero out the coil-to-reference sensor coupling. The solution assumes instantaneous propagation and mixing, but it can be extended to handle convolutional effects. Precise calculations based on sensor and coil geometries are not necessary, other than to improve efficiency and usability. The solution is simulated here but not implemented in hardware."

      "abstract": "Single-view depth estimation refers to the ability to derive three-dimensional information per pixel from a single two-dimensional image. Single-view depth estimation is an ill-posed problem because there are multiple depth solutions that explain 3D geometry from a single view. While deep neural networks have been shown to be effective at capturing depth from a single view, the majority of current methodologies are deterministic in nature. Accounting for uncertainty in the predictions can avoid disastrous consequences when applied to fields such as autonomous driving or medical robotics. We have addressed this problem by quantifying the uncertainty of supervised single-view depth for Bayesian deep neural networks. There are scenarios, especially in medicine in the case of endoscopic images, where such annotated data is not available. To alleviate the lack of data, we present a method that improves the transition from synthetic to real domain methods. We introduce an uncertainty-aware teacher-student architecture that is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking into account the teacher uncertainty. Given the vast amount of unannotated data and the challenges associated with capturing annotated depth in medical minimally invasive procedures, we advocate a fully self-supervised approach that only requires RGB images and the geometric and photometric calibration of the endoscope. In endoscopic imaging, the camera and light sources are co-located at a small distance from the target surfaces. This setup indicates that brighter areas of the image are nearer to the camera, while darker areas are further away. Building on this observation, we exploit the fact that for any given albedo and surface orientation, pixel brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. We propose the use of illumination as a strong single-view self-supervisory signal for deep neural networks."

In this work, we aim to provide an analysis of how segmentation fails across different models and consider the question of whether these can be predicted reasonably at test time. To do so, we explore existing uncertainty-based metrics and see how well they correlate with misclassifications, allowing us to define the degree of trust we put in the output of our prediction models. Through several experiments on three different models across three datasets, we show that simple measures such as entropy can be used to capture misclassification with high recall rates."

However, most of these methods fail to enable the diffusion model to learn edge features and non-edge features effectively and to inject them efficiently into the diffusion backbone. Additionally, the domain gap between the images features and the diffusion model features poses a great challenge to prostate segmentation. In this paper, we proposed CriDiff, a two-stage feature injecting framework with a Crisscross Injection Strategy (CIS) and a Generative Pre-train (GP) approach for prostate segmentation. The CIS maximizes the use of multi-level features by efficiently harnessing the complementarity of high and low-level features. To effectively learn multi-level of edge features and non-edge features, we proposed two parallel conditioners in the CIS: the Boundary Enhance Conditioner (BEC) and the Core Enhance Conditioner (CEC), which discriminatively model the image edge regions and non-edge regions, respectively. Moreover, the GP approach eases the inconsistency between the images features and the diffusion model without adding additional parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve state-of-the-art performance on four evaluation metrics.",

The accuracy of a diagnostic text, however, strongly depends on how well the key medical conditions depicted in the images are expressed. We propose a new data-driven guided decoding method that incorporates medical information, in the form of existing tags capturing key conditions of the image(s), into the beam search of the diagnostic text generation process. We evaluate the proposed method on two medical datasets using four DC systems that range from generic image-to-text systems with CNN encoders and RNN decoders to pre-trained Large Language Models. The latter can also be used in few- and zero-shot learning scenarios. In most cases, the proposed mechanism improves performance with respect to all evaluation measures.
