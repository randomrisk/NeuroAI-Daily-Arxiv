      "abstract": "Segmenting healthy tissue structures alongside lesions in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) remains a challenge for today's algorithms due to lesion-caused disruption of the anatomy and lack of jointly labeled training datasets, where both healthy tissues and lesions are labeled on the same images. In this paper, we propose a method that is robust to lesion-caused disruptions and can be trained from disparately labeled training sets, i.e., without requiring jointly labeled samples, to automatically segment both. In contrast to prior work, we decouple healthy tissue and lesion segmentation in two paths to leverage multi-sequence acquisitions and merge information with an attention mechanism. During inference, an image-specific adaptation reduces adverse influences of lesion regions on healthy tissue predictions. During training, the adaptation is taken into account through meta-learning and co-training is used to learn from disparately labeled training images. Our model shows an improved performance on several anatomical structures and lesions on a publicly available brain glioblastoma dataset compared to the state-of-the-art segmentation methods."

      "abstract": "Our brain recognizes only a tiny fraction of sensory input, due to an information processing bottleneck. This blinds us to most visual inputs. Since we are blind to this blindness, only a recent framework highlights this bottleneck by formulating vision as mainly looking and seeing. Looking selects a tiny fraction of visual information for progression through the bottleneck, mainly by shifting gaze to center an attentional spotlight. Seeing decodes, i.e., recognizes, objects within the selected information. Since looking often occurs before seeing and evokes limited awareness, humans have the impression of seeing whole scenes clearly. According to the new framework, the bottleneck starts from the output of the primary visual cortex (V1) to downstream brain areas. This is motivated by the evidence-backed V1 Saliency Hypothesis (V1SH) that V1 creates a saliency map of the visual field to guide looking. Massive visual information loss downstream from V1 makes seeing vulnerable to ambiguity and illusions (errors). To overcome this, feedback from downstream to upstream areas such as V1 queries for additional relevant information. An integral part of this framework is the central-peripheral dichotomy (CPD) theory proposing that vision in the peripheral and central visual fields are specialized for looking (deciding where to shift the gaze) and seeing, respectively, and that the feedback query to aid seeing is mainly directed to the central visual field. This V1SH-Bottleneck-CPD framework predicts that the peripheral visual field, lacking feedback queries, is more vulnerable to illusions, and that such illusions become visible in the central visual field when the feedback query is compromised. We present theoretical predictions, experimental confirmations, a Feedforward-Feedback-Verify-and-reWeight (FFVW) algorithm for seeing through the bottleneck."

      "abstract": "According to the forgetting curve theory, we can enhance memory retention by learning extensive data and taking adequate rest. This means that in order to effectively retain new knowledge, it is essential to learn it thoroughly and ensure sufficient rest so that our brain can memorize without forgetting. The main takeaway from this theory is that learning extensive data at once necessitates sufficient rest before learning the same data again. This aspect of human long-term memory retention can be effectively utilized to address the continual learning of neural networks. Retaining new knowledge for a long period of time without catastrophic forgetting is the critical problem of continual learning. Therefore, based on Ebbinghaus' theory, we introduce the view-batch model that adjusts the learning schedules to optimize the recall interval between retraining the same samples. The proposed view-batch model allows the network to get enough rest to learn extensive knowledge from the same samples with a recall interval of sufficient length. To this end, we specifically present two approaches: 1) a replay method that guarantees the optimal recall interval, and 2) a self-supervised learning that acquires extensive knowledge from a single training sample at a time. We empirically show that these approaches of our method are aligned with the forgetting curve theory, which can enhance long-term memory. In our experiments, we also demonstrate that our method significantly improves many state-of-the-art continual learning methods in various protocols and scenarios. We open-source this project at https://github.com/hankyul2/ViewBatchModel."

To effectively capture inter-slice relationships within volumes, we introduce a Spatial Transformation Module that encodes MRI images into a compact latent space for the diffusion process. Moving beyond unconditional generation, our novel ZeroFusion method progressively maps 3D masks to MRI images in latent space, enabling robust training on limited datasets while avoiding overfitting. ZECO outperforms state-of-the-art models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on Brain MRI datasets across various modalities, showcasing its exceptional capability in synthesizing high-quality MRI images conditioned on segmentation masks."

To construct DualCP, we propose a Concept Prototype Generator (CPG) that generates both coarse-grained and fine-grained prototypes for each class.

      "abstract": "There is a need for fast adaptation in spike sorting algorithms to implement brain-machine interface (BMIs) in different applications. Learning and adapting the functionality of the sorting process in real-time can significantly improve the performance. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) depend on large amounts of data for training models and their performance sustainability decreases when data is limited. Inspired by meta-learning, this paper proposes a few-shot spike sorting framework (FS-SS) with variable network model size that requires minimal learning training and supervision. The framework is not only compatible with few-shot adaptations, but also it uses attention mechanism and dilated convolutional neural networks. This allows scaling the network parameters to learn the important features of spike signals and to quickly generalize the learning ability to new spike waveforms in recording channels after few observations. The FS-SS was evaluated by using freely accessible datasets, also compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method is 99.28%, which shows extreme robustness to background noise and similarity of the spike waveforms. When the number of training samples is reduced by 90%, the parameter scale is reduced by 68.2%, while the accuracy only decreased by 0.55%. The paper also visualizes the model's attention distribution under spike sorting tasks of different difficulty levels. The attention distribution results show that the proposed model has clear interpretability and high robustness."

      "abstract": "Objectives: Many existing techniques for the non-invasive quantification of the blood input function in dynamic FDG-PET imaging require strong historical information or user input. The technique proposed in this work utilizes the assumption that a dynamic PET scan can be modeled by the Patlak plot to determine an unscaled blood input function. Materials and Methods: The time activity curve (TAC) for each voxel in a dynamic image can be considered as an n-dimensional vector. In this context, a TAC follows the Patlak plot if and only if the TAC is a linear combination of the blood input function and the integral of the blood input function. Given a set of TACs which follow the Patlak plot, we can thus use PCA to determine a basis which spans the same vector space as the blood input function and the integral of the blood input function. We then seek to find two TACs in this vector space which best satisfy that the estimated anti-derivative of one of the TACs is close to the other TAC; such TACs are candidates for the blood input function and the integral of the blood input function. We were able to construct a low (2) dimensional optimization problem to find such TACs. Results: We applied our results to obtain predicted blood input functions and Ki maps for twelve normal subjects. Scaling the predicted blood input function to best match the ground truth, we achieved an average SSE of $0.042 \\pm 0.032$ and an average DTW distance of $0.141 \\pm 0.053$. Matching the means of the predicted and ground truth Ki maps, we achieved an average MAPE of $2.539 \\pm 0.928$ and an average SSIM of $0.991 \\pm 0.005$. Conclusion: While not often viewed as such, the assumption that some dynamic data follows a kinetic model gives strong prior information. In the case of the Patlak plot, we can use this assumption to estimate an unscaled blood input function and unscaled Ki map."

In this work, we assess the applicability and utility of an AI-based model for brain aneurysm detection comparing the performance of two readers with different levels of experience (2 and 13 years). We aim to answer the following questions: 1) Do the readers improve their performance when assisted by the AI algorithm? 2) How much does the AI algorithm impact routine clinical workflow? We reuse and enlarge our open-access, Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography dataset (N=460). We use 360 subjects for training/validating our algorithm and 100 as unseen test set for the reading session. Even though our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false positive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader significantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In addition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in the \"AI-assisted\" setting than in the \"Unassisted\" (+15 seconds, on average; p=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers is unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does not influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting involving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community to always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed algorithms."

      "abstract": "The automatic generation of brain CT reports has gained widespread attention, given its potential to assist radiologists in diagnosing cranial diseases. However, brain CT scans involve extensive medical entities, such as diverse anatomy regions and lesions, exhibiting highly inconsistent spatial patterns in 3D volumetric space. This leads to biased learning of medical entities in existing methods, resulting in repetitiveness and inaccuracy in generated reports. To this end, we propose a Medical Entity-balanced Prompting Network (MEPNet), which harnesses the large language model (LLM) to fairly interpret various entities for accurate brain CT report generation. By introducing the visual embedding and the learning status of medical entities as enriched clues, our method prompts the LLM to balance the learning of diverse entities, thereby enhancing reports with comprehensive findings. First, to extract visual embedding of entities, we propose Knowledge-driven Joint Attention to explore and distill entity patterns using both explicit and implicit medical knowledge. Then, a Learning Status Scorer is designed to evaluate the learning of entity visual embeddings, resulting in unique learning status for individual entities. Finally, these entity visual embeddings and status are elaborately integrated into multi-modal prompts, to guide the text generation of LLM. This process allows LLM to self-adapt the learning process for biased-fitted entities, thereby covering detailed findings in generated reports. We conduct experiments on two brain CT report generation benchmarks, showing the effectiveness in clinical accuracy and text coherence."

The approach utilizes high-resolution light-sheet fluorescence microscopy images of rodent brain vasculature, simulating gradient echo sampling of free induction decay and spin echo (GESFIDE) MRI signals for the three-dimensional vascular networks, and training a deep learning model to predict cerebral blood volume (CBV) and VSD from GESFIDE signals. The results from ex vivo experiments demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.96) between the true and predicted CBV. High similarity between true and predicted VSDs was observed (mean Bhattacharya Coefficient = 0.92).

To enrich the dataset, participants' personality traits, anxiety, depression, and emotional states were assessed using validated questionnaires. By capturing a broad spectrum of affective responses while accounting for individual differences, this dataset provides a robust resource for precise emotion modeling. The integration of multimodal physiological data with psychological assessments lays a strong foundation for personalized emotion recognition.

Our analysis across different brain regions and frequency bands showed distinct spatial-spectral patterns of PD-related neural oscillations. We identified high classification accuracy (76%) using central electrodes (C3, Cz, C4) with full-spectrum 0.4-62.4 Hz analysis and 74% accuracy in right parietal regions (P8, CP6, P4) with 10-second windows. Bilateral centro-parietal regions showed strong performance (67%) in the theta band (4.0-7.79 Hz), while multiple areas demonstrated some sensitivity (65%) in the alpha band (7.8-15.59 Hz). We also observed a distinctive topographical pattern of gamma band (40-62.4 Hz) alterations specifically localized to central-parietal regions, which remained consistent across different temporal windows. In particular, we observed pronounced right-hemisphere involvement across several frequency bands. Unlike previous studies that achieved higher accuracies by potentially including tremor artifacts, our approach isolates genuine neurophysiological alterations in cortical activity. These findings suggest that specific EEG-based oscillatory patterns, especially in central and parietal regions and across multiple frequency bands, may provide diagnostic information for PD, potentially before the onset of motor symptoms."

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs.

In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting.

Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials.

      "abstract": "Sound source localization relies on spatial cues such as interaural time differences (ITD), interaural level differences (ILD), and monaural spectral cues. Individually measured Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) facilitate precise spatial hearing but are impractical to measure, necessitating non-individual HRTFs, which may compromise localization accuracy and externalization. To further investigate this phenomenon, the neurophysiological differences between free-field and non-individual HRTF listening are explored by decoding sound locations from EEG-derived Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). Twenty-two participants localized stimuli under both conditions with EEG responses recorded and logistic regression classifiers trained to distinguish sound source locations.   Lower cortical response amplitudes were observed for KEMAR compared to free-field, especially in front-central and occipital-parietal regions. ANOVA identified significant main effects of auralization condition (F(1, 21) = 34.56, p < 0.0001) and location (F(3, 63) = 18.17, p < 0.0001) on decoding accuracy (DA), which was higher in free-field and interaural-cue-dominated locations. DA negatively correlated with front-back confusion rates (r = -0.57, p < 0.01), linking neural DA to perceptual confusion.   These findings demonstrate that headphone-based non-individual HRTFs elicit lower amplitude cortical responses to static, azimuthally-varying locations than free-field conditions. The correlation between EEG-based DA and front-back confusion underscores neurophysiological markers' potential for assessing spatial auditory discrimination."

Data is a critical resource in BCI research and a key factor in the development of BCI technology, making efficient storage and management of this data increasingly vital. In the realm of research, ample data can facilitate the development of novel algorithms, which can be more accurately validated. In terms of applications, well-organized data can foster the emergence of new business opportunities, thereby maximizing the commercial value of the data. Currently, there are two major challenges in the storage and management of BCI data: providing different classification storage modes for multi-modal data, and adapting to varying application scenarios while improving storage strategies. To address these challenges, this study has developed the NeuroStore BCI data persistence system, which provides a general and easily scalable data model and can effectively handle multiple types of data storage. The system has a flexible distributed framework and can be widely applied to various scenarios.

Recent studies have reported higher-than-chance performance in decoding handwritten letters from EEG signals, potentially allowing these subjects to communicate. However, all prior works have attempted to decode handwriting from EEG during actual motion. Furthermore, they assume that precise movement-onset is known. In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI."

To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression."

      "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems traditionally used in medicine and designed to interact with the brain to record or stimulate neurons. Despite their benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on neurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In this context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt spontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition. Previous work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced number of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this limitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of the primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons, tested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting gratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus, also testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results, based on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the attacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and fixed events are the most robust. Although both attacks can significantly affect neural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal delays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many neurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO increased with the number of neurons attacked.",

To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.",

Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness."

In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex."

However, current spatiotemporal attention modules handle temporal and spatial attention separately, extracting temporal and spatial features either sequentially or in parallel. These approaches overlook the inherent spatiotemporal correlations present in real world fMRI data. Additionally, the presence of noise in fMRI data further limits the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel brain effective connectivity estimation method based on Fourier spatiotemporal attention (FSTA-EC), which combines Fourier attention and spatiotemporal attention to simultaneously capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal) dependencies from high-noise fMRI data. Specifically, Fourier attention is designed to convert the high-noise fMRI data to frequency domain, and map the denoised fMRI data back to physical domain, and spatiotemporal attention is crafted to simultaneously learn spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, through a series of proofs, we demonstrate that incorporating learnable filter into fast Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform processes is mathematically equivalent to performing cyclic convolution. The experimental results on simulated and real-resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing."

However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments."

For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

Although parameter efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA have been explored for supervised adaptation, their effectiveness for SSA remains unknown. In this work, we introduce efficient self-supervised adaptation (ESSA), a framework that applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to SSA with the aim of reducing computational cost and improving adaptation performance. Among the methods tested, Attention Projection Layer Adaptation (APLA) sets a new state-of-the-art, consistently surpassing full-parameter SSA and supervised fine-tuning across diverse medical tasks, while reducing GPU memory by up to 40.1% and increasing training throughput by 25.2%, all while maintaining inference efficiency."

      "abstract": "While CNNs were long considered state of the art for image processing, the introduction of Transformer architectures has challenged this position. While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation."

      "abstract": "With the surge in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) reported in ClinVar in recent years, there is an imperative to resolve VUS at scale. Multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which allow the functional consequence of 100s to 1000s of genetic variants to be measured in a single experiment, are emerging as a source of evidence which can be used for clinical gene variant classification. Increasingly, there are multiple published MAVEs for the same gene, sometimes measuring different aspects of variant impact. Where multiple functional consequences may need to be considered to get a more complete understanding of variant effects for a given gene, combining data from multiple MAVEs may lead to the assignment of increased evidence strength which could impact variant classifications. Here, we provide guidance for combining such multiplexed functional data, incorporating a stepwise process from data curation and collection to model generation and validation. We illustrate the potential of this approach by showing the integration of multiplexed functional data from four MAVEs for the gene TP53. By following these steps, researchers can maximize the value of MAVEs, strengthen the functional evidence for clinical variant classification, reclassify more VUS, and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes."

      "abstract": "Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is a fundamental task in document understanding. However, existing DLA and adaptation methods often require access to large-scale source data and target labels. This requirements severely limiting their real-world applicability, particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained domains, such as financial statements, medical records, and proprietary business documents. According to our observation, directly transferring source-domain fine-tuned models on target domains often results in a significant performance drop (Avg. -32.64%). In this work, we introduce Source-Free Document Layout Analysis (SFDLA), aiming for adapting a pre-trained source DLA models to an unlabeled target domain, without access to any source data. To address this challenge, we establish the first SFDLA benchmark, covering three major DLA datasets for geometric- and content-aware adaptation. Furthermore, we propose Document Layout Analysis Adapter (DLAdapter), a novel framework that is designed to improve source-free adaptation across document domains. Our method achieves a +4.21% improvement over the source-only baseline and a +2.26% gain over existing source-free methods from PubLayNet to DocLayNet. We believe this work will inspire the DLA community to further investigate source-free document understanding. To support future research of the community, the benchmark, models, and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/s3setewe/sfdla-DLAdapter."

      "abstract": "Precise temperature measurement at micro/nanoscale is crucial across various domains including physical sciences, chemical processes, industrial production, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, electronics, and biology. Micro/nanoscale thermal mapping requires precise techniques such as thermocouples, resistance-based devices, infrared thermography, optical interferometry, Raman thermometry, and Time domain-thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. Each method has its advantages and limitations, emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate technique. Among these methods, micro-thin film thermocouples (TFTCs) offer a compelling solution due to their direct contact-based temperature measurements, minimal surface preparation requirements, lower cost, and robustness against environmental factors. Thermocouples work on the well-established Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated proportional to the temperature difference between two points. However, at micro/nanoscale, the Seebeck coefficients of thermocouples differ from those in bulk materials, requiring experimental calibration for precise measurements. To address this, we introduce an on-chip characterization platform with a differential temperature measurement setup on a borosilicate glass substrate. This platform utilizes a microheater as a localized heat source to elevate the temperature at the hot junction of the TFTC while maintaining the cold junction at ambient conditions. Numerical simulations are employed to engineer both the microheater and TFTC junction for precise temperature control. The functionality of this platform is validated by fabricating TFTCs using standard fabrication processes and measuring the TFTC response to determine the differential Seebeck coefficient of a Platinum-Chromium TFTC Junction. The calculated sensitivity of Pt/Cr TFTCs using this calibration method is 19.23 +- 0.405 {\\mu}V/C."

This study presents a numerical algorithm designed to simulate a previously established tumor model that incorporates various biological factors, including tumor cells, viable cells, necrotic cells, and the dynamics of MDE and ECM. The model consists of a system that includes a phase field equation, two reaction-diffusion equations, and two ordinary differential equations. We employ the fast exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (ETDRK) method with stabilizing terms to solve this system, resulting in a decoupled, explicit, linear numerical algorithm. The objective of this algorithm is to preserve the physical properties of the model variables, including the maximum bound principle (MBP) for nutrient concentration and MDE volume fraction, as well as bound preserving for ECM density and tumor volume fraction. We perform simulations of 2D and 3D tumor models {and discuss how different biological components impact growth dynamics. These simulations may help predict tumor evolution trends, offer insights for related biological and medical research,} potentially reduce the number and cost of experiments, and improve research efficiency."

      "abstract": "Imbalanced data represent a distribution with more frequencies of one class (majority) than the other (minority). This phenomenon occurs across various domains, such as security, medical care and human activity. In imbalanced learning, classification algorithms are typically inclined to classify the majority class accurately, resulting in artificially high accuracy rates. As a result, many minority samples are mistakenly labelled as majority-class instances, resulting in a bias that benefits the majority class. This study presents a framework based on boundary anchor samples to tackle the imbalance learning challenge. First, we select and use anchor samples to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, which acts as a prior knowledge model and aids the adversarial and contrastive learning procedures. Then, we designed a novel deep generative model called Anchor Stabilized Conditional Generative Adversarial Network or Anch-SCGAN in short. Anch-SCGAN is supported with two generators for the minority and majority classes and a discriminator incorporating additional class-specific information from the pre-trained feature extractor MLP. In addition, we facilitate the generator's training procedure in two ways. First, we define a new generator loss function based on reprocessed anchor samples and contrastive learning. Second, we apply a scoring strategy to stabilize the adversarial training part in generators. We train Anch-SCGAN and further finetune it with anchor samples to improve the precision of the generated samples. Our experiments on 16 real-world imbalanced datasets illustrate that Anch-SCGAN outperforms the renowned methods in imbalanced learning."

Nevertheless, it struggles to enter everyday clinical practice as an alternative and/or complement to Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Because of the minute-long hyperpolarization lifetime of the MR HP contrast agents, one of the reasons is, differently from PET, the need and financial burden to have the polarizing machine on site and, as close as possible to the MR scanner. In this work, we show that dDNP samples prepared with UV-induced labile radicals can bridge the technical gap with PET and provide MRI facilities with hours-long relaxing HP contrast agents. As a demonstration, we show the first across cities HP 13C-MRSI experiment in vivo and on a clinical scanner for a perfusion/angiography ([1-13C]HP001) and a metabolic ([U-13C, d7]glucose) contrast agent."
