      "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted that atypical brain development, particularly during infancy and toddlerhood, is linked to an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition, such as autism. Accurate brain tissue segmentations for morphological analysis are essential in numerous infant studies. However, due to ongoing white matter (WM) myelination changing tissue contrast in T1- and T2-weighted images, automatic tissue segmentation in 6-month infants is particularly difficult. On the other hand, manual labelling by experts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we propose the first 8-tissue segmentation pipeline for six-month-old infant brains. This pipeline utilizes domain adaptation (DA) techniques to leverage our longitudinal data, including neonatal images segmented with the neonatal Developing Human Connectome Project structural pipeline. Our pipeline takes raw 6-month images as inputs and generates the 8-tissue segmentation as outputs, forming an end-to-end segmentation pipeline. The segmented tissues include WM, gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ventricles, cerebellum, basal ganglia, brainstem, and hippocampus/amygdala. Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) and Attention U-Net were employed to achieve the image contrast transformation between neonatal and 6-month images and perform tissue segmentation on the synthesized 6-month images (neonatal images with 6-month intensity contrast), respectively. Moreover, we incorporated the segmentation outputs from Infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Toolbox (iBEAT) and another Attention U-Net to further enhance the performance and construct the end-to-end segmentation pipeline. Our evaluation with real 6-month images achieved a DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6, and an ASSD of 0.42."

It is responsible for reasoning and decision-making, while its evaluation is significant for the aviation domain in mitigating potential safety risks. Existing studies tend to use varied methods for cognitive state evaluation yet have limitations in timeliness, generalisation, and interpretability. Accordingly, this study adopts brain functional connectivity with electroencephalography signals to capture associations in brain regions across multiple subjects for evaluating real-time cognitive states. Specifically, a virtual reality-based flight platform is constructed with multi-screen embedded. Three distinctive cognitive tasks are designed and each has three degrees of difficulty. Thirty subjects are acquired for analysis and evaluation. The results are interpreted through different perspectives, including inner-subject and cross-subject for task-wise and gender-wise underlying brain functional connectivity. Additionally, this study incorporates questionnaire-based, task performance-based, and physiological measure-based approaches to fairly label the trials. A multi-class cognitive state evaluation is further conducted with the active brain connections. Benchmarking results demonstrate that the identified brain regions have considerable influences in cognition, with a multi-class accuracy rate of 95.83% surpassing existing studies. The derived findings bring significance to understanding the dynamic relationships among human brain functional regions, cross-subject cognitive behaviours, and decision-making, which have promising practical application values."

However, existing CV models often suffer a significant decrease in accuracy when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In contrast to these DNN models, human can maintain a consistently low error rate when facing OOD scenes, partly attributed to the rich prior cognitive knowledge stored in the human brain. Previous OOD generalization researches only focus on the single modal, overlooking the advantages of multimodal learning method. In this paper, we utilize the multimodal learning method to improve the OOD generalization and propose a novel Brain-machine Fusion Learning (BMFL) framework. We adopt the cross-attention mechanism to fuse the visual knowledge from CV model and prior cognitive knowledge from the human brain. Specially, we employ a pre-trained visual neural encoding model to predict the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) from visual features which eliminates the need for the fMRI data collection and pre-processing, effectively reduces the workload associated with conventional BMFL methods. Furthermore, we construct a brain transformer to facilitate the extraction of knowledge inside the fMRI data. Moreover, we introduce the Pearson correlation coefficient maximization regularization method into the training process, which improves the fusion capability with better constrains. Our model outperforms the DINOv2 and baseline models on the ImageNet-1k validation dataset as well as six curated OOD datasets, showcasing its superior performance in diverse scenarios."

However, current SNNs still fall short in terms of multi-scale temporal processing compared to their biological counterparts. This limitation has resulted in poor performance in many pattern recognition tasks with information that varies across different timescales. To address this issue, we put forward a novel spiking neuron model called Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron (PMSN). The PMSN emulates biological neurons by incorporating multiple interacting substructures and allows for flexible adjustment of the substructure counts to effectively represent temporal information across diverse timescales. Additionally, to address the computational burden associated with the increased complexity of the proposed model, we introduce two parallelization techniques that decouple the temporal dependencies of neuronal updates, enabling parallelized training across different time steps. Our experimental results on a wide range of pattern recognition tasks demonstrate the superiority of PMSN. It outperforms other state-of-the-art spiking neuron models in terms of its temporal processing capacity, training speed, and computation cost. Specifically, compared with the commonly used Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron, PMSN offers a simulation acceleration of over 10 $\\times$ and a 30 % improvement in accuracy on Sequential CIFAR10 dataset, while maintaining comparable computational cost."

      "abstract": "Gliomas, a common type of malignant brain tumor, present significant surgical challenges due to their similarity to healthy tissue. Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images are often ineffective during surgery due to factors such as brain shift, which alters the position of brain structures and tumors. This makes real-time intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) crucial, as it provides updated imaging that accounts for these shifts, ensuring more accurate tumor localization and safer resections. This paper presents a deep learning pipeline combining You Only Look Once Version 8 (YOLOv8) and Segment Anything Model Vision Transformer-base (SAM ViT-b) to enhance glioma detection and segmentation during ioMRI. Our model was trained using the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2021 (BraTS 2021) dataset, which includes standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, and noise-augmented MRI images that simulate ioMRI images. Noised MRI images are harder for a deep learning pipeline to segment, but they are more representative of surgical conditions. Achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DICE) score of 0.79, our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art segmentation models tested on noiseless data. This performance demonstrates the model's potential to assist surgeons in maximizing tumor resection and improving surgical outcomes."

      "abstract": "Bayesian learning provides a unified skeleton to solve the electrophysiological source imaging task. From this perspective, existing source imaging algorithms utilize the Gaussian assumption for the observation noise to build the likelihood function for Bayesian inference. However, the electromagnetic measurements of brain activity are usually affected by miscellaneous artifacts, leading to a potentially non-Gaussian distribution for the observation noise. Hence the conventional Gaussian likelihood model is a suboptimal choice for the real-world source imaging task. In this study, we aim to solve this problem by proposing a new likelihood model which is robust with respect to non-Gaussian noises. Motivated by the robust maximum correntropy criterion, we propose a new improper distribution model concerning the noise assumption. This new noise distribution is leveraged to structure a robust likelihood function and integrated with hierarchical prior distributions to estimate source activities by variational inference. In particular, the score matching is adopted to determine the hyperparameters for the improper likelihood model. A comprehensive performance evaluation is performed to compare the proposed noise assumption to the conventional Gaussian model. Simulation results show that, the proposed method can realize more precise source reconstruction by designing known ground-truth. The real-world dataset also demonstrates the superiority of our new method with the visual perception task. This study provides a new backbone for Bayesian source imaging, which would facilitate its application using real-world noisy brain signal."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan."

      "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the only non-invasive tool for studying white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the brain. These assessments rely heavily on tractography techniques, which reconstruct virtual streamlines representing white matter fibers. Much effort has been devoted to improving tractography methodology for adult brains, while tractography of the fetal brain has been largely neglected. Fetal tractography faces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly developing brain structures, and paucity of reference data. This work presents the first machine learning model for fetal tractography. The model input consists of five sources of information: (1) Fiber orientation, inferred from a diffusion tensor fit to the dMRI signal; (2) Directions of recent propagation steps; (3) Global spatial information, encoded as distances to keypoints in the brain cortex; (4) Tissue segmentation information; and (5) Prior information about the expected local fiber orientations supplied with an atlas. In order to mitigate the local tensor estimation error, a large spatial context around the current point in the diffusion tensor image is encoded using convolutional and attention neural network modules. Moreover, the diffusion tensor information at a hypothetical next point is included in the model input. Filtering rules based on anatomically constrained tractography are applied to prune implausible streamlines. We trained the model on manually-refined whole-brain fetal tractograms and validated the trained model on an independent set of 11 test scans with gestational ages between 23 and 36 weeks. Results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance across all evaluated tracts. The new method can significantly advance the capabilities of dMRI for studying normal and abnormal brain development in utero."

Brain states in single individuals defined by the patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions are used to create joint symbolic representations of the evolution of brain states in two or more individuals performing a task together. These symbolic dynamics can be analyzed to reveal aspects of the dynamics of joint brain states that are related to coordination or other interactive behaviors. We apply this approach to simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) data from pairs of subjects engaged in two different modes of finger-tapping coordination tasks (synchronization and syncopation) under different interaction conditions (Uncoupled, Leader-Follower, and Mutual) to explore the neural mechanisms of multi-person motor coordination. Our results reveal that the dyads exhibit mostly the same joint symbols in different interaction conditions - the most important differences are reflected in the symbolic dynamics. Recurrence analysis shows that interaction influences the dwell time in specific joint symbols and the structure of joint symbol sequences (motif length). In synchronization, increasing feedback promotes stability with longer dwell times and motif length. In syncopation, Leader-Follower interactions enhance stability (increase dwell time and motif length), but Mutual feedback dramatically reduces stability. Network analysis reveals distinct topological changes with task and feedback. In synchronization, stronger coupling stabilizes a few states restricting the pattern of flow between states, preserving a core-periphery structure of the joint brain states. In syncopation, a more distributed flow amongst a larger set of joint brain states reduces the dominance of core joint brain states."

However, not all continuously collected EEG signals are relevant or meaningful to the task at hand (e.g., wondering thoughts). On the other hand, manually labeling the relevant parts is nearly impossible due to varying engagement patterns across different tasks and individuals. Therefore, effectively and efficiently identifying the important parts from continuous EEG recordings is crucial for downstream BCI tasks, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep reinforcement learning framework, called Emotion-Agent, to automatically identify relevant and informative emotional moments from continuous EEG signals. Specifically, Emotion-Agent involves unsupervised deep reinforcement learning combined with a heuristic algorithm. We first use the heuristic algorithm to perform an initial global search and form prototype representations of the EEG signals, which facilitates the efficient exploration of the signal space and identify potential regions of interest. Then, we design distribution-prototype reward functions to estimate the interactions between samples and prototypes, ensuring that the identified parts are both relevant and representative of the underlying emotional states. Emotion-Agent is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve stable and efficient convergence. Our experiments compare the performance with and without Emotion-Agent. The results demonstrate that selecting relevant and informative emotional parts before inputting them into downstream tasks enhances the accuracy and reliability of aBCI applications."

In an effort to mitigate such risks, the concept of \"Alignment\" technology has been developed. However, recent studies indicate that this alignment can be undermined using sophisticated prompt engineering or adversarial suffixes, a technique known as \"Jailbreak.\" Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. Built upon this idea, we introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Previous studies have utilized various EEG features, such as subband power and connectivity patterns to differentiate these conditions. However, artifacts in EEG signals can obscure crucial information, necessitating advanced signal processing techniques. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. The study utilizes scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to check for the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (comprising AD, FTD, and healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (including subjects with AD, MCI, and HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes on both datasets.

LightCNN's strength lies in its simplicity, utilizing just a single convolutional layer. Embracing Leonardo da Vinci's principle that \"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\" LightCNN demonstrates that complexity is not required to achieve outstanding results. We benchmarked LightCNN against several state-of-the-art deep learning models known for their effectiveness in EEG-based PD classification. Remarkably, LightCNN outperformed all these complex architectures, with a 2.3% improvement in recall, a 4.6% increase in precision, a 0.1% edge in AUC, a 4% boost in F1-score, and a 3.3% higher accuracy compared to the closest competitor. Furthermore, LightCNN identifies known pathological brain rhythms associated with PD and effectively captures clinically relevant neurophysiological changes in EEG. Its simplicity and interpretability make it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded systems for EEG analysis. In conclusion, LightCNN represents a significant step forward in efficient EEG-based PD classification, demonstrating that a well-designed, lightweight model can achieve superior performance over more complex architectures.

      "abstract": "Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals are widely used in affective brain-computer interface (aBCI) applications. However, not all continuously collected EEG signals are relevant or meaningful to the task at hand (e.g., wondering thoughts). On the other hand, manually labeling the relevant parts is nearly impossible due to varying engagement patterns across different tasks and individuals. Therefore, effectively and efficiently identifying the important parts from continuous EEG recordings is crucial for downstream BCI tasks, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep reinforcement learning framework, called Emotion-Agent, to automatically identify relevant and informative emotional moments from continuous EEG signals. Specifically, Emotion-Agent involves unsupervised deep reinforcement learning combined with a heuristic algorithm. We first use the heuristic algorithm to perform an initial global search and form prototype representations of the EEG signals, which facilitates the efficient exploration of the signal space and identify potential regions of interest. Then, we design distribution-prototype reward functions to estimate the interactions between samples and prototypes, ensuring that the identified parts are both relevant and representative of the underlying emotional states. Emotion-Agent is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve stable and efficient convergence. Our experiments compare the performance with and without Emotion-Agent. The results demonstrate that selecting relevant and informative emotional parts before inputting them into downstream tasks enhances the accuracy and reliability of aBCI applications."

Although recent efforts have focused on using electroencephalography to detect drowsiness, helping prevent accidents caused by driving in such states, seamless human-machine interaction in driving scenarios requires a more versatile EEG-based system. This system should be capable of understanding a driver's intention while demonstrating resilience to artifacts induced by sudden movements. This paper pioneers a novel research direction in BCI-assisted driving, studying the neural patterns related to driving intentions and presenting a novel method for driving intention prediction. In particular, our preliminary analysis of the EEG signal using independent component analysis suggests a close relation between the intention of driving maneuvers and the neural activities in central-frontal and parietal areas. Power spectral density analysis at a group level also reveals a notable distinction among various driving intentions in the frequency domain. To exploit these brain dynamics, we propose a novel Masked EEG Modeling framework for predicting human driving intentions, including the intention for left turning, right turning, and straight proceeding. Extensive experiments, encompassing comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments on public dataset, demonstrate the proposed method is proficient in predicting driving intentions across various vigilance states. Specifically, our model attains an accuracy of 85.19% when predicting driving intentions for drowsy subjects, which shows its promising potential for mitigating traffic accidents related to drowsy driving. Notably, our method maintains over 75% accuracy when more than half of the channels are missing or corrupted, underscoring its adaptability in real-life driving."

      "abstract": "Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text."

One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads.

Previous OOD generalization researches only focus on the single modal, overlooking the advantages of multimodal learning method. In this paper, we utilize the multimodal learning method to improve the OOD generalization and propose a novel Brain-machine Fusion Learning (BMFL) framework. We adopt the cross-attention mechanism to fuse the visual knowledge from CV model and prior cognitive knowledge from the human brain. Specially, we employ a pre-trained visual neural encoding model to predict the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) from visual features which eliminates the need for the fMRI data collection and pre-processing, effectively reduces the workload associated with conventional BMFL methods. Furthermore, we construct a brain transformer to facilitate the extraction of knowledge inside the fMRI data. Moreover, we introduce the Pearson correlation coefficient maximization regularization method into the training process, which improves the fusion capability with better constrains.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan."

We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.",

Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

      "abstract": "Mammalian functional architecture flexibly adapts, transitioning from integration where information is distributed across the cortex, to segregation where information is focal in densely connected communities of brain regions. This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role."

In this paper, we present a new quantum-based approach named the Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates (HQCG) method for efficient understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum Control Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are designed to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively. Our method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum mechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals, such as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical methods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable and less prone to overfitting than the classical methods."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a currently incurable neurodegeneartive disease. Accurately detecting AD, especially in the early stage, represents a high research priority. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairments that are related to alterations in brain functional connectivity (FC). Based on this association, many studies have been published over the decades using FC and machine learning to differentiate AD from healthy aging. The most recent development in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network (GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack of spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI. The proposed multi-level generated connectome (MLC) based graph convolutional network (GCN) (MLC-GCN) contains a multi-graph generation block and a GCN prediction block. The multi-graph generation block consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature extraction layers for extracting spatio-temporal rsfMRI features at different depths and building the corresponding connectomes. The GCN prediction block takes the learned multi-level connectomes to build and optimize GCNs at each level and concatenates the learned graphical features as the final predicting features for AD classification. Through independent cohort validations, MLC-GCN shows better performance for differentiating MCI, AD, and normal aging than state-of-art GCN and rsfMRI based AD classifiers. The proposed MLC-GCN also showed high explainability in terms of learning clinically reasonable connectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets. While we only tested MLC-GCN on AD, the basic rsfMRI-based multi-level learned GCN based outcome prediction strategy is valid for other diseases or clinical outcomes."

This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal."

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering."

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

      "abstract": "Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "Digital pathology has advanced significantly over the last decade, with Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompassing vast amounts of data essential for accurate disease diagnosis. High-resolution WSIs are essential for precise diagnosis but technical limitations in scanning equipment and variablity in slide preparation can hinder obtaining these images. Super-resolution techniques can enhance low-resolution images; while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been effective in natural image super-resolution tasks, they often struggle with histopathology due to overfitting and mode collapse. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short in assessing the complex characteristics of histopathology images, necessitating robust histology-specific evaluation methods.   We introduce Histo-Diffusion, a novel diffusion-based method specially designed for generating and evaluating super-resolution images in digital pathology. It includes a restoration module for histopathology prior and a controllable diffusion module for generating high-quality images. We have curated two histopathology datasets and proposed a comprehensive evaluation strategy which incorporates both full-reference and no-reference metrics to thoroughly assess the quality of digital pathology images.   Comparative analyses on multiple datasets with state-of-the-art methods reveal that Histo-Diffusion outperforms GANs. Our method offers a versatile solution for histopathology image super-resolution, capable of handling multi-resolution generation from varied input sizes, providing valuable support in diagnostic processes."

In this work, we pioneer dynamic FFA video generation from static CF images. We introduce an autoregressive GAN for smooth, memory-saving frame-by-frame FFA synthesis. To enhance the focus on dynamic lesion changes in FFA regions, we design a knowledge mask based on clinical experience. Leveraging this mask, our approach integrates innovative knowledge mask-guided techniques, including knowledge-boosted attention, knowledge-aware discriminators, and mask-enhanced patchNCE loss, aimed at refining generation in critical areas and addressing the pixel misalignment challenge. Our method achieves the best FVD of 1503.21 and PSNR of 11.81 compared to other common video generation approaches. Human assessment by an ophthalmologist confirms its high generation quality. Notably, our knowledge mask surpasses supervised lesion segmentation masks, offering a promising non-invasive alternative to traditional FFA for research and clinical applications.

However, the opacity of AI systems raises concerns about essential characteristics needed in such sensitive applications, like transparency and trustworthiness. Our study addresses these concerns by investigating a process for selecting the most adequate Explainable AI (XAI) methods to comply with the explanation requirements of key EU regulations in the context of smart bioelectronics for medical devices. The adopted methodology starts with categorising smart devices by their control mechanisms (open-loop, closed-loop, and semi-closed-loop systems) and delving into their technology. Then, we analyse these regulations to define their explainability requirements for the various devices and related goals. Simultaneously, we classify XAI methods by their explanatory objectives. This allows for matching legal explainability requirements with XAI explanatory goals and determining the suitable XAI algorithms for achieving them. Our findings provide a nuanced understanding of which XAI algorithms align better with EU regulations for different types of medical devices. We demonstrate this through practical case studies on different neural implants, from chronic disease management to advanced prosthetics. This study fills a crucial gap in aligning XAI applications in bioelectronics with stringent provisions of EU regulations. It provides a practical framework for developers and researchers, ensuring their AI innovations advance healthcare technology and adhere to legal and ethical standards."

Recent studies have demonstrated their superior performance across various applications, including medical analysis and recommendation systems, often surpassing existing methods. However, GPUs often experience inefficiencies when executing HGNNs due to their unique and complex execution patterns. Compared to traditional Graph Neural Networks, these patterns further exacerbate irregularities in memory access. To tackle these challenges, recent studies have focused on developing domain-specific accelerators for HGNNs. Nonetheless, most of these efforts have concentrated on optimizing the datapath or scheduling data accesses, while largely overlooking the potential benefits that could be gained from leveraging the inherent properties of the semantic graph, such as its topology, layout, and generation.   In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance. First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation. Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN. This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts. Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\\times$."

      "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address issues of overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in the paradigm of self-supervised learning. Mainstream methods based on PEFT involve adding a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained parameters of the backbone fixed. These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone. Despite its success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization. We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity. Motivated by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework based on Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP). The target parameters refer to the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning. TPP includes an additional stage before PEFT to pre-train these target parameters. During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the target parameters are trainable. A defined pre-text task is used to encourage the target parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data. When PEFT is subsequently employed, the pre-trained target parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency. The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing for the integration of various pretext tasks for pre-training and supporting different PEFT methods as backbones. We evaluated the fine-tining performance of our method using five public datasets, including three modalities and two task types. The results demonstrate that the proposed TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance."

Recent multimodal text-image supervised foundation models offer new solutions to data scarcity through effective representation learning. However, their limited medical-specific pretraining hinders their performance in medical image classification relative to natural images. To address this issue, we propose a novel Text-guided Foundation model Adaptation for Long-Tailed medical image classification (TFA-LT). We adopt a two-stage training strategy, integrating representations from the foundation model using just two linear adapters and a single ensembler for balanced outcomes. Experimental results on two long-tailed medical image datasets validate the simplicity, lightweight and efficiency of our approach: requiring only 6.1% GPU memory usage of the current best-performing algorithm, our method achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 27.1%, highlighting the substantial potential of foundation model adaptation in this area."

Compared with DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequential-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make a broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs and can be directly implemented into conventional CT systems. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material basis image reconstruction approaches assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification of material concentration. In this work, we developed sequential-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and error-compensated material basis image generation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially scanned data sets and improve quantification accuracy of material concentration in sequential-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams and experimental human subject studies. Results demonstrated the improvement of quantification accuracy and image quality using ACCELERATION."
