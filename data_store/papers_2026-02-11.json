      "abstract": "Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.",

Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension.

Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of 10 deep learning models to simulate common DA techniques and explore their application in four medical image datasets. We have considered various situations such as multi-modality, noisy data, federated learning (FL), interpretability analysis, and classifier calibration. The experimental results indicate that using DA with ResNet34 in a brain tumor (BT) data set results in an enhancement of 4.7\\% in model performance. Similarly, the use of DA can reduce the impact of Gaussian noise, as it provides $\\sim 3\\%$ accuracy increase using ResNet34 on a BT dataset. Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\\sim 0.3\\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification.

      "abstract": "Comparing representations across neural networks is challenging because representations admit symmetries, such as arbitrary reordering of units or rotations of activation space, that obscure underlying equivalence between models. We introduce a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out these nuisance symmetries to construct a universal embedding space across many models. Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison. Together, these results show that resolving representational similarity at the level of individual stimuli reveals phenomena that cannot be detected by set-level comparison metrics.",

This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints.

However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls.

A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model).

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.",

To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of 20% in F1 score and reductions of 88% in inference latency.

Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $\u03b5_c(\u03b3,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit.

      "abstract": "Neural control of grasping arises from nonlinear interactions across multiple brain rhythms, yet EEG-based motor decoding has largely relied on linear, second-order spectral features. Here, we examine whether higher-order cross-frequency dynamics distinguish motor planning from execution during natural reach-to-grasp behavior. EEG was recorded in a cue-based paradigm during executed precision and power grips, enabling stage-resolved analysis of preparatory and execution-related neural activity.   Cross-frequency bispectral analysis was used to compute bicoherence matrices across canonical frequency band pairs, from which magnitude- and phase-based features were extracted. Classification, permutation-based feature selection, and within-subject statistical testing showed that execution is characterized by substantially stronger and more discriminative nonlinear coupling than planning, with dominant contributions from beta- and gamma-driven interactions. In contrast, decoding of precision versus power grips achieved comparable performance during planning and execution, indicating that grasp-type representations emerge during planning and persist into execution.   Spatial and spectral analyses further revealed that informative bispectral features reflect coordinated activity across prefrontal, central, and occipital regions. Despite substantial feature redundancy, effective dimensionality reduction preserved decoding performance. Together, these findings demonstrate that nonlinear cross-frequency coupling provides an interpretable and robust marker of motor planning and execution, extending bispectral EEG analysis to ecologically valid grasping and supporting its relevance for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetic control.",

We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes of story, 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without losing accuracy.",

SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets.

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.",

Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.",

This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.",

Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines.

We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions.

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling.",

We identified a geometric modularization where layers self-organize into stable low- and high-complexity clusters.

This alignment followed heterogeneous spatial-temporal trajectories: rapid and stable in temporal regions (AntTemp, PostTemp), but delayed and dynamic in frontal areas (IFG, IFGorb).

We propose SpARCD (Spectral Analysis of Revealing Connectivity Differences), a novel statistical framework for detecting differences in brain connectivity between two experimental conditions. SpARCD leverages distance correlation, a dependence measure sensitive to both linear and nonlinear associations, to construct a weighted graph for each condition. It then constructs a differential operator via spectral filtering and uncovers connectivity changes by computing its leading eigenvectors. Inference is achieved via a permutation-based testing scheme that yields interpretable, region-level significance maps. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that SpARCD achieves superior power relative to conventional edge-wise or univariate approaches, particularly in the presence of complex dependency structures. Application to fMRI data from 113 early PTSD patients performing an emotional face-matching task reveals distinct networks associated with emotional reactivity and regulatory processes.

We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

However, modeling the causal forward evolution in realistic neural simulation is impeded by the timescale mismatch between multimodal inputs and the complex topology of cortical networks. To address these challenges, we introduce BrainVista, a multimodal autoregressive framework designed to model the causal evolution of brain states. BrainVista incorporates Network-wise Tokenizers to disentangle system-specific dynamics and a Spatial Mixer Head that captures inter-network information flow without compromising functional boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a novel Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism to synchronize high-frequency sensory stimuli with hemodynamically filtered signals, enabling strict, history-only causal conditioning. We validate our framework on Algonauts 2025, CineBrain, and HAD, achieving state-of-the-art fMRI encoding performance.

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.",

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.",

The compact room-temperature NV sensors exhibit sensitivities of 6-26 pT/Hz^(1/2) with active sensing volumes below 0.5 mm^3, defining the performance level of the demonstrated MCG measurements. While the present signals are obtained by averaging, this performance already indicates a clear path toward single-shot MCG sensing. To move beyond shielded environments toward practical clinical use, strong noise suppression is required. To this end, we implement NV-based gradiometry and achieve efficient common-mode noise rejection, enabled by the intrinsically small sensing volume of NV sensors. Together, these multi-platform results obtained across diverse magnetic environments provide a solid foundation for translating quantum sensors into human medical diagnostics such as MCG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).",

Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems.

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

      "abstract": "Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space.

Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process.

      "abstract": "Objective: To validate a novel inter-electrode PWV method that directly measures pulse wave propagation between spatially separated electrodes, avoiding LVET estimation. Methods: We analyzed 43 multi-channel ECG recordings (3 channels, 1000 Hz) from the FELICITy 2 cohort (pregnant women, $\\sim$19 and $\\sim$35 weeks gestation). R-peaks were detected independently on each channel using an ensemble detector. Time lags ($\u0394t$) between matched R-peaks on electrode pairs were calculated, and PWV computed as PWV = $L$/$\u0394t$, where $L$ is an effective inter-electrode distance. Three channel pairs provided independent PWV estimates per recording. Temporal stability was assessed using sliding window analysis (1--15 minutes). To investigate whether $\u0394t$ reflects morphological distortion or vascular propagation, we performed signal origin analysis using three QRS fiducial points (R-peak maximum, QRS onset, maximum $|dV/dt|$) and two bandpass settings (0.5--40 and 0.5--100~Hz). Longitudinal changes were compared between Control (n=24) and prenatal Yoga intervention (n=20) groups. Results: Inter-electrode PWV yielded physiologically plausible values (Control First: 7.40$\\pm$1.51 m/s, Control Last: 6.98$\\pm$1.63 m/s; Yoga First: 7.10$\\pm$2.15 m/s, Yoga Last: 8.16$\\pm$0.91 m/s), consistent with literature values for aortic PWV (5--10 m/s). Temporal stability analysis demonstrated PWV stabilizes at 5 minutes (CV=12.3\\%), with 2.6--5.2$\\times$ better stability than heart rate and HRV metrics. Signal origin analysis showed that inter-electrode delays persisted across all QRS fiducial points (15--27~ms) and were insensitive to bandpass changes ($-$8.5\\%, NS), arguing against pure morphological distortion; all conditions yielded PWV within 6.8--9.1~m/s. Preliminary group comparison suggests different trajectories (Control: --5.7\\% decrease, Yoga: +14.9\\% increase, p=0.07 for interaction). Conclusions: Inter-electrode PWV provides direct spatial measurement of pulse wave propagation with physiologically valid values, independent of LVET estimation. Signal origin analysis supports the robustness of this empirical surrogate across fiducial and filter conditions. Method shows promise for pregnancy arterial stiffness assessment using standard multi-channel ECG equipment. Further validation against gold-standard measures and accurate electrode distance determination are needed.",

Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.",

Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.",

The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration.
