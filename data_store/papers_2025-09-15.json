      "abstract": "Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.",

      "abstract": "We solve exactly the non-equilibrium dynamics of two discrete random walkers moving in channels with transition rates $p \\neq q$ that swap positions at a rate $s$. We compute exactly the joint probability distribution $P_{n,m}(t)$ for the walkers, revealing the existence of two dynamical crossovers. The first signals the passage from independent diffusion to a swap-dominated regime where the particles act as identical random walkers swapping positions. The second crossover occurs when both channels become indistinguishable and the walkers move around the same position. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a persistent spatial anisotropy defined by the difference between the second moments of the probability distributions in the two channels. Our results may provide a quantitative framework to understand diverse systems. In biology, it is motivated by motor proteins (kinesin/dynein) exchanging cargo leadership, membrane receptors swapping binding partners, or brain synapses with activity-dependent plasticity. In finance, it models traders with distinct risk profiles swapping positions in limit-order books, or volatility spillover between coupled markets. These diverse systems share a unifying theme: exchange processes mediate macroscopic correlations despite individual heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks. Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at https://github.com/acharaakshit/ShortMR",

This study introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity, our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80 for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture, approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health systems.

      "abstract": "Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged, MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information. This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities, and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple, thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI, DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training, while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that addresses key limitations of current approaches.

Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most comparisons.

Polyimide film, known as Kapton, serves as a flexible substrate for microelectrodes, conductive tracks, and contact pads of the probe, which are made from a thin film of gold (Au). SU-8 is used to cover the corresponding tracks for electrical isolation and to increase the stiffness of the probe for better implantation. To evaluate the performance of the fabricated probe, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and artificial neural signal recording have been used to characterize its properties. The microelectrode dimensions have been carefully chosen to provide low impedance characteristics, which are necessary for acquiring local field potential (LFP) signals. The in vivo LFP data have been obtained from a male zebra finch presented with auditory stimuli. By properly filtering the extracellular recordings and analyzing the data, the obtained results have been validated by comparing them with the signals acquired with a commercial neural electrode. Due to the use of Kapton, SU-8, and Au materials with non-toxic and adaptable properties in the body environment, the fabricated neural probe is considered a promising biocompatible implantable neural probe that may pave the way for the fabrication of other neural implantable devices with commercial aims.",

Since Marmosets communicate primarily through vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data, alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity.

Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets, fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

      "abstract": "3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses, particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature. This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences.",

We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis.

The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers.

This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR.

Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional dimensions of empathy.

      "abstract": "The phase locking value (PLV) is a widely used measure to detect phase connectivity. Main drawbacks of the standard PLV are it can be sensitive to noisy observations and does not provide uncertainty measures under finite samples. To overcome the difficulty, we propose a model-based PLV through nonparametric statistical modeling. Specifically, since the discrete time series of phase can be regarded as a functional observation taking values on circle, we employ a Bayesian model for circular-variate functional data, which gives denoising and inference on the resulting PLV values. The proposed model is defined through \"wrapping\" functional Gaussian models on real line, for which we develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm using Gibbs sampler. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation experiments based on real EEG data.",

To develop measurable variables aligned with this framework, we introduce \"feelings of agency\" (FoA) as an alternative to the established construct of \"sense of agency\" (SoA), refining Synofzyk's multifactorial weighting model and offering a novel conceptual pathway for overcoming gaps in the dominant comparator model. We define FoA as comprising two subconstructs: affective engagement and volitional attention, which we operationalize through integrated neurodynamic indicators (valence, arousal, cross frequency coupling within the dorsal attention system) and first-person phenomenological reports. We argue that these neurophenomenological indicators provide richer, more actionable insights for digital affordance design, particularly in XR, BCI, Human AI Interaction (HAX), and generative AI environments.

This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360{\\deg} cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid EEG+gaze systems for everyday VR use, highlighting their ergonomic benefits and inclusivity potential. Although not yet competitive in speed, NeuroGaze points toward a practical role for consumer-grade BCIs in accessibility and long-duration applications, and underscores the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the 26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific patterns in the dataset. Subsequently, four convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained for EEG classification.

However, the current transfer learning model greatly depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\\%, 68.11\\% and 61.08\\%, respectively.

Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model.

For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms.

It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\\%, 59.88\\%, and 59.56\\%, respectively.

This model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant information, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in specific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal set of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the cognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that allow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal component, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely to be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which integrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity framework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply the models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and emotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity ranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification performance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\\% improvement in cross-validated deviance $R^2$ and 7.3\\% improvement in cross-validated AUC.

      "abstract": "Mean-field models provide a link between microscopic neuronal activity and macroscopic brain dynamics. Their derivation depends on simplifying assumptions, such as all-to-all connectivity, limiting their biological realism. To overcome this, we introduce a data-driven framework in which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns the macroscopic dynamics directly from simulations of a network of spiking neurons. The network connection probability serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment, which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical model. For validation, we use simulation-based inference on synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate accurate parameter recovery for the novel mean-field model, while the current state-of-the-art models lead to biased estimates. This work presents a flexible and generic framework for building more realistic whole-brain models, bridging the gap between microscale mechanisms and macroscopic brain recordings.",

To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem.

Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation.

We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks.

However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices.

The global Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively.

While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms.

In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

      "abstract": "Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior.

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.",

Accurate range estimation is essential, but planning still relies on X-ray CT, which introduces uncertainty in stopping power and range. Proton CT measures water equivalent thickness directly but suffers resolution loss from multiple Coulomb scattering. We develop a data driven method that reconstructs water equivalent path length (WEPL) maps from energy resolved proton radiographs, bypassing intermediate reconstructions. Approach. We present a machine learning pipeline for WEPL from high dimensional radiographs. Data were generated with the TOPAS Monte Carlo toolkit, modeling a clinical nozzle and a patient CT. Proton energies spanned 70-230 MeV across 72 projection angles. Principal component analysis reduced input dimensionality while preserving signal. A conditional GAN with gradient penalty was trained for WEPL prediction using a composite loss (adversarial, MSE, SSIM, perceptual) to balance sharpness, accuracy, and stability. Main results. The model reached a mean relative WEPL deviation of 2.5 percent, an SSIM of 0.97, and a proton radiography gamma index passing rate of 97.1 percent (2 percent delta WEPL, 3 mm distance-to-agreement) on a simulated head phantom. Results indicate high spatial fidelity and strong structural agreement. Significance. WEPL can be mapped directly from proton radiographs with deep learning while avoiding intermediate steps. The method mitigates limits of analytic techniques and may improve treatment planning. Future work will tune the number of PCA components, include detector response, explore low dose settings, and extend multi angle data toward full proton CT reconstruction; it is compatible with clinical workflows.",

The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes without loss of parameter fidelity.

Multi-modal medical image fusion integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling.

We compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics.
