      "abstract": "This paper studies the data-driven control of unknown linear-threshold network dynamics to stabilize the state to a reference value. We consider two types of controllers: (i) a state feedback controller with feed-forward reference input and (ii) an augmented feedback controller with error integration. The first controller features a simpler structure and is easier to design, while the second offers improved performance in the presence of system parameter changes and disturbances. Our design strategy employs state-input datasets to construct data-based representations of the closed-loop dynamics. Since these representations involve linear threshold functions, we rewrite them as switched linear systems, and formulate the design problem as that of finding a common controller for all the resulting modes. This gives rise to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose solutions corresponds to the controller gain matrices. We analyze the computational complexity of solving the LMIs and propose a simplified, sufficient set of conditions that scales linearly with the system state. Simulations on two case studies involving regulation of firing rate dynamics in rodent brains and of arousal level dynamics in humans demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designs."

      "abstract": "Perception systems in robotics encounter significant challenges in high-speed and dynamic conditions when relying on traditional cameras, where motion blur can compromise spatial feature integrity and task performance. Brain-inspired vision sensors (BVS) have recently gained attention as an alternative, offering high temporal resolution with reduced bandwidth and power requirements. Here, we present the first quantitative evaluation framework for two representative classes of BVSs in variable-speed robotic sensing, including event-based vision sensors (EVS) that detect asynchronous temporal contrasts, and the primitive-based sensor Tianmouc that employs a complementary mechanism to encode both spatiotemporal changes and intensity. A unified testing protocol is established, including crosssensor calibrations, standardized testing platforms, and quality metrics to address differences in data modality. From an imaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as motion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For functional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and motion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS performs well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex scenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings due to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In comparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and complex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise, high-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable insights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and support further advancement in this area."

      "abstract": "Spontaneous waves are ubiquitous during early brain development and are hypothesized to drive the development of receptive fields (RFs). Different stages of spontaneous waves in the retina have been observed to coincide with the development of the retinotopic map, ON-OFF segregation, and orientation selectivity in the early visual pathway of mammals, and can be characterized by different activity patterns in the retina and downstream areas. Stage II waves, which occur in rodents right after birth, have been implicated in a possible synaptic pruning process, relating these stage II retinal waves to the refinement of the retinotopic map. However, the mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent effects of retinal waves on primary visual cortex (V1) are poorly understood. In this work, we build a biologically-constrained model of the development of thalamocortical synapses onto neurons in V1 driven by stage II retinal waves using a spike-timing dependent triplet learning rule. Using this model, together with a reduced rate-based model, we propose possible mechanisms underlying such a pruning process and predict how characteristics of the retinal waves may lead to different RF structures, including periodic RFs. We introduce gap junctions into the V1 network and show that such a coupling can serve to promote precise local retinotopy. Finally, we discuss how the spatial distribution of synaptic weights at the end of stage II may affect the emergence of orientation selectivity of V1 neurons during stage III waves. The mechanisms uncovered in this work may be useful in understanding synaptic structures that emerge across cortical regions during development."

Second, augmentation studies in medical imaging are fragmented and limited to single tasks or architectures, leaving the benefits of advanced mix-based strategies unclear. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework with six mix-based augmentation methods integrated with both convolutional and transformer backbones on brain tumour MRI and eye disease fundus datasets. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We introduce MediAug, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark for advanced data augmentation in medical imaging.

A designed cost function guides the search, and the configurations are tuned using a TOPSIS-based multicriteria decision making process. BRADO consistently outperforms alternatives in terms of solution quality, achieving fewer threats and better objective function values. To assess BRADO's efficacy, it is benchmarked against several established metaheuristic algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), and basic Local Search (LS). The study highlights BRADO's potential as a general-purpose solver for combinatorial problems, opening pathways for future applications in other domains of artificial intelligence."

While modern machine learning has significantly advanced our understanding of neural processing mechanisms through these datasets, decoding task-specific signatures must contend with inherent neuroimaging constraints, for example, low signal-to-noise ratios in raw electrophysiological recordings, cross-session non-stationarity, and limited sample sizes. This review focuses on machine learning approaches for covariance-based neuroimaging data, where often symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices under full-rank conditions encode inter-channel relationships. By equipping the space of SPD matrices with Riemannian metrics (e.g., affine-invariant or log-Euclidean), their space forms a Riemannian manifold enabling geometric analysis. We unify methodologies operating on this manifold under the SPD learning framework, which systematically leverages the SPD manifold's geometry to process covariance features, thereby advancing brain imaging analytics."

However, high-performing neural networks invariably display non-linear behaviours, which is diametrically opposed to the linear evolution of closed quantum systems. We propose a solution to this issue and report the first neuromorphic architecture based on a photonic quantum memristor. In detail, we show how the memristive feedback loop enhances the non-linearity and hence the performance of the algorithm. We benchmark our model on two tasks, i.e. non-linear function and time series prediction. In these cases, we highlight the essential role of the quantum memristive element and demonstrate the possibility of using it as a building block in more sophisticated networks."

To address these challenges, we propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates multiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large language model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models. The results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned vision-language model inputs with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM to create a robust, secure, and highly accurate diagnostic system for mild TBI prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first application of fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM for TBI prediction tasks."

While T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals. Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for neurodegeneration in T2w MRI."

Yet, capturing emotions in face-to-face contexts remains challenging due to subtle nonverbal cues, variations in personal traits, and the real-time dynamics of genuine interactions. Existing emotion recognition datasets often rely on limited modalities or controlled conditions, thereby missing the richness and variability found in real-world scenarios.   In this work, we introduce Advancing Face-to-Face Emotion Communication (AFFEC), a multimodal dataset designed to address these gaps. AFFEC encompasses 84 simulated emotional dialogues across six distinct emotions, recorded from 73 participants over more than 5,000 trials and annotated with more than 20,000 labels. It integrates electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, galvanic skin response (GSR), facial videos, and Big Five personality assessments. Crucially, AFFEC explicitly distinguishes between felt emotions (the participant's internal affect) and perceived emotions (the observer's interpretation of the stimulus).   Baseline analyses spanning unimodal features and straightforward multimodal fusion demonstrate that even minimal processing yields classification performance significantly above chance, especially for arousal. Incorporating personality traits further improves predictions of felt emotions, highlighting the importance of individual differences. By bridging controlled experimentation with more realistic face-to-face stimuli, AFFEC offers a unique resource for researchers aiming to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and personalized emotion recognition models."

This paper proposes a dynamic code understandability assessment method, which estimates a personalized code understandability score from the perspective of the specific programmer handling the code. The method consists of dynamically dividing the code unit under development or review in code regions (invisible to the programmer) and using the number of revisits (NRevisit) to each region as the primary feature for estimating the code understandability score. This approach removes the uncertainty related to the concept of a \"typical programmer\" assumed by static software code complexity metrics and can be easily implemented using a simple, low-cost, and non-intrusive desktop eye tracker or even a standard computer camera. This metric was evaluated using cognitive load measured through electroencephalography (EEG) in a controlled experiment with 35 programmers. Results show a very high correlation ranging from rs = 0.9067 to rs = 0.9860 (with p nearly 0) between the scores obtained with different alternatives of NRevisit and the ground truth represented by the EEG measurements of programmers' cognitive load, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in reflecting the cognitive effort required for code comprehension. The paper also discusses possible practical applications of NRevisit, including its use in the context of AI-generated code, which is already widely used today."

This study aims to distinguish the modified state of consciousness experienced during Rajyoga meditation from the resting state of the brain in a subject-independent manner using EEG data. Three architectures have been proposed and evaluated: The CSP-LDA Architecture utilizes common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM Architecture employs CSP for feature extraction, LDA for dimensionality reduction, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for classification, modeling the binary classification problem as a sequence learning problem. The SVD-NN Architecture uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to select the most relevant components of the EEG signals and a shallow neural network (NN) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM architecture gives the best performance with 98.2% accuracy for intra-subject classification. The SVD-NN architecture provides significant performance with 96.4\\% accuracy for inter-subject classification. This is comparable to the best-reported accuracies in the literature for intra-subject classification. Both architectures are capable of capturing subject-invariant EEG features for effectively classifying the meditative state from the resting state. The high intra-subject and inter-subject classification accuracies indicate these systems' robustness and their ability to generalize across different subjects."

The diagnosis of epilepsy relies heavily on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, where specialists manually analyze epileptiform patterns across pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, and interictal periods. However, the manual analysis of EEG signals is prone to variability between experts, emphasizing the need for automated solutions. Although previous studies have explored preprocessing techniques and machine learning approaches for seizure detection, there is a gap in understanding how the representation of EEG data (time, frequency, or time-frequency domains) impacts the predictive performance of deep learning models. This work addresses this gap by systematically comparing deep neural networks trained on EEG data in these three domains. Through the use of statistical tests, we identify the optimal data representation and model architecture for epileptic seizure detection. The results demonstrate that frequency-domain data achieves detection metrics exceeding 97\\%, providing a robust foundation for more accurate and reliable seizure detection systems."

It is unclear if and how seizure severity is modulated over longer timescales. Characterising seizure severity variability over time could lead to tailored treatments. In this study, we test if continuously-recorded interictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) features encapsulate signatures of such modulations.   Methods We analysed 20 subjects with iEEG recordings of at least one day. We identified cycles on timescales of hours to days embedded in long-term iEEG band power and associated them with seizure severity, which we approximated using seizure duration. In order to quantify these associations, we created linear-circular statistical models of seizure duration that incorporated different band power cycles within each subject.   Findings In most subjects, seizure duration was weakly to moderately correlated with individual band power cycles. Combinations of multiple band power cycles significantly explained most of the variability in seizure duration. Specifically, we found 70% of the models had a higher than 60% adjusted $R^2$ across all subjects. From these models, around 80% were deemed to be above chance-level (p-value < 0.05) based on permutation tests. Models included cycles of ultradian, circadian and slower timescales in a subject-specific manner.   Interpretation These results suggest that seizure severity, as measured by seizure duration, may be modulated over timescales of minutes to days by subject-specific cycles in interictal iEEG signal properties. These cycles likely serve as markers of seizure modulating processes. Future work can investigate biological drivers of these detected fluctuations and may inform novel treatment strategies that minimise seizure severity."

However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities.

This classifier is simple, fully deterministic, robust to noise, computationally efficient, and prone to transfer learning. Its training is very simple, requiring just the computation of a geometric mean of a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix per class. We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior.

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%."

This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches."

At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers."

Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays.

But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data."

Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures.\" We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods."

However, neuroimaging such as fMRI contains complex spatio-temporal features, which makes the corresponding representations susceptible to a variety of distractions, thus leading to less effective in CAD. For the first time, we present a Comorbidity-Informed Transfer Learning(CITL) framework for diagnosing neuro-developmental disorders using fMRI. In CITL, a new reinforced representation generation network is proposed, which first combines transfer learning with pseudo-labelling to remove interfering patterns from the temporal domain of fMRI and generates new representations using encoder-decoder architecture. The new representations are then trained in an architecturally simple classification network to obtain CAD model. In particular, the framework fully considers the comorbidity mechanisms of neuro-developmental disorders and effectively integrates them with semi-supervised learning and transfer learning, providing new perspectives on interdisciplinary. Experimental results demonstrate that CITL achieves competitive accuracies of 76.32% and 73.15% for detecting autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively, which outperforms existing related transfer learning work for 7.2% and 0.5% respectively."

These factors contribute to the diminished effectiveness of representation learning, which in turn affects the overall efficacy of subsequent classification procedures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-site adversarial learning network (MSalNET) for fMRI-based mental disorder detection. Firstly, a representation learning module is introduced with a node information assembly (NIA) mechanism to better extract features from functional connectivity (FC). This mechanism aggregates edge information from both horizontal and vertical directions, effectively assembling node information. Secondly, to generalize the feature across sites, we proposed a site-level feature extraction module that can learn from individual FC data, which circumvents additional prior information. Lastly, an adversarial learning network is proposed as a means of balancing the trade-off between individual classification and site regression tasks, with the introduction of a novel loss function. The proposed method was evaluated on two multi-site fMRI datasets, i.e., Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and ADHD-200. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than other related algorithms with the accuracy of 75.56 and 68.92 in ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the result of the site regression indicates that the proposed method reduces site variability from a data-driven perspective. The most discriminative brain regions revealed by NIA are consistent with statistical findings, uncovering the \"black box\" of deep learning to a certain extent."

To address individual differences, researchers often use source subject data, which leads to issues such as privacy leakage and heavy data storage burdens. In modality alignment, current works focus on aligning the softmax probability distribution but neglect the alignment of marginal probability distributions, resulting in modality misalignment. Additionally, images and text are aligned separately with fMRI without considering the complex interplay between images and text, leading to poor image reconstruction. Finally, the enormous dimensionality of CLIP embeddings causes significant computational costs. Although the dimensionality of CLIP embeddings can be reduced by ignoring the number of patches obtained from images and the number of tokens acquired from text, this comes at the cost of a significant drop in model performance, creating a dilemma. To overcome these limitations, we propose a source-free domain adaptation-based brain decoding framework."

The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\\tau\\to \\mu\\gamma$, $\\tau\\to e\\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$."

We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis.

However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume.

For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision."

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

We used multiple health centers' artificial intelligence and radiology data, focused on different tasks that looked at prostate cancer detection using MRI (PI-CAI). We utilized Knowledge Distillation (KD), as it employs generated images from past tasks to guide the training of models for subsequent tasks. The approach yielded improved performance and faster convergence of the models. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach, we evaluated it on the PI-CAI dataset, a diverse set of medical imaging modalities including OCT and PathMNIST, and the benchmark continual learning dataset CIFAR-10. Our results indicate that KD can be a promising technique for IL in medical image analysis in which data is sourced from individual health centers and the storage of large datasets is not feasible. By using generated images from prior tasks, our method enables the model to retain and apply previously acquired knowledge without direct access to the original data."

      "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of the beam temporal profile on the radical dynamics and inter-track interactions of FLASH radiotherapy, supporting parameter optimization for the equipment development and clinical implementation. Methods: MonteCarlo simulations based on the IRT method were performed to analyze the dynamics after irradiation, including single-pulse or multi-pulses irradiation, pulse repetition rate, width and dose. The physicochemical experiments were performed to measure the eaq-lifetimes for validation. The generation and recombination of OH and eaq-radicals were recorded under 6 MeV electron irradiation with varying beam temporal profiles. The radial distributions of the radicals were statistically analyzed, and the corresponding LETd and LETt were calculated. The inter-track interactions were assessed through a mathematical model. Results: The spatial distribution and temporal evolution of radicals were significantly affected by the beam time profiles. Compared with multi-pulses irradiation, single-pulse mode with a width less than 1/10 of the radical lifetime, a repetition interval longer than the radical lifetime, and a dose exceeding 1 Gy/pulse can lead to radicals rapid consumption, reducing the residual content. Instantaneous high dose rates induced radical tracks overlaps. When the single-pulse dose exceeded 1 Gy, the overlap probability approached 100%, aligning with the threshold for radical instantaneous combination. Conclusion: Under a low-duty cycle and high instantaneous dose-rate time profile, the radicals were rapidly consumed through track overlap hence reduced damage to normal tissues, inducing FLASH effect. The optimized time profile can be used to guide the development of equipment and parameter settings in clinical practice to maximize the FLASH effect, such as the laser accelerators and superconducting photocathode guns."

      "abstract": "Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more comprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical imaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with large-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view Visual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening mammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on high-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature learning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively tunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\\%) while retaining the robustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration of multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods, providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution mammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while maintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for distinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights the potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable solution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection."

      "abstract": "Purpose: The scarcity of high-quality curated labeled medical training data remains one of the major limitations in applying artificial intelligence (AI) systems to breast cancer diagnosis. Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass (or micro-calcification) detection require training with a large volume of labeled images, which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. To reduce this challenge, we proposed a novel method that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named \\textbf{HybMNet}, which combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to enhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms.   Approach: Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL Pretraining: We utilize EsViT, a SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer (Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms. The pretrained Swin-T then serves as the backbone for the downstream task. (2) Downstream Training: The proposed HybMNet combines the Swin-T backbone with a CNN-based network and a novel fusion strategy. The Swin-T employs local self-attention to identify informative patch regions from the high-resolution mammogram, while the CNN-based network extracts fine-grained local features from the selected patches. A fusion module then integrates global and local information from both networks to generate robust predictions. The HybMNet is trained end-to-end, with the loss function combining the outputs of the Swin-T and CNN modules to optimize feature extraction and classification performance.   Results: The proposed method was evaluated for its ability to detect breast cancer by distinguishing between benign (normal) and malignant mammograms. Leveraging SSL pretraining and the HybMNet model, it achieved AUC of 0.864 (95% CI: 0.852, 0.875) on the CMMD dataset and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.875, 0.903) on the INbreast dataset, highlighting its effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments indicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and more consistent and reliable LLM outputs."

In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for medical imaging task."

In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes, such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets, including \\textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical step towards AI safety in healthcare.

Addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training."

However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding."
