      "abstract": "Tractography algorithms leverage diffusion MRI to reconstruct the fibrous architecture of the brain's white matter. Among machine learning approaches, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for tractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects. TractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by incorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based mechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original TractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate their performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results demonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads to robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or dataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative Reward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages bundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout training. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle feedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms of accuracy and anatomical validity."

      "abstract": "Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary insights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis, using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs. multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems."

      "abstract": "Learning new information without forgetting prior knowledge is central to human intelligence. In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic forgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain has distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and pattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture these complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization capabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage properties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally plausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST task, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to state-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting. Representational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the VAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By capturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work provides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation, generalization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial systems."

      "abstract": "Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its \"1000CE\" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not)."

We convert this wiring diagram into a Biological Processing Unit (BPU), a fixed recurrent network derived directly from synaptic connectivity. Despite its modest size 3,000 neurons and 65,000 weights between them), the unmodified BPU achieves 98% accuracy on MNIST and 58% on CIFAR-10, surpassing size-matched MLPs. Scaling the BPU via structured connectome expansions further improves CIFAR-10 performance, while modality-specific ablations reveal the uneven contributions of different sensory subsystems. On the ChessBench dataset, a lightweight GNN-BPU model trained on only 10,000 games achieves 60% move accuracy, nearly 10x better than any size transformer. Moreover, CNN-BPU models with ~2M parameters outperform parameter-matched Transformers, and with a depth-6 minimax search at inference, reach 91.7% accuracy, exceeding even a 9M-parameter Transformer baseline. These results demonstrate the potential of biofidelic neural architectures to support complex cognitive tasks and motivate scaling to larger and more intelligent connectomes in future work."

The review traces this evolution from early connectionist models to state-of-the-art large language models, demonstrating how key innovations like transformer attention, foundation-model pre-training, and multi-agent architectures mirror neurobiological processes like cortical mechanisms, working memory, and episodic consolidation. We then discuss emerging physical substrates capable of breaking the von Neumann bottleneck to achieve brain-scale efficiency in silicon: memristive crossbars, in-memory compute arrays, and emerging quantum and photonic devices. There are four critical challenges at this intersection: 1) integrating spiking dynamics with foundation models, 2) maintaining lifelong plasticity without catastrophic forgetting, 3) unifying language with sensorimotor learning in embodied agents, and 4) enforcing ethical safeguards in advanced neuromorphic autonomous systems.

      "abstract": "Reliable in-vitro models are used for optoelectronic device development such as fluorescence detection devices for fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas. A common approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed by a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which fluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and physiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This limits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where consistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is needed. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple replication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models. In this study, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX fluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution into the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site simulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region had a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease towards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was compared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other reported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was tested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence (AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was analysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain sample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to maintain moisture and preserve AF. The model accurately replicated surgical fluorescence conditions and offers a suitable alternative to glioma induction, benefiting the development of fluorescence detection devices across design iterations."

The concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft is particularly low, ranging from nM to fM, which makes it challenging to accurately monitor changes over the course of a clinical trial using existing sensing techniques. By means of an advanced whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensor hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas, we detect and discriminate between different neurotransmitters at the single-molecule level. Our results show that the sensor can detect neurotransmitters with exceptional sensitivity down to 10 aM and discriminate between structurally similar neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, over a large number of detection events. Furthermore, we find that the average WGM resonance shift, induced by a neurotransmitter binding to the sensor, strongly correlates with molecular polarizability values obtained from electronic structure calculations. These findings establish the optoplasmonic WGM sensors as potential biosensor platform in different avenues of neuroscience by detecting and discriminating neurotransmitters as well as investigating their dynamics at ultra low-level concentrations, plausibly contributing to deeper understanding of brain function and neurological disorders."

      "abstract": "Decomposing multivariate time series with certain basic dynamics is crucial for understanding, predicting and controlling nonlinear spatiotemporally dynamic systems such as the brain. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method for decomposing nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics into several basic dynamics (dynamic modes; DMs) with intrinsic frequencies and decay rates. In particular, unlike Fourier transform-based methods, which are used to decompose a single-channel signal into the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves with discrete frequencies at a regular interval, DMD can derive the intrinsic frequencies of a multichannel signal on the basis of the available data; furthermore, it can capture nonstationary components such as alternations between states with different intrinsic frequencies. Here, we propose the use of the distribution of intrinsic frequencies derived from DMDs (DM frequencies) to characterise neural activities. The distributions of DM frequencies in the electroencephalograms of healthy subjects and patients with dementia or Parkinson's disease in a resting state were evaluated. By using the distributions, these patients were distinguished from healthy subjects with significantly greater accuracy than when using amplitude spectra derived by discrete Fourier transform. This finding suggests that the distribution of DM frequencies exhibits distinct behaviour from amplitude spectra, and therefore, the distribution may serve as a new biomarker by characterising the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological signals."

Both methods incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency. Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework."

This study examined the neurophysiological and subjective effects of a 5:5 breathing protocol on stress-related EEG biomarkers using a mobile single-channel EEG system. Thirty-eight healthy adults were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 20), which completed two sessions spaced two weeks apart with daily breathing practice, or a control group (n = 18), which completed one session. In each session, participants underwent an auditory EEG assessment with resting, mental load, and startle conditions. The intervention group also completed a guided breathing session during the first visit and practiced the technique between sessions. EEG biomarkers (ST4, Alpha, Delta, Gamma, VC0) and subjective anxiety levels (STAI) were assessed before and after the intervention. A significant reduction in Gamma power was observed in the intervention group immediately following the first breathing session during mental load (p = .002), indicating acute stress reduction. Across sessions, long-term breathing practice led to increased Alpha and Delta power and reduced ST4 activity, suggesting cumulative improvements in emotional regulation and cognitive efficiency. Correlational analyses revealed that changes in VC0 and Alpha were significantly associated with subjective reports of tension, focus difficulty, and calmness. Guided slow-paced breathing at a 5:5 rhythm produces both immediate and sustained effects on neural markers of stress and cognition, with corresponding improvements in subjective anxiety. These findings support EEG-based monitoring as a scalable method for evaluating breath-based interventions and promoting real-time emotional self-regulation."

Sixty-eight healthy adults completed resting state recordings, cognitively demanding auditory tasks, and exposure to unpredictable literalized startle stimuli. Participants also rated their stress and anxiety using a modified State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). EEG analysis focused on frequency bands (Theta, Gamma, Delta) and machine-learning-derived features (A0, ST4, VC9, T2). A double dissociation emerged: Theta and VC9 increased under cognitive load but not startle, supporting their sensitivity to executive function. In contrast, Gamma and A0 were elevated by the startle stimulus, consistent with stress reactivity. ST4 tracked cognitive effort and worry, while T2 negatively correlated with self-reported calmness, indicating relevance to emotional regulation. These results demonstrate that a short, uniform assessment using portable EEG can yield multiple reliable biomarkers of cognitive and affective states.

Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation.

Motivated by these preliminary observations, our study further explores the discrepancies between EEG-based and self-reported MW assessment methods through an experiment involving visualization tasks. In the experiment, we employ two benchmark tasks: the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) and a Spatial Visualization (SV) task. EEG signals are recorded from participants using a 32-channel system at a sampling rate of 128 Hz during the visualization tasks. For each participant, MW is estimated using an EEG-based model built on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture, and these estimates are compared with conventional MW measures to examine potential discrepancies. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies between task difficulty and EEG-based MW estimates, as well as between EEG-based and self-reported MW measures across varying task difficulty levels.

External validation was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance, achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across different outcomes.

      "abstract": "Objective While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.   Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.   Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.   Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity (except slow frontal activity).   Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity. Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits, which are specific to each of the disorders."

Recently, the adoption of self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption.

AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate models in various scenarios.

Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).   We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous."

First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning."

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance.

In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis."

      "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks."

Analysis of resting state fMRI data from 93 adult males with ASD and 93 matched controls revealed that empirical networks showed lower energy than 1000 topology preserving null models (paired t = -4.12, p less than or equal to 1e-4). Participants with ASD exhibited more negative whole brain energy (t = -3.239, p = 0.0015), driven by increased agreement links and reduced imbalanced same motifs. Subnetwork analysis indicated greater energy in the Default Mode Network after false discovery rate correction (p less than 0.016) and enhanced energy between the Default Mode, Salience and Dorsal Attention networks (p less than 0.032). Energy metrics and inter network connectivity correlated with Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule severity scores (absolute correlation greater than or equal to 0.29, p less than 0.02). A k nearest neighbors classifier using nine principal features including motif proportions, global node link alignment, inter network fALFF weighted and FC strengths, subnetwork magnetization and pairwise energy achieved an accuracy of 79 percent with balanced sensitivity and specificity.

      "abstract": "Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments."

This is the question we aim to address by studying complex cognitive paradigms in terms of Information Theory. To assess creativity and the emergence of patterns from a Shannon perspective, we applied a range of tools, including Entropy Density, Effective Measure Complexity, and the Lempel-Ziv distance. These entropic tools enable the detection of both linear and non-linear dynamics without relying on pre-established parameters, models, or prior assumptions about the data. To identify connections between different brain regions, we analyse task-based fMRI data from subjects during motor, working memory, emotion recognition, and language stimuli to gain insight into these complex cognitive processes. Since this method does not rely on prior knowledge, it is particularly well-suited for exploratory research, facilitating the discovery of previously unidentified connections or patterns in the brain. The capacity to identify non-linear dynamics is especially important for studying brain connectivity, as the brain exhibits significant non-linear interactions across multiple functional levels."

While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \\( \\delta_{\\rm CP} \\sim 359^\\circ \\), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \\( |m_{ee}| \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \\,\\text{eV} \\), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \\( S_4 \\)-based ISS(2,3) framework."

Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing."

In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.",

Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment."

This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications."

Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation."

Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts.

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety."

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

      "abstract": "Tractography algorithms leverage diffusion MRI to reconstruct the fibrous architecture of the brain's white matter. Among machine learning approaches, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for tractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects. TractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by incorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based mechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original TractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate their performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results demonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads to robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or dataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative Reward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages bundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout training. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle feedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms of accuracy and anatomical validity."

We present Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.   We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos), (2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks, and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3 fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost 1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.   In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989 across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024, 0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial inspection under challenging conditions."

      "abstract": "The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times."

Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies.

Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV, a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV) architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N) computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging technologies in resource-constrained environments.

This report presents an analysis of light pollution data from the \\textit{Was het donker} SQM network from 2020 until 2023, with a focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By integrating measurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network and cloud cover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of night sky brightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the western part of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27 locations were ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light pollution is increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend emerged showing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in brightness, while darker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the dominance of artificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter areas, which reduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon, stars, and cloud backscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky Way were also investigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these changes in night sky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light pollution, such as greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times. These findings emphasize the need for systematic monitoring of light pollution and offer valuable insights that can guide public awareness initiatives and inform light pollution mitigation strategies."

Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation counting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the scintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the interaction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons; however, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron emission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, \"detectable electron emission\" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the liquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, >= 1-2 keV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies. Thus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed. Rigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including detector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and self-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from AuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common assumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit electrons upon gamma-irradiation. Instead, our results suggest that the distinct internal environment of nanoparticles influences their interaction with radiation. These findings offer significant insights for practical applications, including a better mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle radiosensitization in cancer therapy, enhanced gamma-detection efficiency of organic scintillators, and the development of lightweight radiation shields."
