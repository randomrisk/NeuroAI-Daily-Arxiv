      "abstract": "In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain."

      "abstract": "Human languages differ widely in their forms, each having distinct sounds, scripts, and syntax. Yet, they can all convey similar meaning. Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world."

However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in diverse geographical regions.

Motivated by this advantage and the widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and reveal classification errors."

To preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\\times$ compared to the baseline dense model."

Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.

The model's intuitive prediction ability increases nonlinearly with respect to the number of training samples, suggesting that superb mechanics intuitions can be in-principle achieved based on a finite number of samples, reflecting how human brains form good mechanics intuitions just by learning a few cases. Our current work presents an alternative perspective for educating artificial intelligence capable of intuitively understand and predict how materials deform and move, a scenario that has been frequently seen in Science-Fiction movies."

However, critical challenges relating to specificity and contrast, as compared to current gold-standard methods continue to hamper adoption. This work introduces Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), a new absorption microscope modality, which simultaneously captures the dominant de-excitation processes following an absorption event. In PARS, radiative (auto-fluorescence) and non-radiative (photothermal and photoacoustic) relaxation processes are collected simultaneously, providing enhanced specificity to a range of biomolecules. As an example, a multiwavelength PARS system featuring UV (266 nm) and visible (532 nm) excitation is applied to imaging human skin, and murine brain tissue samples. It is shown that PARS can directly characterize, differentiate, and unmix, clinically relevant biomolecules inside complex tissues samples using established statistical processing methods. Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are used to characterize clinically relevant biomolecules (e.g., white, and gray matter) based on their PARS signals, while non-negative least squares (NNLS) is applied to map the biomolecule abundance in murine brain tissues, without stained ground truth images or deep-learning methods. PARS unmixing and abundance estimates are directly validated and compared against chemically stained ground truth images, and deep learning based-image transforms. Overall, it is found that the PARS unique and rich contrast may provide comprehensive, and otherwise inaccessible, label-free characterization of molecular pathology, representing a new source of data to develop AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization."

      "abstract": "Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts. Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli. We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning. Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural settings."

This paper presents a novel framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) to enable personalized mental state evaluation while preserving user privacy. By leveraging physiological signals, including EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG, and respiration, a multimodal model predicts an operator's stress level, facilitating real-time robot adaptation. The FL-based approach allows distributed on-device training, ensuring data confidentiality while improving model generalization and individual customization. Results demonstrate that the deployment of an FL approach results in a global model with performance in stress prediction accuracy comparable to a centralized training approach. Moreover, FL allows for enhancing personalization, thereby optimizing human-robot interaction in industrial settings, while preserving data privacy. The proposed framework advances privacy-preserving, adaptive robotics to enhance workforce well-being in smart manufacturing."

We provide several tunable neural network baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly, predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of personalised treatment for psychological conditions.

To address these challenges, we present UniMind, a general-purpose EEG foundation model for unified multi-task brain decoding by uniquely unleashing the power of large language models to comprehend complex neural patterns. UniMind offers several advantages. First, we design a Neuro-Language Connector to bridge the modality gap between neural signals and large language models, distilling and transforming the spatiotemporal neural patterns of EEG data into representations understandable by language models. Second, a Task-aware Query Selection module is proposed to inject task-awareness into the cross-modal alignment by dynamically generating task-adaptive query tokens, enabling learning of task-relevant neural patterns across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that UniMind substantially outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task decoding models, with an average gain of 12 percent, while also offering valuable neuroscientific insights into neural functional correlations across tasks.

Existing attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological embedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from the actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often available only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and the time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of Homogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more faithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous Differentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their de-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with time-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We apply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of increasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and the Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG recordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain drastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as well as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of magnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the flexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that they can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and reconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical models and real data.",

This study confirms such a correlation, focusing in particular on the sports field, where the flow state tends to occur more frequently. To conduct the study, Sporthype developed proprietary software that integrates several predictive models, in particular the Flow State Index (FSI), implemented within the Holytics system. An analytical protocol was established, including mental exercises and data collection sessions using the portable EEG device Muse, accompanied by a questionnaire to gather athletes' subjective perceptions of their mental state. The results revealed a significant alignment between the EEG data and the subjective experiences reported in the questionnaires, confirming the feasibility of detecting the flow state through prefrontal cortex activity. Furthermore, the psychological exercises included in the study protocol showed a tangible positive effect in enhancing flow during athletic performance. Flow improves performance through a more harmonious synchronization between mind and body. Although golf was the main context of the experimentation, the mathematical models developed within Holytics were designed to be applicable to a wide range of sports. In addition to golf, preliminary tests have been conducted in other sports such as tennis, as well as in non-sport contexts, including gaming and mental training practices such as mindfulness, concentration, and visualization."

We train CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy.

      "abstract": "Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2 staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment, as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic."

      "abstract": "The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to generate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional HER2 diagnostics."

Advanced AI algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can autonomously make decisions to achieve planning and motion goals. However, in healthcare, where human intent is crucial, fully independent machine decisions may not be ideal. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of human-centered shared autonomy AI frameworks, focusing on upper limb biosignal-based machine interfaces and associated motor control systems, including computer cursors, robotic arms, and planar platforms. We examine motor planning, learning (rehabilitation), and control, covering conceptual foundations of human-machine teaming in reach-and-grasp tasks and analyzing both theoretical and practical implementations. Each section explores how human and machine inputs can be blended for shared autonomy in healthcare applications. Topics include human factors, biosignal processing for intent detection, shared autonomy in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), rehabilitation, assistive robotics, and Large Language Models (LLMs) as the next frontier. We propose adaptive shared autonomy AI as a high-performance paradigm for collaborative human-AI systems, identify key implementation challenges, and outline future directions, particularly regarding AI reasoning agents. This analysis aims to bridge neuroscientific insights with robotics to create more intuitive, effective, and ethical human-machine teaming frameworks."

Previous work has shown that cross subject, cross-session invariant features exist in EEG. We propose a transfer learning pipeline based on a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) that leverages these invariants to reduce the burden of data acquisition and calibration. A baseline model is trained on EEG data from five able-bodied individuals and then rapidly updated with a small amount of data from a sixth, holdout subject. The remaining holdout data were used to test the performance of both the baseline and updated models. We repeated this procedure via a leave-one-subject out (LOSO) validation framework. Averaged over six LOSO folds, the updated model improved classification accuracy upon the baseline by 10.0, 18.8, and 22.1 percentage points on two binary and one ternary classification tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that decoding accuracy can be substantially improved with minimal subject-specific data. They also indicate that a CNN-based decoder can be personalized rapidly, enabling near plug-and-play BCI functionality for neurorehabilitation and other time-critical EEG applications."

However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning."

However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice."

In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley digraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive integer. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly on the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$. In our previous paper, we developed a theory for $m$-Cayley isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and classified finite $m$CI-groups for each $m\\geq 2$, and finite $m$PCI-groups for each $m\\geq 4$. The next natural step is to classify finite $m$PCI-groups for $m=2$ or $3$. Note that BCI-groups form an important subclass of the $2$PCI-groups, which were introduced in 2008 by Xu et al. Despite much effort having been made on the study of BCI-groups, the problem of classifying finite BCI-groups is still widely open.   In this paper, we prove that every finite $2$PCI-group is solvable, and its Sylow $3$-subgroup is isomorphic to $Z_3, Z_3\\times Z_3$ or $Z_9$, and Sylow $p$-subgroup with $p\\not=3$ is either elementary abelian, or isomorphic to $Z_4$ or $Q_8$. We also introduce the kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and establish some useful theory for studying this kind of isomorphisms. Using the results of kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs together with the results on $2$PCI-groups, we give a proper description of finite BCI-groups, and in particular, we obtain a complete classification of finite non-abelian BCI-groups."

Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world."

These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks.

However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data."

To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data."

We propose that scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales. We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations, providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like AI systems."

Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions.

Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics.

Recent work has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models' perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets.

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy."

NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on 28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S., South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based clinical research."

Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI.

In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.",

Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications."

Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation."

Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts.

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

      "abstract": "Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

      "abstract": "How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

This is a critical challenge in natural language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove $H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally, we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses, comparing their performance against existing baselines."

      "abstract": "Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available. State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance. We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods significantly.

While participants in a federation might share the hardware they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them, their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration. Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best training settings across all participants.

      "abstract": "Surgical training remains a crucial milestone in modern medicine, with procedures such as laminectomy exemplifying the high risks involved. Laminectomy drilling requires precise manual control to mill bony tissue while preserving spinal segment integrity and avoiding breaches in the dura: the protective membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Despite unintended tears occurring in up to 11.3% of cases, no assistive tools are currently utilized to reduce this risk. Variability in patient anatomy further complicates learning for novice surgeons. This study introduces CAPTAiN, a critical anatomy-preserving and terrain-augmenting navigation system that provides layered, color-coded voxel guidance to enhance anatomical awareness during spinal drilling. CAPTAiN was evaluated against a standard non-navigated approach through 110 virtual laminectomies performed by 11 orthopedic residents and medical students. CAPTAiN significantly improved surgical completion rates of target anatomy (87.99% vs. 74.42%) and reduced cognitive load across multiple NASA-TLX domains. It also minimized performance gaps across experience levels, enabling novices to perform on par with advanced trainees. These findings highlight CAPTAiN's potential to optimize surgical execution and support skill development across experience levels. Beyond laminectomy, it demonstrates potential for broader applications across various surgical and drilling procedures, including those in neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and other medical fields."

This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.   DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements.

In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages.

While CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields, and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space (HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling. Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from 260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%."

Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate cryogenic and amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor-normal metal-superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level with different symmetries. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction."
