Unlike conventional electrophysiological approaches or one-photon optogenetics, which inevitably activate many neurons surrounding the target, two-photon optogenetics can drive hundreds of specifically targeted neurons simultaneously, with stimulation patterns that can be flexibly and rapidly reconfigured. In this review, we trace the development of two-photon optogenetic stimulation, focusing on its progression toward implementations in large field of view two-photon microscopes capable of targeted multi neuron control. We highlight three principal strategies: spiral scanning, temporal focusing, and three-dimensional computer-generated holography (3D CGH), along with their combinations, which together provide powerful tools for causal interrogation of neural circuits and behavior. Finally, we discuss the integration of these optical technologies into brain machine interfaces (BMIs), emphasizing both their transformative potential and the technical challenges that must be addressed to realize their broader impact.",

Conventional neuroimaging classification methods for mTBI detection typically extract summary statistics from brain signals across the different epochs, which may result in the loss of important distributional information, such as variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc. Our approach treats complete probability density functions of epoch space results as functional response variables within a Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression framework, thereby preserving the full distributional characteristics of epoch results from $L_{1}$ minimum norm solutions. The global Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection. In practical applications, the test accuracy on unseen data from Innovision IP's dataset achieves up to 98\\%.",

      "abstract": "Brain networks continually adjust the weights of their connections, resulting in heavy-tailed distributions of their connection weights, a few strong connections among many weaker ones. At the same time, these connections undergo structural plasticity, forming a complex network topology. Although mechanisms producing either heavy-tailed distributions or complex topologies have been proposed, it has remained unclear whether a single mechanism can produce both. We consider homeostasis as the driving principle and propose a Hebbian inspired model that adaptively adjusts weights and rewires directed connections based on homeostatic dynamics. Without adaptive rewiring, weight adjustment alone still generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, as long as activity does not spread beyond locally neighboring units. However, when combined with adaptive rewiring, the homeostatic dynamics create a synergy that produces heavy-tailed weight distributions also for more extended activity flow. Furthermore, the model generates complex network structures that encompass convergent-divergent circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the nervous system. By combining adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring based on the same homeostatic dynamics, our model provides a parsimonious and robust mechanism that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes.",

Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions.

Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill\" phenomenon.",

Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.",

To address this gap, this paper presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny) from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted. (iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10 ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the relevant signal properties.

We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine learning EEG analysis.   Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN.

We compare the performance of CTXSEG with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.   Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and requires fewer segments.

When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation strategies.",

Such devices have the potential to be useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of (Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy",

Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently available datasets.

The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40{\\deg}C Hot, 20{\\deg}C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.",

We collected neural and gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential (ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during naturalistic reading.

Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner. Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence estimation methods.

We demonstrate that an individual with tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI participant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle in Michigan.

PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration.

However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.",

Due to the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, standard approaches often average signals within regions of interest (ROIs), which ignores the underlying spatiotemporal dependence among voxels and can lead to biased or inefficient inference. We propose to use a summary statistic -- the empirical voxel-wise correlations between ROIs -- and, crucially, model the complex covariance structure among these correlations through a new positive definite covariance function. Building on this foundation, we develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that enables statistical inference on covariate effects on region-level connectivity. Simulation studies show calibrated uncertainty quantification, and substantial gains in validity of the statistical inference over the standard averaging method. With data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we show that autism spectrum disorder is associated with altered FC between attention-related ROIs after adjusting for age and gender. The proposed framework offers an interpretable and statistically rigorous approach to estimation of covariate effects on FC suitable for large-scale neuroimaging studies.",

The global Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection.

However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

We explore how different forms of nonlinearity, particularly 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, shape spectral features, including harmonic generation, spectral dispersion, and transient dynamics. While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms. We argue that although no single model fully explains all spectral observations, key constraints emerge: namely, that cortical dynamics exhibit features consistent with turbulent wave systems involving both single and dual cascades and a mixture of 3- and 4-wave interactions.

In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant.

However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains.

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

      "abstract": "Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.",

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third, we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains.

Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.",

Our approach is built upon the nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities. Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision (achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1). For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom, heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective, achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523 for Task 2.

Specifically, we consider a model in which a decision-maker faced with stochastic demand and resource donations must trade off between an equitable and efficient allocation of resources over an infinite horizon. The decision-maker has access to storage with fixed capacity $M$, and incurs efficiency losses when storage is empty (stockouts) or full (overflows). We provide a nearly tight (up to constant factors) characterization of achievable envy-inefficiency pairs. Namely, we introduce a class of Bang-Bang control policies whose inefficiency exhibits a sharp phase transition, dropping from $\\Theta(1/M)$ when $\\Delta = 0$ to $e^{-\\Omega(\\Delta M)}$ when $\\Delta > 0$, where $\\Delta$ is used to denote the target envy of the policy. We complement this with matching lower bounds, demonstrating that the trade-off is driven by supply, as opposed to demand uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that envy-inefficiency trade-offs not only persist in settings with dynamic replenishment, but are shaped by the decision-maker's available capacity, and are therefore qualitatively different compared to previously studied settings with fixed supply.",

Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines the process of converting Python-based neural network models into SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA.

Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools.

Our findings highlight that developers view themselves as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around customization are made, defining limits for customization choices, transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user training.

Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision.
