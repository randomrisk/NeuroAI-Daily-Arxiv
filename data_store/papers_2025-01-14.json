      "abstract": "Age prediction using brain imaging, such as MRIs, has achieved promising results, with several studies identifying the model's residual as a potential biomarker for chronic disease states. In this study, we developed a brain age predictive model using a dataset of 1,220 U.S. veterans (18--80 years) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on two-dimensional slices of axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI images. The model, incorporating a degree-3 polynomial ensemble, achieved an $R^{2}$ of 0.816 on the testing set. Images were acquired at the level of the anterior commissure and the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Residual analysis was performed to assess its potential as a biomarker for five ICD-coded conditions: hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), illicit substance abuse/dependence (SAD), and alcohol abuse/dependence (AAD). Residuals grouped by the number of ICD-coded conditions demonstrated different trends that were statistically significant ($p = 0.002$), suggesting a relationship between disease states and predicted brain age. This association was particularly pronounced in patients over 49 years, where negative residuals (indicating advanced brain aging) correlated with the presence of multiple ICD codes. These findings support the potential of residuals as biomarkers for detecting latent health conditions."

      "abstract": "Artificial synapse is a key element of future brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems implemented in hardware. This work presents a graphene synaptic transistor based on all-technology-compatible materials that exhibits highly tunable biorealistic behavior. It is shown that the device geometry and interface properties can be designed to maximize the memory window and minimize power consumption. The device exhibits a virtually continuous range of multiple conductance levels, similar to synaptic weighting, which is achieved by gradual injection/emission of electrons into the floating gate and interface traps under the influence of an external electric field. Similar to the biological synapse, the transistor has short-term intrinsic dynamics that affect the long-term state. The temporal injection/emission dynamics of an electronic synapse closely resemble those of its biological counterpart and is exploited to emulate biorealistic behavior using a number of synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and others. Such a synaptic transistor can serve as a building block in hardware artificial networks for advanced information processing and storage."

Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both.   In this work, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of LLMs and smaller models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.   To address these challenges, we introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: the alignment module and the collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than LLM based methods and task-specific smaller model."

Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question \"what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?\" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair.

LGL-BCI contains an EEG channel selection module via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a symmetric positive definite matrix, providing adaptiveness among the continuously changing EEG signal.

LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency.

Diagnosis initially relies on the proficiency of radiologists, which can cause difficulties and threats when the expertise is sparse.

This study conveys the Bangladesh Brain Cancer MRI Dataset, containing 6,056 MRI images organized into three categories: Brain Tumor, Brain Glioma, and Brain Menin. The dataset was collected from several hospitals in Bangladesh, providing a diverse and realistic sample for research. We implemented advanced deep learning models, and DenseNet169 achieved exceptional results, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score all reaching 0.9983. In addition, Explainable AI (XAI) methods including GradCAM, GradCAM++, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM were employed to provide visual representations of the decision-making processes of the models. In the context of brain cancer, these techniques highlight DenseNet169's potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy while simultaneously offering transparency, facilitating early diagnosis and better patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "Healthy brain networks usually show highly efficient information communication and self-sustained oscillation abilities. However, how the brain network structure affects these dynamics after an injury (stroke) is not very clear. The recovery of structure and dynamics of stroke brain networks over time is still not known precisely. Based on the analysis of a large number of strokes' brain network data, we show that stroke changes the network properties in connection weights, average degree, clustering, community, etc. Yet, they will recover gradually over time to some extent. We then adopt a simplified reaction-diffusion model to investigate stroke patients' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities. Our results reveal that the stroke slows the adoption time across different brain scales, indicating a weakened brain's activation propagation ability. In addition, we show that the lifetime of self-sustained oscillatory patterns at three months post-stroke patients' brains significantly departs from the healthy one. Finally, we examine the properties of core networks of self-sustained oscillatory patterns, in which the directed edges denote the main pathways of activation propagation. Our results demonstrate that the lifetime and recovery of self-sustaining patterns are related to the properties of core networks, and the properties in the post-stroke greatly vary from those in the healthy group. Most importantly, the strokes' activation propagation and self-sustained oscillation abilities significantly improve at one year post-stroke, driven by structural connection repair. This work may help us to understand the relationship between structure and function in brain disorders."

EEG and fNIRS have been utilized to provide valuable insights, but their individual limitations have hindered performance. This study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying rest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI dataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a multimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional Additive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging convolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in multimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a computationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a hybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from separate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate that MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities (EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than EEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with embedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and OD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data. This work highlights the potential of deep learning, specifically MECASA, to enhance EEG-fNIRS fusion for BCI applications."

To address these shortcomings, we present an ML filtration algorithm driven by a logistic covariance-targeted adversarial denoising autoencoder (TADA). We hypothesize that the expressivity of a targeted, correlation-driven convolutional autoencoder will enable effective time series filtration while minimizing compute requirements (e.g., runtime, model size). Furthermore, we expect that adversarial training with covariance rescaling will minimize signal degradation. To test this hypothesis, a TADA system prototype was trained and evaluated on the task of removing electromyographic (EMG) noise from EEG data in the EEGdenoiseNet dataset, which includes EMG and EEG data from 67 subjects. The TADA filter surpasses conventional signal filtration algorithms across quantitative metrics (Correlation Coefficient, Temporal RRMSE, Spectral RRMSE), and performs competitively against other deep learning architectures at a reduced model size of less than 400,000 trainable parameters.

Identification of a treatment response at any earlier stage is of great importance, since it can reduce the emotional and economic burden connected with the treatment. We approach the prediction of a patient response to a treatment as a classification problem, by utilizing the dynamic properties of EEG recordings on the 7th day of the treatment. We present a novel framework that applies motif discovery to extract meaningful features from EEG data distinguishing between depression treatment responders and non-responders. We applied our framework also to classification tasks in other psychiatric EEG datasets, namely to patients with symptoms of schizophrenia, pediatric patients with intractable seizures, and Alzheimer disease and dementia. We achieved high classification precision in all data sets. The results demonstrate that the dynamic properties of the EEGs may support clinicians in decision making both in diagnosis and in the prediction depression treatment response as early as on the 7th day of the treatment.

However, EEG-based speech decoding faces major challenges, such as noisy data, limited datasets, and poor performance on complex tasks like speech perception. This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech."

      "abstract": "In practical sleep stage classification, a key challenge is the variability of EEG data across different subjects and environments. Differences in physiology, age, health status, and recording conditions can lead to domain shifts between data. These domain shifts often result in decreased model accuracy and reliability, particularly when the model is applied to new data with characteristics different from those it was originally trained on, which is a typical manifestation of negative transfer. To address this, we propose SelectiveFinetuning in this paper. Our method utilizes a pretrained Multi Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) to extract EEG features, capturing the distinctive characteristics of different sleep stages. To mitigate the effect of domain shifts, we introduce a domain aligning mechanism that employs Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to evaluate and select source domain data closely matching the target domain. By finetuning the model with selective source data, our SelectiveFinetuning enhances the model's performance on target domain that exhibits domain shifts compared to the data used for training. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines, offering greater robustness and adaptability in practical scenarios where data distributions are often unpredictable."

      "abstract": "Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question \"what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?\" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer."

Despite some advances in recent years, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor-imagery tasks face challenges, such as amplitude and phase variability and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller models and faster inference. In this study, we develop a prototype, called the Lightweight Geometric Learning Brain--Computer Interface (LGL-BCI), which uses our customized geometric deep learning architecture for swift model inference without sacrificing accuracy. LGL-BCI contains an EEG channel selection module via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a symmetric positive definite matrix, providing adaptiveness among the continuously changing EEG signal. Meanwhile, a built-in lossless transformation helps boost the inference speed. The performance of our solution was evaluated using two real-world EEG devices and two public EEG datasets. LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency. These findings underscore both the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of LGL-BCI, demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of geometric deep learning in motor-imagery brain--computer interface applications."

This study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying rest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI dataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a multimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional Additive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging convolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in multimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a computationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a hybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from separate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate that MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities (EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than EEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with embedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and OD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data.

The proposed model architecture consists of three main parts: EEG module, speech module, and phoneme predictor. The EEG module learns to properly represent EEG signals into EEG embeddings. The speech module generates speech waveforms from the EEG embeddings. The phoneme predictor outputs the decoded phoneme sequences in text modality. Our proposed approach allows users to obtain decoded listened speech from EEG signals in both modalities (speech waveforms and textual phoneme sequences) simultaneously, eliminating the need for a concatenated sequential pipeline for each modality. The proposed approach also outperforms previous methods in both modalities. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.",

However, EEG-based speech decoding faces major challenges, such as noisy data, limited datasets, and poor performance on complex tasks like speech perception. This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech."

The RSVP-BCI systems effectively detect single-class targets within a stream of images but have limited applicability in scenarios that require detecting multiple target categories. Multi-class RSVP-BCI systems address this limitation by simultaneously identifying the presence of a target and distinguishing its category. However, existing multi-class RSVP decoding algorithms predominantly rely on single-modality EEG decoding, which restricts their performance improvement due to the high similarity between ERPs evoked by different target categories. In this work, we introduce eye movement (EM) modality into multi-class RSVP decoding and explore EEG and EM fusion to enhance decoding performance. First, we design three independent multi-class target RSVP tasks and build an open-source dataset comprising EEG and EM signals from 43 subjects. Then, we propose the Multi-class Target RSVP EEG and EM fusion Network (MTREE-Net) to enhance multi-class RSVP decoding. Specifically, a dual-complementary module is proposed to strengthen the differentiation of uni-modal features across categories. To improve multi-modal fusion performance, we adopt a dynamic reweighting fusion strategy guided by theoretically derived modality contribution ratios. Furthermore, we reduce the misclassification of non-target samples through knowledge transfer between two hierarchical classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of integrating EM signals into multi-class RSVP decoding and highlight the superior performance of MTREE-Net compared to existing RSVP decoding methods. The proposed MTREE-Net and open-source dataset provide a promising framework for developing practical multi-class RSVP-BCI systems."

The current RSVP decoding methods can perform well in decoding EEG signals within a single RSVP task, but their decoding performance significantly decreases when directly applied to different RSVP tasks without calibration data from the new tasks. This limits the rapid and efficient deployment of RSVP-BCI systems for detecting different categories of targets in various scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this study aims to enhance the cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding performance. First, we design three distinct RSVP tasks for target image retrieval and build an open-source dataset containing EEG signals and corresponding stimulus images. Then we propose an EEG with Language-Image Prior fusion Transformer (ELIPformer) for cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding. Specifically, we propose a prompt encoder based on the language-image pre-trained model to extract language-image features from task-specific prompts and stimulus images as prior knowledge for enhancing EEG decoding. A cross bidirectional attention mechanism is also adopted to facilitate the effective feature fusion and alignment between the EEG and language-image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding, which promotes the RSVP-BCI system from research to practical application."

This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data.

Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems."

We argue that at this time, a strong emphasis on human-AI teaming, in contrast to fully autonomous AI BCI researcher will be the most promising way forward. We introduce the collaborative workspaces concept for human-AI teaming based on a set of Janusian design principles, looking both ways, to the human as well as to the AI side. Based on these principles, we present ChatBCI, a Python-based toolbox for enabling human-AI collaboration based on interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for BCI research and development projects. We show how ChatBCI was successfully used in a concrete BCI project on advancing motor imagery decoding from EEG signals.

Traditional analyses that focus solely on pairwise interactions often oversimplify these systems, neglecting the higher-order interactions critical for understanding their full collective dynamics. Recent advances in multivariate information theory provide a principled framework for quantifying these higher-order interactions, capturing key properties such as redundancy, synergy, shared randomness, and collective constraints. However, two major challenges persist: accurately estimating joint entropies and addressing the combinatorial explosion of interacting terms. To overcome these challenges, we introduce THOI (Torch-based High-Order Interactions), a novel, accessible, and efficient Python library for computing high-order interactions in continuous-valued systems. THOI leverages the well-established Gaussian copula method for joint entropy estimation, combined with state-of-the-art batch and parallel processing techniques to optimize performance across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments. Our results demonstrate that THOI significantly outperforms existing tools in terms of speed and scalability. For larger systems, where exhaustive analysis is computationally impractical, THOI integrates optimization strategies that make higher-order interaction analysis feasible. We validate THOI accuracy using synthetic datasets with parametrically controlled interactions and further illustrate its utility by analyzing fMRI data from human subjects in wakeful resting states and under deep anesthesia. Finally, we analyzed over 900 real-world and synthetic datasets, establishing a comprehensive framework for applying higher-order interaction (HOI) analysis in complex systems."

In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships."

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening."

Results show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate brain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion inputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner. Collectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding.   Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using simultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates that the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with around half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities. Comparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from fMRI and Ca2+ signals.   The introduction (Chapter 1) is divided similarly to this abstract: sections 1.1 to 1.8 provide background information about Project #1, and sections 1.9 to 1.13 are related to Project #2. Chapter 2 includes historical background, Chapter 3 provides the necessary mathematical background, and finally, Chapter 6 contains concluding remarks and future directions."

      "abstract": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) is commonly employed to study human brain activity, since it offers insight into the relationship between functional fluctuations and human behavior. To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders, with significant impacts on many daily activities and quality of life. It stands as one of the most common mental disorders globally and ranks as the second leading cause of disability. The current diagnostic approach for MDD primarily relies on clinical observations and patient-reported symptoms, overlooking the diverse underlying causes and pathophysiological factors contributing to depression. Therefore, scientific researchers and clinicians must gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MDD. There is growing evidence in neuroscience that depression is a brain network disorder, and the use of neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a significant role in identifying and treating MDD. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques used to study MDD. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to neuroimaging data to help with early mental health disorder detection. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in graph neural networks (GNNs), which are deep neural architectures specifically designed to handle graph-structured data like rs-fMRI. This research aimed to develop an ensemble-based GNN model capable of detecting discriminative features from rs-fMRI images for the purpose of diagnosing MDD. Specifically, we constructed an ensemble model by combining features from multiple brain region segmentation atlases to capture brain complexity and detect distinct features more accurately than single atlas-based models. Further, the effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by assessing its performance on a large multi-site MDD dataset. The best performing model among all folds achieved an accuracy of 75.80%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 61.84%, a precision of 71.29%, and an F1-score of 79.12%."

The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future."

Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening."

In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli."

However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\\% to 54.88\\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language."

MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning.

Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential."

The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions."

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods.

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

      "abstract": "Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in AI models are structured to retain user interactions, which could inadvertently include sensitive healthcare data. In the healthcare field, particularly when radiologists use AI-driven diagnostic tools hosted on online platforms, there is a risk that medical imaging data may be repurposed for future AI training without explicit consent, spotlighting critical privacy and intellectual property concerns around healthcare data usage. Addressing these privacy challenges, a novel approach known as Unlearnable Examples (UEs) has been introduced, aiming to make data unlearnable to deep learning models. A prominent method within this area, called Unlearnable Clustering (UC), has shown improved UE performance with larger batch sizes but was previously limited by computational resources. To push the boundaries of UE performance with theoretically unlimited resources, we scaled up UC learning across various datasets using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training on the Summit supercomputer. Our goal was to examine UE efficacy at high-performance computing (HPC) levels to prevent unauthorized learning and enhance data security, particularly exploring the impact of batch size on UE's unlearnability. Utilizing the robust computational capabilities of the Summit, extensive experiments were conducted on diverse datasets such as Pets, MedMNist, Flowers, and Flowers102. Our findings reveal that both overly large and overly small batch sizes can lead to performance instability and affect accuracy. However, the relationship between batch size and unlearnability varied across datasets, highlighting the necessity for tailored batch size strategies to achieve optimal data protection. Our results underscore the critical role of selecting appropriate batch sizes based on the specific characteristics of each dataset to prevent learning and ensure data security in deep learning applications."

However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing."

Theory and Methods: To encode the underlying B1+, multiple (two to four) TSE image sets with various excitation and refocusing flip angles were acquired. To this end, the acquired signal intensities were matched to a database of simulated signals which was generated by solving the Bloch equations taking into account the exact sequence parameters. The retrieved B1+ values were validated against gradient-recalled and spin echo dual angle methods, as well as a vendor-provided turboFLASH-based mapping sequence, in gel phantoms and human subjects without and with metal implants. Results: In the absence of metal, phantom experiments demonstrated excellent agreement between the proposed technique using three or four flip angle sets and reference dual angle methods. In human subjects without metal implants, the proposed technique with three or four flip angle sets showed excellent correlation with the spin echo dual angle method. In the presence of metal, both phantoms and human subjects revealed a narrow range of B1+ estimation with the reference techniques, whereas the proposed technique successfully resolved B1+ near the metal. In select cases, the technique was implemented in conjunction with multispectral metal artifact reduction sequences and successfully applied for B1+ shimming. Conclusion: The proposed technique enables resolution of B1+ values in regions near metal hardware, overcoming susceptibility-related and narrow-range limitations of standard mapping techniques."

For such an assessment, it is necessary to distinguish a nail, which locally appears to be similar to the skin. Many algorithms have been used, each of which leverages different aspects of toenail appearance. We used the Hough transform to locate the tip of the toe and estimate the nail location and size. Subsequently, we classified the super-pixels of the image based on their geometric and photometric information. Thereafter, the watershed transform delineated the border of the nail. The method was validated using a 348-image medical dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.993 and an F-measure of 0.925. The proposed method is considerably robust across samples, with respect to factors such as nail shape, skin pigmentation, illumination conditions, and appearance of large regions affected by a medical condition"

      "abstract": "3D digital anthropometry is the study of estimating human body measurements from 3D scans. Precise body measurements are important health indicators in the medical industry, and guiding factors in the fashion, ergonomic and entertainment industries. The measuring protocol consists of scanning the whole subject in the static A-pose, which is maintained without breathing or movement during the scanning process. However, the A-pose is not easy to maintain during the whole scanning process, which can last even up to a couple of minutes. This constraint affects the final quality of the scan, which in turn affects the accuracy of the estimated body measurements obtained from methods that rely on dense geometric data. Additionally, this constraint makes it impossible to develop a digital anthropometry method for subjects unable to assume the A-pose, such as those with injuries or disabilities. We propose a method that can obtain body measurements from sparse landmarks acquired in any pose. We make use of the sparse landmarks of the posed subject to create pose-independent features, and train a network to predict the body measurements as taken from the standard A-pose. We show that our method achieves comparable results to competing methods that use dense geometry in the standard A-pose, but has the capability of estimating the body measurements from any pose using sparse landmarks only.

      "abstract": "The skin, as the largest organ of the human body, is vulnerable to a diverse array of conditions collectively known as skin lesions, which encompass various dermatoses. Diagnosing these lesions presents significant challenges for medical practitioners due to the subtle visual differences that are often imperceptible to the naked eye. While not all skin lesions are life-threatening, certain types can act as early indicators of severe diseases, including skin cancers, underscoring the critical need for timely and accurate diagnostic methods. Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable potential in facilitating the early detection and prognosis of skin lesions. This study advances the field by curating a comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 39 categories of skin lesions, synthesized from five publicly available datasets. Using this dataset, the performance of five state-of-the-art deep learning models -- MobileNetV2, Xception, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB1, and Vision Transformer - is rigorously evaluated. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of these models, attention mechanisms such as the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) are incorporated into their architectures. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple performance metrics reveals that the Vision Transformer model integrated with CBAM outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 94%, recall of 93%, F1-score of 93%, and specificity of 93.67%. These results underscore the significant potential of the proposed system in supporting medical professionals with accurate and efficient prognostic tools for diagnosing a broad spectrum of skin lesions.

However, most weakly supervised methods either involve a strong downsampling of input images, or only achieve localization at a coarse resolution, both of which are unsatisfactory for small structures. We propose a novel framework that increases the spatial resolution of a traditional attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to prompt the Segment Anything Model (SAM~2), and increases recall with iterative inference. Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing MIL with a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT), which adds a positional encoding, and permits an exchange of information between different regions of the OCT image, leads to a further and substantial increase in segmentation accuracy."

As a non-invasive diagnostic tool, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most widely used methods for cardiac screening. However, the scarcity of high-quality ECG data, driven by privacy concerns and limited medical resources, creates a pressing need for effective ECG signal generation. Existing approaches for generating ECG signals typically rely on small training datasets, lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks, and overlook potential applications beyond data augmentation. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuSETS, a novel framework capable of generating ECG signals with high semantic alignment and fidelity. DiffuSETS accepts various modalities of clinical text reports and patient-specific information as inputs, enabling the creation of clinically meaningful ECG signals. Additionally, to address the lack of standardized evaluation in ECG generation, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking methodology to assess the effectiveness of generative models in this domain. Our model achieve excellent results in tests, proving its superiority in the task of ECG generation. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to mitigate data scarcity while exploring novel applications in cardiology education and medical knowledge discovery, highlighting the broader impact of our work."

Due to the curse of dimensionality, application of such algorithms can easily become computationally prohibitive. This work proposes a scenario-free probabilistic robust optimization algorithm that overcomes both the runtime and memory limitations typical of traditional robustness algorithms. The scenario-free approach minimizes cost-functions evaluated on expected-dose distributions and total variance. Calculation of these quantities relies on precomputed expected-dose-influence and total-variance-influence matrices, such that no scenarios need to be stored for optimization. The algorithm was developed within matRad and tested in several optimization configurations for photon and proton irradiation plans. A traditional robust optimization algorithm and a margin-based approach are used as a reference to benchmark the performances of the scenario-free algorithm in terms of plan quality, robustness and computational workload. The scenario-free approach achieves plan quality compatible with traditional robust optimization algorithms and it reduces the standard deviation within selected structures when variance reduction objectives are defined. Avoiding the storage of individual scenario information allows for the inclusion of an arbitrary number of error scenarios. The observed optimization time is independent on the number of included scenarios, compatible with a nominal, non-robust algorithm and significantly lower than the traditional robust approach. These properties make the scenario-free approach suitable for the optimization of robust plans involving a high number of error scenarios and CT phases as 4D robust optimization."

However, due to the inherent non-linearity and ill-conditioned nature of the EIT inverse problem, the reconstructed image is highly sensitive to the measured data, and random noise artifacts often appear in the reconstructed image, which greatly limits the application of EIT. To address this issue, a conditional diffusion model with voltage consistency (CDMVC) is proposed in this study. The method consists of a pre-imaging module, a conditional diffusion model for reconstruction, a forward voltage constraint network and a scheme of voltage consistency constraint during sampling process. The pre-imaging module is employed to generate the initial reconstruction. This serves as a condition for training the conditional diffusion model. Finally, based on the forward voltage constraint network, a voltage consistency constraint is implemented in the sampling phase to incorporate forward information of EIT, thereby enhancing imaging quality. A more complete dataset, including both common and complex concave shapes, is generated. The proposed method is validated using both simulation and physical experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images. In addition, experimental results also demonstrate that our method has good robustness and generalization performance."
