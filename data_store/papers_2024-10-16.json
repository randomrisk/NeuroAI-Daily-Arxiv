      "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of brain abnormalities is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of complementary multi-parametric MRI imaging data. There is significant potential to develop a universal pre-training model that can be quickly adapted for image modalities and various clinical scenarios. However, current models often rely on uni-modal image data, neglecting the cross-modal correlations among different image modalities or struggling to scale up pre-training in the presence of missing modality data. In this paper, we propose BrainMVP, a multi-modal vision pre-training framework for brain image analysis using multi-parametric MRI scans. First, we collect 16,022 brain MRI scans (over 2.4 million images), encompassing eight MRI modalities sourced from a diverse range of centers and devices. Then, a novel pre-training paradigm is proposed for the multi-modal MRI data, addressing the issue of missing modalities and achieving multi-modal information fusion. Cross-modal reconstruction is explored to learn distinctive brain image embeddings and efficient modality fusion capabilities. A modality-wise data distillation module is proposed to extract the essence representation of each MR image modality for both the pre-training and downstream application purposes. Furthermore, we introduce a modality-aware contrastive learning module to enhance the cross-modality association within a study. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art pre-training methods in the medical domain, with Dice Score improvement of 0.28%-14.47% across six segmentation benchmarks and a consistent accuracy improvement of 0.65%-18.07% in four individual classification tasks."

      "abstract": "Sparse and asynchronous sensing and processing in natural organisms lead to ultra low-latency and energy-efficient perception. Event cameras, known as neuromorphic vision sensors, are designed to mimic these characteristics. However, fully utilizing the sparse and asynchronous event stream remains challenging. Influenced by the mature algorithms of standard cameras, most existing event-based algorithms still rely on the \"group of events\" processing paradigm (e.g., event frames, 3D voxels) when handling event streams. This paradigm encounters issues such as feature loss, event stacking, and high computational burden, which deviates from the intended purpose of event cameras. To address these issues, we propose a fully asynchronous neuromorphic paradigm that integrates event cameras, spiking networks, and neuromorphic processors (Intel Loihi). This paradigm can faithfully process each event asynchronously as it arrives, mimicking the spike-driven signal processing in biological brains. We compare the proposed paradigm with the existing \"group of events\" processing paradigm in detail on the real mobile robot dodging task. Experimental results show that our scheme exhibits better robustness than frame-based methods with different time windows and light conditions. Additionally, the energy consumption per inference of our scheme on the embedded Loihi processor is only 4.30% of that of the event spike tensor method on NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX with energy-saving mode, and 1.64% of that of the event frame method on the same neuromorphic processor. As far as we know, this is the first time that a fully asynchronous neuromorphic paradigm has been implemented for solving sequential tasks on real mobile robot."

We characterize their successes as addressing an important developmental problem: they provide machines with an incentive to improve X (where X represents the desired capability) and opportunities to practice it, through explicit optimization for X; unlike conventional approaches that hope for achieving X through generalization from related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to four classic challenges: systematicity, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning; we also discuss related aspects of human development in natural environments."

A convenient framework makes use of metrics to measure similarity between networks. In this context, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model that identifies clusters of networks characterized by similar connectivity patterns. Our approach relies on a location-scale Dirichlet process mixture of centered Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi kernels, with components parametrized by a unique network representative, or mode, and a univariate measure of dispersion around the mode. We demonstrate that this model has full support in the Kullback--Leibler sense and is strongly consistent. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme is proposed for posterior inference and clustering of multiple network data. The performance of the model is validated through extensive simulation studies, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present an effective strategy to extend the application of the proposed model to datasets with a large number of nodes. We illustrate our approach with the analysis of human brain network data."

Moreover, incorporating various hosts and intercalants enables a series of crystal structures with a rich spectrum of characteristics, greatly expanding the scope and fundamental understanding of existing materials. Herein, we summarize the methods typically used for the intercalation of functional materials. We highlight recent progress in intercalation-based phase transitions and their emerging physics, i.e., ferroelectric, magnetic, insulator-metal, superconducting, and charge-density-wave phase transitions.

      "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in automatic brain tumor segmentation methods, their performance is not guaranteed when certain MR sequences are missing. Addressing this issue, it is crucial to synthesize the missing MR images that reflect the unique characteristics of the absent modality with precise tumor representation. Typically, MRI synthesis methods generate partial images rather than full-sized volumes due to computational constraints. This limitation can lead to a lack of comprehensive 3D volumetric information and result in image artifacts during the merging process. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach that first synthesizes MR images from 2D slices using a novel intensity encoding method and then refines the synthesized MRI. The proposed intensity encoding reduces artifacts when synthesizing MRI on a 2D slice basis. Then, the \\textit{Refiner}, which leverages complete 3D volume information, further improves the quality of the synthesized images and enhances their applicability to segmentation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the intensity encoding effectively minimizes artifacts in the synthesized MRI and improves perceptual quality. Furthermore, using the \\textit{Refiner} on synthesized MRI significantly improves brain tumor segmentation results, highlighting the potential of our approach in practical applications."

We focus on the G351.77 protocluster ($\\sim$ 2500 M$_{\\odot}$, estimated from single-dish continuum observations) located at 2 kpc. We trace the dense gas emission and kinematics with N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) at $\\sim$ 4 kau resolution. We estimate an N$_2$H$^+$ relative abundance $\\sim (1.7 \\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-10}$. We decompose the N$_2$H$^+$ emission into up to two velocity components, highlighting the kinematic complexity in the dense gas. By examining the position-velocity (PV) diagrams on small scales, we observe clear inflow signatures (V-shapes) associated with dense cores. The most prominent V-shape has a mass inflow rate of $\\sim 9.8 \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a short timescale of $\\sim$ 15.6 kyr. We also observe V-shapes without associated cores. This suggests both that cores or centers of accretion exist below the 1.3 mm detection limit, and that the V-shapes may be viable tracers of very early accretion and star formation on $\\sim$ 4 kau scales. The large-scale PV diagram shows that the protocluster is separated into 2 principal velocity structures. Combined with smaller scale DCN and H$_2$CO emission, we propose a scenario of larger scale slow contraction with rotation in the center based on simple toy models. This scenario leads the suggestion of outside-in evolution of the protocluster as it collapses. The gas depletion times implied by the V-shapes are short ($\\sim$ 0.3 Myr), requiring either very fast cluster formation, and/or continuous mass feeding of the protocluster. The latter is possible via the Mother Filament G351.77 is forming out of. The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently published work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions inferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to protoclusters."

Our approach builds on prior work by incorporating Hessian matrix computation from lesion probability maps before using the random walker algorithm to estimate the volume of each unique lesion. Synthetic images demonstrate our ability to accurately count the number of lesions present. The takeaways, are: 1) that our method correctly identifies all lesions including many that are missed by previous methods; 2) we can better separate confluent lesions; and 3) we can accurately capture the total volume of WMLs in a given probability map.

Recently, significant advancements have been achieved using various deep learning-based techniques to address the EER problem. However, the absence of a convincing benchmark and open-source codebase complicates fair comparisons between different models and poses reproducibility challenges for practitioners. These issues considerably impede progress in this field. In light of this, we propose a comprehensive benchmark and algorithm library (LibEER) for fair comparisons in EER by making most of the implementation details of different methods consistent and using the same single codebase in PyTorch. In response to these challenges, we propose LibEER, a comprehensive benchmark and algorithm library for fair comparisons in EER, by ensuring consistency in the implementation details of various methods and utilizing a single codebase in PyTorch. LibEER establishes a unified evaluation framework with standardized experimental settings, enabling unbiased evaluations of over ten representative deep learning-based EER models across the four most commonly used datasets. Additionally, we conduct an exhaustive and reproducible comparison of the performance and efficiency of popular models, providing valuable insights for researchers in selecting and designing EER models.

Therefore, in this study, we propose multivariate transfer entropy-based connectivity networks for cognitive events and introduce a new similarity measure, 'SimBrainNet', to assess these networks. A high similarity score suggests similar brain dynamics during cognitive events, indicating less attention variability. Our experiment involves 12 individuals with attention disorders (7 children and 5 adolescents).

This work investigates EEG-estimated functional connectivity (FC) as a Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker. Specifically, we investigate FC mediated via neural oscillations and consider such activity during the Simons conflict task. This task yields sensory-motor conflict, and one might expect differences in behavior between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to considering spatially focused approaches, such as FC, as a biomarker, we also consider temporal biomarkers, which are more sensitive to ongoing changes in neural activity. We find that FC, estimated from delta (1-4Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) oscillations, yields spatial FC patterns significantly better at distinguishing PD from HC than temporal features or behavior. This study reinforces that FC in spectral bands is informative of differences in brain-wide processes and can serve as a biomarker distinguishing normal brain function from that seen in disease."

      "abstract": "Research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with encephalography feedback (EEG-TMS) has shown that the phase of the sensorimotor mu rhythm is predictive of corticospinal excitability. Thus, if the subject-specific optimal phase is known, stimulation can be timed to be more efficient. In this paper, we present a closed-loop algorithm to determine the optimal phase linked to the highest excitability with few trials. We used Bayesian optimization as an automated, online search tool in an EEG-TMS simulation experiment. From a sample of 38 participants, we selected all participants with a significant single-subject phase effect (N = 5) for simulation. We then simulated 1000 experimental sessions per participant where we used Bayesian optimization to find the optimal phase. We tested two objective functions: Fitting a sinusoid in Bayesian linear regression or Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We additionally tested adaptive sampling using a knowledge gradient as the acquisition function compared with random sampling. We evaluated the algorithm's performance in a fast optimization (100 trials) and a long-term optimization (1000 trials). For fast optimization, the Bayesian linear regression in combination with adaptive sampling gives the best results with a mean phase location accuracy of 79 % after 100 trials. With either sampling approach, Bayesian linear regression performs better than GP regression in the fast optimization. In the long-term optimization, Bayesian regression with random sampling shows the best trajectory, with a rather steep improvement and good final performance of 87 % mean phase location accuracy. We show the suitability of closed-loop Bayesian optimization for phase selection. We could increase the speed and accuracy by using prior knowledge about the expected function shape compared with traditional Bayesian optimization with GP regression.",

A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements.

We evaluate the performance of the single-trial detection of event-related potentials representing one major BCI paradigm.

Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training.

However, existing EEG attacks mainly focus on single-target class attacks, and they either require engaging the training stage of the target BCI, or fail to maintain high stealthiness. Addressing these limitations, Professor X exploits a three-stage clean label poisoning attack: 1) selecting one trigger for each class; 2) learning optimal injecting EEG electrodes and frequencies strategy with reinforcement learning for each trigger; 3) generating poisoned samples by injecting the corresponding trigger's frequencies into poisoned data for each class by linearly interpolating the spectral amplitude of both data according to previously learned strategies. Experiments on datasets of three common EEG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Professor X, which also easily bypasses existing backdoor defenses."

The model treats the EEG classification of each individual as an independent task and facilitates feature sharing across individuals. Our model consists of an impulsive neural population coupled with a convolutional encoder-decoder to extract shared features and a bidirectional associative memory matrix to map features to class. Experimental results in two BCI competition datasets show that our model improves average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and reduces performance variance across individuals, and the waveforms reconstructed by the bidirectional associative memory provide interpretability for the model's classification results. The neuronal firing patterns in our model are highly coordinated, similarly to the neural coding of hippocampal neurons, indicating that our model has biological similarities."

Each device promises better clinical outcomes and quality-of-life improvements, yet due to severe and inflexible safety constraints, progress requires tight co-design from materials to circuits and all the way up the stack to applications and algorithms. This trend has become more aggressive over time, forcing clinicians and patients to rely on vendor-specific hardware and software for deployment, maintenance, upgrades, and replacement. This over-reliance is ethically problematic, especially if companies go out-of-business or business objectives diverge from clinical promises. Device heterogeneity additionally burdens clinicians and healthcare facilities, adding complexity and costs for in-clinic visits, monitoring, and continuous access.   Reliability, interoperability, portability, and future-proofed design is needed, but this unfortunately comes at a cost. These system features sap resources that would have otherwise been allocated to reduce power/energy and improve performance. Navigating this trade-off in a systematic way is critical to providing patients with forever access to their implants and reducing burdens placed on healthcare providers and caretakers. We study the integration of on-device storage to highlight the sensitivity of this trade-off and establish other points of interest within BCI design that require careful investigation. In the process, we revisit relevant problems in computer architecture and medical devices from the current era of hardware specialization and modern neurotechnology."

We designed a closed-loop system for motor augmentation using an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to cue users' volitional finger tapping. Relying on the readiness potentials, the system autonomously cued the finger movement at the time of the intent to interact via electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The prototype discriminated pre-movement from idle EEG segments with an average F1 score of 0.7. However, we found only weak evidence for a maintained SoA.

After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding."

In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models."

      "abstract": "The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.",

However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities."

Deep Learning (DL) Super-Resolution (SR) methods have emerged as a promising solution to enhance fMRI resolution, generating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images typically acquired with lower scanning times. However, most existing SR approaches depend on supervised DL techniques, which require training ground truth (GT) HR data, which is often difficult to acquire and simultaneously sets a bound for how far SR can go.

      "abstract": "Echocardiography (ECHO) is essential for cardiac assessments, but its video quality and interpretation heavily relies on manual expertise, leading to inconsistent results from clinical and portable devices. ECHO video generation offers a solution by improving automated monitoring through synthetic data and generating high-quality videos from routine health data. However, existing models often face high computational costs, slow inference, and rely on complex conditional prompts that require experts' annotations. To address these challenges, we propose ECHOPULSE, an ECG-conditioned ECHO video generation model. ECHOPULSE introduces two key advancements: (1) it accelerates ECHO video generation by leveraging VQ-VAE tokenization and masked visual token modeling for fast decoding, and (2) it conditions on readily accessible ECG signals, which are highly coherent with ECHO videos, bypassing complex conditional prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use time-series prompts like ECG signals for ECHO video generation. ECHOPULSE not only enables controllable synthetic ECHO data generation but also provides updated cardiac function information for disease monitoring and prediction beyond ECG alone. Evaluations on three public and private datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in ECHO video generation across both qualitative and quantitative measures. Additionally, ECHOPULSE can be easily generalized to other modality generation tasks, such as cardiac MRI, fMRI, and 3D CT generation.

To study the association between individual brain connectivity networks and the clinical characteristics, we develop BSNMani: a Bayesian scalar-on-network regression model with manifold learning. BSNMani comprises two components: the network manifold learning model for brain connectivity networks, which extracts shared connectivity structures and subject-specific network features, and the joint predictive model for clinical outcomes, which studies the association between clinical phenotypes and subject-specific network features while adjusting for potential confounding covariates. For posterior computation, we develop a novel two-stage hybrid algorithm combining Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and Gibbs sampling. Our method is not only able to extract meaningful subnetwork features that reveal shared connectivity patterns, but can also reveal their association with clinical phenotypes, further enabling clinical outcome prediction. We demonstrate our method through simulations and through its application to real resting-state fMRI data from a study focusing on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Our approach sheds light on the intricate interplay between brain connectivity and clinical features, offering insights that can contribute to our understanding of psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as mental health."

      "abstract": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact and lightweight sensors that can measure magnetic fields generated by current flow in neuronal assemblies in the brain. Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.

We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \\( t \\) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \\( t \\) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject."

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions."

Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG.

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "Humans judge perceptual similarity according to diverse visual attributes, including scene layout, subject location, and camera pose. Existing vision models understand a wide range of semantic abstractions but improperly weigh these attributes and thus make inferences misaligned with human perception. While vision representations have previously benefited from alignment in contexts like image generation, the utility of perceptually aligned representations in more general-purpose settings remains unclear. Here, we investigate how aligning vision model representations to human perceptual judgments impacts their usability across diverse computer vision tasks. We finetune state-of-the-art models on human similarity judgments for image triplets and evaluate them across standard vision benchmarks. We find that aligning models to perceptual judgments yields representations that improve upon the original backbones across many downstream tasks, including counting, segmentation, depth estimation, instance retrieval, and retrieval-augmented generation. In addition, we find that performance is widely preserved on other tasks, including specialized out-of-distribution domains such as in medical imaging and 3D environment frames. Our results suggest that injecting an inductive bias about human perceptual knowledge into vision models can contribute to better representations."

      "abstract": "Robustness towards adversarial attacks is a vital property for classifiers in several applications such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, etc. Also, in such scenarios, where the cost of misclassification is very high, knowing when to abstain from prediction becomes crucial. A natural question is which surrogates can be used to ensure learning in scenarios where the input points are adversarially perturbed and the classifier can abstain from prediction? This paper aims to characterize and design surrogates calibrated in \"Adversarial Robust Reject Option\" setting. First, we propose an adversarial robust reject option loss $\\ell_{d}^{\\gamma}$ and analyze it for the hypothesis set of linear classifiers ($\\mathcal{H}_{\\textrm{lin}}$). Next, we provide a complete characterization result for any surrogate to be $(\\ell_{d}^{\\gamma},\\mathcal{H}_{\\textrm{lin}})$- calibrated. To demonstrate the difficulty in designing surrogates to $\\ell_{d}^{\\gamma}$, we show negative calibration results for convex surrogates and quasi-concave conditional risk cases (these gave positive calibration in adversarial setting without reject option). We also empirically argue that Shifted Double Ramp Loss (DRL) and Shifted Double Sigmoid Loss (DSL) satisfy the calibration conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of shifted DRL and shifted DSL against adversarial perturbations on a synthetically generated dataset.",

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.",

      "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of brain abnormalities is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of complementary multi-parametric MRI imaging data. There is significant potential to develop a universal pre-training model that can be quickly adapted for image modalities and various clinical scenarios. However, current models often rely on uni-modal image data, neglecting the cross-modal correlations among different image modalities or struggling to scale up pre-training in the presence of missing modality data. In this paper, we propose BrainMVP, a multi-modal vision pre-training framework for brain image analysis using multi-parametric MRI scans. First, we collect 16,022 brain MRI scans (over 2.4 million images), encompassing eight MRI modalities sourced from a diverse range of centers and devices. Then, a novel pre-training paradigm is proposed for the multi-modal MRI data, addressing the issue of missing modalities and achieving multi-modal information fusion. Cross-modal reconstruction is explored to learn distinctive brain image embeddings and efficient modality fusion capabilities. A modality-wise data distillation module is proposed to extract the essence representation of each MR image modality for both the pre-training and downstream application purposes. Furthermore, we introduce a modality-aware contrastive learning module to enhance the cross-modality association within a study. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art pre-training methods in the medical domain, with Dice Score improvement of 0.28%-14.47% across six segmentation benchmarks and a consistent accuracy improvement of 0.65%-18.07% in four individual classification tasks."

      "abstract": "Whole heart segmentation (WHS) supports cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, disease monitoring, treatment planning, and prognosis. Deep learning has become the most widely used method for WHS applications in recent years. However, segmentation of whole-heart structures faces numerous challenges including heart shape variability during the cardiac cycle, clinical artifacts like motion and poor contrast-to-noise ratio, domain shifts in multi-center data, and the distinct modalities of CT and MRI. To address these limitations and improve segmentation quality, this paper introduces a new topology-preserving module that is integrated into deep neural networks. The implementation achieves anatomically plausible segmentation by using learned topology-preserving fields, which are based entirely on 3D convolution and are therefore very effective for 3D voxel data. We incorporate natural constraints between structures into the end-to-end training and enrich the feature representation of the neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on an open-source medical heart dataset, specifically using the WHS++ data. The results demonstrate that the architecture performs exceptionally well, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.939 during testing. This indicates full topology preservation for individual structures and significantly outperforms other baselines in preserving the overall scene topology."

In a preliminary step, the measured data is divided in gates corresponding to motion states, and displacement maps from a reference state to each motion state are estimated. One common technique to perform motion correction is the motion compensated image reconstruction framework, where the displacement maps are integrated into the forward model corresponding to gated data. For standard algorithms, the computational cost per iteration increases linearly with the number of gates. In order to accelerate the reconstruction, we propose the use of a randomized and convergent algorithm whose per iteration computational cost scales constantly with the number of gates. We show improvement on theoretical rates of convergence and observe the predicted speed-up on two synthetic datasets corresponding to rigid and non-rigid motion."

      "abstract": "Passive and effective fluid capture and transport at small scale is crucial for industrial and medical applications, especially for the realisation of point-of-care tests. Performing these tests involves several steps including biological fluid capture, aliquoting, reaction with reagents at the fluid-device interface, and reading of the results. Ideally, these tests must be fast and offer a large surface-to-volume ratio to achieve rapid and precise diagnostics with a reduced amount of fluid. Such constraints are often contradictory as a high surface-to-volume ratio implies a high hydraulic resistance and hence a decrease in the flow rate. Inspired by the feeding mechanism of hummingbirds, we propose a frugal fluid capture device that takes advantage of elastocapillary deformations to enable concomitant fast liquid transport, aliquoting, and high confinement in the deformed state. The hierarchical design of the device - that consists in vertical grooves stacked on an elastic sheet - enables a two-step sequential fluid capture. Each unit groove mimics the hummingbird's tongue and closes due to capillary forces when a wetting liquid penetrates, yielding the closure of the whole device in a tubular shape, where additional liquid is captured. Combining elasticity, capillarity, and viscous flow, we rationalise the fluid-structure interaction at play both when liquid is scarce - end dipping and capillary rise - and abundant - full dipping. By functionalising the surface of the grooves such a passive device can concomitantly achieve all the steps of point-of-care tests, opening the way for the design of optimal devices for fluid capture and transport in microfluidics."

      "abstract": "The combination of semi-supervised learning (SemiSL) and contrastive learning (CL) has been successful in medical image segmentation with limited annotations. However, these works often rely on pretext tasks that lack the specificity required for pixel-level segmentation, and still face overfitting issues due to insufficient supervision signals resulting from too few annotations. Therefore, this paper proposes an affinity-graph-guided semi-supervised contrastive learning framework (Semi-AGCL) by establishing additional affinity-graph-based supervision signals between the student and teacher network, to achieve medical image segmentation with minimal annotations without pretext. The framework first designs an average-patch-entropy-driven inter-patch sampling method, which can provide a robust initial feature space without relying on pretext tasks. Furthermore, the framework designs an affinity-graph-guided loss function, which can improve the quality of the learned representation and the model generalization ability by exploiting the inherent structure of the data, thus mitigating overfitting. Our experiments indicate that with merely 10% of the complete annotation set, our model approaches the accuracy of the fully annotated baseline, manifesting a marginal deviation of only 2.52%. Under the stringent conditions where only 5% of the annotations are employed, our model exhibits a significant enhancement in performance surpassing the second best baseline by 23.09% on the dice metric and achieving an improvement of 26.57% on the notably arduous CRAG and ACDC datasets."

      "abstract": "In medical image synthesis, the precision of localized structural details is crucial, particularly when addressing specific clinical requirements such as the identification and measurement of fine structures. Traditional methods for image translation and synthesis are generally optimized for global image reconstruction but often fall short in providing the finesse required for detailed local analysis. This study represents a step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a novel anatomical feature-prioritized (AFP) loss function into the synthesis process. This method enhances reconstruction by focusing on clinically significant structures, utilizing features from a pre-trained model designed for a specific downstream task, such as the segmentation of particular anatomical regions. The AFP loss function can replace or complement global reconstruction methods, ensuring a balanced emphasis on both global image fidelity and local structural details. Various implementations of this loss function are explored, including its integration into different synthesis networks such as GAN-based and CNN-based models. Our approach is applied and evaluated in two contexts: lung MR to CT translation, focusing on high-quality reconstruction of bronchial structures, using a private dataset; and pelvis MR to CT synthesis, targeting the accurate representation of organs and muscles, utilizing a public dataset from the Synthrad2023 challenge. We leverage embeddings from pre-trained segmentation models specific to these anatomical regions to demonstrate the capability of the AFP loss to prioritize and accurately reconstruct essential features. This tailored approach shows promising potential for enhancing the specificity and practicality of medical image synthesis in clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Current zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods show remarkable success in prompting large pre-trained vision-language models to detect anomalies in a target dataset without using any dataset-specific training or demonstration. However, these methods are often focused on crafting/learning prompts that capture only coarse-grained semantics of abnormality, e.g., high-level semantics like \"damaged\", \"imperfect\", or \"defective\" on carpet. They therefore have limited capability in recognizing diverse abnormality details with distinctive visual appearance, e.g., specific defect types like color stains, cuts, holes, and threads on carpet. To address this limitation, we propose FAPrompt, a novel framework designed to learn Fine-grained Abnormality Prompts for more accurate ZSAD. To this end, we introduce a novel compound abnormality prompting module in FAPrompt to learn a set of complementary, decomposed abnormality prompts, where each abnormality prompt is formed by a compound of shared normal tokens and a few learnable abnormal tokens. On the other hand, the fine-grained abnormality patterns can be very different from one dataset to another. To enhance their cross-dataset generalization, we further introduce a data-dependent abnormality prior module that learns to derive abnormality features from each query/test image as a sample-wise abnormality prior to ground the abnormality prompts in a given target dataset. Comprehensive experiments conducted across 19 real-world datasets, covering both industrial defects and medical anomalies, demonstrate that FAPrompt substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 3%-5% AUC/AP in both image- and pixel-level ZSAD tasks.
