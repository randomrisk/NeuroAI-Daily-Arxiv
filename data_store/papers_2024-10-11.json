      "abstract": "Computer science theory provides many different measures of complexity of a system including Kolmogorov complexity, logical depth, computational depth, and Levin complexity. However, these measures are all defined only for deterministic Turing machines, i.e., deterministic dynamics of the underlying generative process whose output we are interested in. Therefore, by construction they cannot capture complexity of the output of stochastic processes - like those in the real world. Motivated by this observation, we combine probabilistic Turing machines with a prior over the inputs to the Turing machine to define a complete stochastic process of Turing machines. We call this a stochastic process Turing machine. Stochastic process Turing machines allow us to formalize a stochastic generalization of logical depth called stochastic depth, and also to apply stochastic thermodynamics to the analysis of Turing machines. Stochastic process Turing machines and stochastic depth allow us to study the complex, stochastic systems like the human brain, societies, and evolution all from within the framework of formal computation."

      "abstract": "Scientific research often seeks to understand the causal structure underlying high-level variables in a system. For example, climate scientists study how phenomena, such as El Ni\\~no, affect other climate processes at remote locations across the globe. However, scientists typically collect low-level measurements, such as geographically distributed temperature readings. From these, one needs to learn both a mapping to causally-relevant latent variables, such as a high-level representation of the El Ni\\~no phenomenon and other processes, as well as the causal model over them. The challenge is that this task, called causal representation learning, is highly underdetermined from observational data alone, requiring other constraints during learning to resolve the indeterminacies. In this work, we consider a temporal model with a sparsity assumption, namely single-parent decoding: each observed low-level variable is only affected by a single latent variable. Such an assumption is reasonable in many scientific applications that require finding groups of low-level variables, such as extracting regions from geographically gridded measurement data in climate research or capturing brain regions from neural activity data. We demonstrate the identifiability of the resulting model and propose a differentiable method, Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD), that simultaneously learns the underlying latents and a causal graph over them. We assess the validity of our theoretical results using simulated data and showcase the practical validity of our method in an application to real-world data from the climate science field.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing interest in developing the theoretical foundations of networked control systems that illuminate how brain networks function so as to enable sensory perception, control of movement, memory and all the operations that are needed for animals to survive. The present paper proposes a biologically inspired network model featuring dynamic connections regulated by Hebbian learning. Drawing on the machinery of graph theory and classical control we show that our novel nonlinear model exhibits such biologically plausible features as bounded evolution, stability, resilience, and a kind of structural stability -- meaning that perturbations of the model parameters leave the essential properties of the model in tact. The proposed network model involves generalized cactus graphs with multiple control input nodes, and it is shown that the properties of the network are resilient to various changes in network topology provided these changes preserve the generalized cactus structure. A particular example described in what follows is an idealized network model of the visual system of a macaque monkey. The model displays resilience to network disruptions such as might occur in a living organism due to disease or injury. A different model of the same type provides an example of a system that can perform data classification."

      "abstract": "Anatomical connectivity between different regions in the brain can be mapped to a network representation, the connectome, where the intensities of the links, the weights, influence its structural resilience and the functional processes it sustains. Yet, many features associated with the weights in the human brain connectome are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale organization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights, including weak ties, in multiscale hierarchical human brain connectomes reconstructed from empirical data. Our findings reveal multiscale self-similarity in the weighted statistical properties, including the ordering of weak ties, that remain consistent across the analyzed length scales of every individual and the group representatives. This phenomenon is effectively captured by a renormalization of the weighted structure applied to hyperbolic embeddings of the connectomes, based on a unique weighted geometric model that integrates links of all weights across all length scales. This eliminates the need for separate generative weighted connectivity rules for each scale or to replicate weak and strong ties at specific scales in brain connectomes. The observed symmetry represents a distinct signature of criticality in the weighted connectivity of human brain connectomes, aligning with the fractality observed in their topology, and raises important questions for future research, like the existence of a resolution threshold where the observed symmetry breaks, or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegenerative disease or psychiatric disorder."

This task yields sensory-motor conflict, and one might expect differences in behavior between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to considering spatially focused approaches, such as FC, as a biomarker, we also consider temporal biomarkers, which are more sensitive to ongoing changes in neural activity. We find that FC, estimated from delta (1-4Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) oscillations, yields spatial FC patterns significantly better at distinguishing PD from HC than temporal features or behavior. This study reinforces that FC in spectral bands is informative of differences in brain-wide processes and can serve as a biomarker distinguishing normal brain function from that seen in disease."

      "abstract": "Attractor neural networks consider that neural information is stored as stationary states of a dynamical system formed by a large number of interconnected neurons. The attractor property empowers a neural system to encode information robustly, but it also incurs the difficulty of rapid update of network states, which can impair information update and search in the brain. To overcome this difficulty, a solution is to include adaptation in the attractor network dynamics, whereby the adaptation serves as a slow negative feedback mechanism to destabilize which are otherwise permanently stable states. In such a way, the neural system can, on one hand, represent information reliably using attractor states, and on the other hand, perform computations wherever rapid state updating is involved. Previous studies have shown that continuous attractor neural networks with adaptation (A-CANNs) exhibits rich dynamical behaviors accounting for various brain functions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of the rich diverse dynamics of A-CANNs. Moreover, we provide a unified mathematical framework to understand these different dynamical behaviors, and briefly discuss about their biological implications."

We evaluate our method on the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, a heterogeneous collection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from four independent medical centers. SSS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across most medical centers, and superior performance on all out-of-distribution (OOD) unseen medical centers. Additionally, SSS naturally provides post-hoc insights into local signal characteristics related to the SOZ, by visualizing temporally averaged local predictions throughout the signal."

      "abstract": "Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are widely used for recovering the conditional independence structure among random variables. Recently, several key advances have been made to exploit an additional set of variables for better estimating the GGMs of the variables of interest. For example, in co-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, both the mean expression level of genes as well as their pairwise conditional independence structure may be adjusted by genetic variants local to those genes. Existing methods to estimate covariate-adjusted GGMs either allow only the mean to depend on covariates or suffer from poor scaling assumptions due to the inherent non-convexity of simultaneously estimating the mean and precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a convex formulation that jointly estimates the covariate-adjusted mean and precision matrix by utilizing the natural parametrization of the multivariate Gaussian likelihood. This convexity yields theoretically better performance as the sparsity and dimension of the covariates grow large relative to the number of samples. We verify our theoretical results with numerical simulations and perform a reanalysis of an eQTL study of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive form of brain cancer."

Such systems with higher-order interactions can be well described by a simplicial complex (SC), which is a type of hypergraph, consisting of simplexes representing sets of multiple interacting nodes. Here, capturing the properties of growing real-world systems, we propose a growing random SC (GRSC) model where a node is added and a higher dimensional simplex is established among nodes at each time step. We then rigorously derive various percolation properties in the GRSC. Finally, we confirm that the system exhibits an infinite-order phase transition as higher-order interactions accelerate the growth of the system and result in the advanced emergence of a giant cluster. This work can pave the way for interpreting growing complex systems with higher-order interactions such as social, biological, brain, and technological systems."

Thus, if the subject-specific optimal phase is known, stimulation can be timed to be more efficient. In this paper, we present a closed-loop algorithm to determine the optimal phase linked to the highest excitability with few trials. We used Bayesian optimization as an automated, online search tool in an EEG-TMS simulation experiment. From a sample of 38 participants, we selected all participants with a significant single-subject phase effect (N = 5) for simulation. We then simulated 1000 experimental sessions per participant where we used Bayesian optimization to find the optimal phase. We tested two objective functions: Fitting a sinusoid in Bayesian linear regression or Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We additionally tested adaptive sampling using a knowledge gradient as the acquisition function compared with random sampling. We evaluated the algorithm's performance in a fast optimization (100 trials) and a long-term optimization (1000 trials). For fast optimization, the Bayesian linear regression in combination with adaptive sampling gives the best results with a mean phase location accuracy of 79 % after 100 trials. With either sampling approach, Bayesian linear regression performs better than GP regression in the fast optimization. In the long-term optimization, Bayesian regression with random sampling shows the best trajectory, with a rather steep improvement and good final performance of 87 % mean phase location accuracy. We show the suitability of closed-loop Bayesian optimization for phase selection. We could increase the speed and accuracy by using prior knowledge about the expected function shape compared with traditional Bayesian optimization with GP regression."

The unpredictability of seizure occurrences, which causes safety issues as well as social concerns, restrict the lifestyles of DRE patients. Surgical solutions and EEG-based solutions are very expensive, unreliable, invasive or impractical. The goal of this research was to employ improved technologies and methods to epilepsy patient physiological data and predict seizures up to two hours before onset, enabling non-invasive, affordable seizure prediction for DRE patients.   Methods: This research used a 1D Convolutional Neural Network-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network that was trained on a diverse set of epileptic patient physiological data to predict seizures. Transfer learning was further utilized to personalize and optimize predictions for specific patients. Clinical data was retrospectively obtained for nine epilepsy patients via wearable devices over a period of about three to five days from a prospectively maintained database. The physiological data included 54 seizure occurrences and included heart rate, blood volume pulse, accelerometry, body temperature, and electrodermal activity.   Results and Conclusion: A general deep-learning model trained on the physiological data with randomly sampled test data achieved an accuracy of 91.94%. However, such a generalized deep learning model had varied performances on data from unseen patients. When the general model was personalized (further trained) with patient-specific data, the personalized model achieved significantly improved performance with accuracies as high as 97%. This preliminary research shows that patient-specific personalization may be a viable approach to achieve affordable, non-invasive seizure prediction that can improve the quality of life for DRE patients."

      "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities."

This pipeline integrates: a new pre-processing technique which segments continuous raw EEG signals without prior distinction between seizure and seizure-free activities; a post-processing algorithm developed to reassemble EEG segments and allow the identification of seizures start/end; and finally, a new evaluation procedure based on a strict seizure events comparison between predicted and real labels.

We first characterize the measurement uncertainty distribution of a common ADC and show that it quantitatively conforms to a Gaussian distribution. We then evaluate the effect of measurement uncertainty on the artifact identification process through several computer simulations. These computer simulations evaluate the performance of two different ICA algorithms, FastICA and Infomax, in removing eyeblink artifacts from five different electrode configurations with varying levels of measurement uncertainty. FastICA and Infomax show similar performance in identifying the eyeblink artifacts for a given uncertainty level and electrode configuration. We quantify the correlation performance degradation with respect to SNR and show that in general, an SNR of greater than 15 dB results in less than a 5% degradation in performance. The biggest difference in performance between the two algorithms is in their execution time. FastICA's execution time is dependent on the amount of measurement uncertainty, with a 50% to 85% reduction in execution time over an SNR range of 20 dB.

Inappropriate evaluation setups that either exploit or overlook these features can lead to artificially inflated classification performance (by up to 50% in accuracy on ADFTD dataset): this concern has received little attention in current research. Here, we categorize the existing evaluation setups into two primary categories: subject-dependent and subject-independent. We show the subject-independent setup is more appropriate for different datasets and tasks. Our theoretical analysis explores the feature components of MedTS, examining how different evaluation setups influence the features that a model learns. Through experiments on six datasets (spanning EEG, ECG, and fNIRS modalities) using four different methods, we demonstrate step-by-step how subject-dependent utilizes subject-specific features as a shortcut for classification and leads to a deceptive high performance, suggesting that the subject-independent setup is more precise and practicable evaluation setup in real-world.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in humanoid robotics, including the integration of hierarchical reinforcement learning-based control and the utilization of LLM planning, have significantly enhanced the ability of robots to perform complex tasks. In contrast to the highly developed humanoid robots, the human factors involved remain relatively unexplored. Directly controlling humanoid robots with the brain has already appeared in many science fiction novels, such as Pacific Rim and Gundam. In this work, we present E2H (EEG-to-Humanoid), an innovative framework that pioneers the control of humanoid robots using high-frequency non-invasive neural signals. As the none-invasive signal quality remains low in decoding precise spatial trajectory, we decompose the E2H framework in an innovative two-stage formation: 1) decoding neural signals (EEG) into semantic motion keywords, 2) utilizing LLM facilitated motion generation with a precise motion imitation control policy to realize humanoid robotics control. The method of directly driving robots with brainwave commands offers a novel approach to human-machine collaboration, especially in situations where verbal commands are impractical, such as in cases of speech impairments, space exploration, or underwater exploration, unlocking significant potential. E2H offers an exciting glimpse into the future, holding immense potential for human-computer interaction."

Yet, a mechanistic computational model of each individual learning trajectory is required to improve the reliability of BCI applications. The few existing attempts mostly rely on model-free (reinforcement learning) approaches. Hence, they cannot capture the strategy developed by each subject and neither finely predict their learning curve. In this study, we propose an alternative, model-based approach rooted in cognitive skill learning within the Active Inference framework. We show how BCI training may be framed as an inference problem under high uncertainties. We illustrate the proposed approach on a previously published synthetic Motor Imagery ERD laterality training. We show how simple changes in model parameters allow us to qualitatively match experimental results and account for various subject. In the near future, this approach may provide a powerful computational to model individual skill learning and thus optimize and finely characterize BCI training."

Lightweight bag-level representations are extracted from image modalities and a Shapley-value-based mechanism is used for dimension reduction. For each dimension of the bag-level representation, attribution values are calculated to indicate how changes in the specific dimensions of the input affect the model output. In this way, we select a few top important dimensions of bag-level representation for each image modality to late fusion.

However, existing EEG attacks mainly focus on single-target class attacks, and they either require engaging the training stage of the target BCI, or fail to maintain high stealthiness. Addressing these limitations, Professor X exploits a three-stage clean label poisoning attack: 1) selecting one trigger for each class; 2) learning optimal injecting EEG electrodes and frequencies strategy with reinforcement learning for each trigger; 3) generating poisoned samples by injecting the corresponding trigger's frequencies into poisoned data for each class by linearly interpolating the spectral amplitude of both data according to previously learned strategies. Experiments on datasets of three common EEG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Professor X, which also easily bypasses existing backdoor defenses."

The model treats the EEG classification of each individual as an independent task and facilitates feature sharing across individuals. Our model consists of an impulsive neural population coupled with a convolutional encoder-decoder to extract shared features and a bidirectional associative memory matrix to map features to class. Experimental results in two BCI competition datasets show that our model improves average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and reduces performance variance across individuals, and the waveforms reconstructed by the bidirectional associative memory provide interpretability for the model's classification results. The neuronal firing patterns in our model are highly coordinated, similarly to the neural coding of hippocampal neurons, indicating that our model has biological similarities."

Each device promises better clinical outcomes and quality-of-life improvements, yet due to severe and inflexible safety constraints, progress requires tight co-design from materials to circuits and all the way up the stack to applications and algorithms. This trend has become more aggressive over time, forcing clinicians and patients to rely on vendor-specific hardware and software for deployment, maintenance, upgrades, and replacement. This over-reliance is ethically problematic, especially if companies go out-of-business or business objectives diverge from clinical promises. Device heterogeneity additionally burdens clinicians and healthcare facilities, adding complexity and costs for in-clinic visits, monitoring, and continuous access.   Reliability, interoperability, portability, and future-proofed design is needed, but this unfortunately comes at a cost. These system features sap resources that would have otherwise been allocated to reduce power/energy and improve performance. Navigating this trade-off in a systematic way is critical to providing patients with forever access to their implants and reducing burdens placed on healthcare providers and caretakers. We study the integration of on-device storage to highlight the sensitivity of this trade-off and establish other points of interest within BCI design that require careful investigation. In the process, we revisit relevant problems in computer architecture and medical devices from the current era of hardware specialization and modern neurotechnology."

We designed a closed-loop system for motor augmentation using an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to cue users' volitional finger tapping. Relying on the readiness potentials, the system autonomously cued the finger movement at the time of the intent to interact via electrical muscle stimulation (EMS).

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use."

To make significant progress toward precise source orientation detection and improved signal reconstruction, we introduce the Accelerated Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (ALCMV) beamforming toolbox and the Accelerated Brain Source Orientation Detection (AORI) toolbox. The ALCMV algorithm speeds up EEG source reconstruction by utilizing recursive covariance matrix calculations, while AORI simplifies source orientation detection from three dimensions to one, reducing computational load by 66% compared to conventional methods. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we demonstrate that these algorithms maintain high accuracy, with orientation errors below 0.2% and signal reconstruction accuracy within 2%. These findings suggest that the proposed toolboxes represent a substantial advancement in the efficiency and speed of EEG source localization, making them well-suited for real-time neurotechnological applications."

In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models."

      "abstract": "The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles."

However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities."

Deep Learning (DL) Super-Resolution (SR) methods have emerged as a promising solution to enhance fMRI resolution, generating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images typically acquired with lower scanning times.

ECHO video generation offers a solution by improving automated monitoring through synthetic data and generating high-quality videos from routine health data. However, existing models often face high computational costs, slow inference, and rely on complex conditional prompts that require experts' annotations. To address these challenges, we propose ECHOPULSE, an ECG-conditioned ECHO video generation model. ECHOPULSE introduces two key advancements: (1) it accelerates ECHO video generation by leveraging VQ-VAE tokenization and masked visual token modeling for fast decoding, and (2) it conditions on readily accessible ECG signals, which are highly coherent with ECHO videos, bypassing complex conditional prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use time-series prompts like ECG signals for ECHO video generation. ECHOPULSE not only enables controllable synthetic ECHO data generation but also provides updated cardiac function information for disease monitoring and prediction beyond ECG alone. Evaluations on three public and private datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in ECHO video generation across both qualitative and quantitative measures.

We demonstrate our method through simulations and through its application to real resting-state fMRI data from a study focusing on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Our approach sheds light on the intricate interplay between brain connectivity and clinical features, offering insights that can contribute to our understanding of psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as mental health."

      "abstract": "Identifying unusual brain activity is a crucial task in neuroscience research, as it aids in the early detection of brain disorders. It is common to represent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various graph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority of existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the following three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise correlations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture synchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the brain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the brain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy or disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns linked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we present HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal hypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel customized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal co-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain in both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all other baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks. Furthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical research on these brain disorders. Our findings suggest that learning temporal and higher-order connections in the brain provides a promising approach to uncover intricate connectivity patterns in brain networks, offering improved diagnosis.",

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \\( t \\) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \\( t \\) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject."

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions."

We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal."

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties.

However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "Scintillators are essential for converting X-ray energy into visible light in imaging technologies. Their widespread application in imaging technologies has been enabled by scalable, high-quality, and affordable manufacturing methods. Nanophotonic scintillators, which feature nanostructures at the scale of their emission wavelength, provide a promising approach to enhance emission properties like light yield, decay time, and directionality. However, scalable fabrication of such nanostructured scintillators has been a significant challenge, impeding their widespread adoption. Here, we present a scalable fabrication method for large-area nanophotonic scintillators based on the self-assembly of chalcogenide glass photonic crystals. This technique enables the production of nanophotonic scintillators over wafer-scale areas, achieving a six-fold enhancement in light yield compared to unpatterned scintillators. We demonstrate this approach using a conventional X-ray scintillator material, cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce). By analyzing the influence of surface nanofabrication disorder, we establish its effect on imaging performance and provide a route towards large-scale scintillation enhancements without decrease in spatial resolution. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our nanophotonic scintillators through X-ray imaging of biological and inorganic specimens. Our results indicate that this scalable fabrication technique could enable the industrial implementation of a new generation of nanophotonic-enhanced scintillators, with significant implications for advancements in medical imaging, security screening, and nondestructive testing."

      "abstract": "Radiologists play a crucial role by translating medical images into medical reports. However, the field faces staffing shortages and increasing workloads. While automated approaches using vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as assistants, they require exceptionally high accuracy. Most current VLMs in radiology rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Meanwhile, in the general domain, additional preference fine-tuning has become standard practice. The challenge in radiology lies in the prohibitive cost of obtaining radiologist feedback. We propose a scalable automated preference alignment technique for VLMs in radiology, focusing on chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. Our method leverages publicly available datasets with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, eliminating the need for additional expert radiologist feedback. We evaluate and benchmark five direct alignment algorithms (DAAs). Our results show up to a 57.4% improvement in average GREEN scores, a LLM-based metric for evaluating CXR reports, and a 9.2% increase in an average across six metrics (domain specific and general), compared to the SFT baseline. We study reward overoptimization via length exploitation, with reports lengthening by up to 3.2x. To assess a potential alignment tax, we benchmark on six additional diverse tasks, finding no significant degradations. A reader study involving four board-certified radiologists indicates win rates of up to 0.62 over the SFT baseline, while significantly penalizing verbosity. Our analysis provides actionable insights for the development of VLMs in high-stakes fields like radiology."

      "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, and X-rays are commonly used for its diagnosis due to their cost-effectiveness. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), on the other hand, offers detailed soft tissue visualization and has become a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool for KOA. Unfortunately, the high cost and limited accessibility of MRI hinder its widespread use, leaving many patients with KOA reliant solely on X-ray imaging. In this study, we introduce a novel diffusion-based Xray2MRI model capable of generating pseudo-MRI volumes from one single X-ray image. In addition to using X-rays as conditional input, our model integrates target depth, KOA probability distribution, and image intensity distribution modules to guide the synthesis process, ensuring that the generated corresponding slices accurately correspond to the anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate that by integrating information from X-rays with additional input data, our proposed approach is capable of generating pseudo-MRI sequences that approximate real MRI scans. Moreover, by increasing the inference times, the model achieves effective interpolation, further improving the continuity and smoothness of the generated MRI sequences, representing one promising initial attempt for cost-effective medical imaging solutions."

      "abstract": "The medical image processing field often encounters the critical issue of scarce annotated data. Transfer learning has emerged as a solution, yet how to select an adequate source task and effectively transfer the knowledge to the target task remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel sequential transfer scheme with a task affinity metric tailored for medical images. Considering the characteristics of medical image segmentation tasks, we analyze the image and label similarity between tasks and compute the task affinity scores, which assess the relatedness among tasks. Based on this, we select appropriate source tasks and develop an effective sequential transfer strategy by incorporating intermediate source tasks to gradually narrow the domain discrepancy and minimize the transfer cost. Thereby we identify the best sequential transfer path for the given target task. Extensive experiments on three MRI medical datasets, FeTS 2022, iSeg-2019, and WMH, demonstrate the efficacy of our method in finding the best source sequence. Compared with directly transferring from a single source task, the sequential transfer results underline a significant improvement in target task performance, achieving an average of 2.58% gain in terms of segmentation Dice score, notably, 6.00% for FeTS 2022.

The Real-World Evidence Scientific Working Group of the American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Section has been reviewing the field of DCTs and provides in this paper considerations for decentralized trials from a statistical perspective. This paper first discusses selected critical decentralized elements that may have statistical implications on the trial and then summarizes regulatory guidance, framework, and initiatives on DCTs. More discussions are presented by focusing on the design (including construction of estimand), implementation, statistical analysis plan (including missing data handling), and reporting of safety events. Some additional considerations (e.g., ethical considerations, technology infrastructure, study oversight, data security and privacy, and regulatory compliance) are also briefly discussed. This paper is intended to provide statistical considerations for decentralized trials of medical products to support regulatory decision-making."

MedImageInsight is trained on medical images with associated text and labels across a diverse collection of domains, including X-Ray, CT, MRI, dermoscopy, OCT, fundus photography, ultrasound, histopathology, and mammography. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate MedImageInsight's ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) or human expert level performance across classification, image-image search, and fine-tuning tasks. Specifically, on public datasets, MedImageInsight achieves SOTA in CT 3D medical image retrieval, as well as SOTA in disease classification and search for chest X-ray, dermatology, and OCT imaging. Furthermore, MedImageInsight achieves human expert performance in bone age estimation (on both public and partner data), as well as AUC above 0.9 in most other domains. When paired with a text decoder, MedImageInsight achieves near SOTA level single image report findings generation with less than 10\\% the parameters of other models. Compared to fine-tuning GPT-4o with only MIMIC-CXR data for the same task, MedImageInsight outperforms in clinical metrics, but underperforms on lexical metrics where GPT-4o sets a new SOTA. Importantly for regulatory purposes, MedImageInsight can generate ROC curves, adjust sensitivity and specificity based on clinical need, and provide evidence-based decision support through image-image search (which can also enable retrieval augmented generation). In an independent clinical evaluation of image-image search in chest X-ray, MedImageInsight outperformed every other publicly available foundation model evaluated by large margins (over 6 points AUC), and significantly outperformed other models in terms of AI fairness (across age and gender). We hope releasing MedImageInsight will help enhance collective progress in medical imaging AI research and development."
