      "abstract": "Objectives: Permissible limits have been established by international guidelines and standards for human protection to electromagnetic field exposure to prevent adverse health effects stemming from electrostimulation in the most sensitive body part. That is the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the intermediate frequency range (300 Hz to 100 kHz) and the central nervous system (CNS) at lower frequencies. However, there is a need to reevaluate protection limits against CNS electrostimulation in the intermediate frequency range, considering the importance of brain tissues during electromagnetic head exposure. This study aims to derive the level of CNS cortical stimulation to evaluate compliance with existing protection limits. Method: Multi-scale computation modelling was used to evaluate neuron stimulation thresholds by integrating individual neurons into realistic anatomical head models. Five different excitable membrane models within the motor cortex were examined across three human head models, providing the most comprehensive and extensive evaluation to date. Results: Current protection limits are confirmed as conservative, with non-compliance observed in only 0.02% and 2.4% of axons under clamped and sealed boundary conditions, respectively. The study highlights significant intersubject variability (up to 600% mean threshold) and clarifies the influence of neural excitation models on permissible level assessments. Conclusion: Current electric field limits are conservative for CNS electrostimulation in the intermediate frequencies range, but the margin of safety decreases at higher frequencies, warranting further evaluation. Impact: The findings and methodology contribute to the rationale and provide valuable insights for revising electromagnetic safety exposure guidelines."

While clustering algorithms have been proposed for PET analysis already earlier, there is still little research systematically evaluating these algorithms for processing of dynamic total-body PET images. Materials and methods. Here, we compare the performance of 15 unsupervised clustering methods, including K-means either by itself or after principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and several newer clustering algorithms, for classifying time activity curves (TACs) in dynamic PET images. We use dynamic total-body $^{15}$O-water PET images collected from 30 patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease. To evaluate the clustering algorithms in a quantitative way, we use them to classify 5000 TACs from each image based on whether the curve is taken from brain, right heart ventricle, right kidney, lower right lung lobe, or urinary bladder. Results. According to our results, the best methods are GMM, FCM, and ICA combined with mini batch K-means, which classified the TACs with a median accuracies of 89\\%, 83\\%, and 81\\%, respectively, in a processing time of half a second or less on average for each image. Conclusion. GMM, FCM, and ICA with mini batch K-means show promise for dynamic total-body PET analysis."

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework is presented allowing for dissimilar current distribution across active contacts. MILP is compared to a Linear Programming (LP) approach in terms of computational efficiency and activation accuracy. Results from ten Parkinson's disease patients treated with DBS show that while MILP better matches the predefined stimulation target activation profile, LP solutions more closely resemble clinically applied settings, suggesting the profile may not fully capture clinically relevant patterns. Additionally, MILP's limitations are discussed, including its reliance on precisely defined target regions and its computational burden for larger target sets."

      "abstract": "This paper is a shorten version of the full paper that was published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology in May 2022. In recent decades, the scientific study of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this elusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of the functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory regarding its phenomenal aspect. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the first-person answer to what it is like question, and it has thus far proved recalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. The question of how the brain, or any cognitive system, can create conscious experience out of neural representations poses a great conundrum to science. Naturalistic dualists argue that it is composed of a primitive, private, nonreductive element of reality. Illusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion. We contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because they tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that does not depend on the observer. We developed a conceptual and a mathematical argument for a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or does not have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. According to the theory, Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just relativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be observable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will not (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are both correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest while another will claim that the observer has constant velocity. Neither observer position can be privileged, as they both describe the same underlying reality."

This has created an urgent need for a novel, energy-efficient computational fabric to replace the current computing pipeline. Recently, a promising approach has emerged by mimicking spiking neurons in the brain and leveraging oscillators on CMOS for direct computation. In this context, we propose a new and energy efficient machine learning framework implemented on CMOS Oscillator Networks (OscNet). We model the developmental processes of the prenatal brain's visual system using OscNet, updating weights based on the biologically inspired Hebbian rule. This same pipeline is then directly applied to standard machine learning tasks. OscNet is a specially designed hardware and is inherently energy-efficient. Its reliance on forward propagation alone for training further enhances its energy efficiency while maintaining biological plausibility. Simulation validates our designs of OscNet architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that Hebbian learning pipeline on OscNet achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing traditional machine learning algorithms, highlighting its potential as a energy efficient and effective computational paradigm."

      "abstract": "The choroid, a highly vascular layer behind the retina, is an extension of the central nervous system and has parallels with the renal cortex, with blood flow far exceeding that of the brain and kidney. Thus, there has been growing interest of choroidal blood flow reflecting physiological status of systemic disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution imaging of the choroid, but conventional analysis methods remain manual or semi-automatic, limiting reproducibility, standardisation and clinical utility. In this thesis, I develop several new methods to analyse the choroid in OCT image sequences, with each successive method improving on its predecessors. I first develop two semi-automatic approaches for choroid region (Gaussian Process Edge Tracing, GPET) and vessel (Multi-scale Median Cut Quantisation, MMCQ) analysis, which improve on manual approaches but remain user-dependent. To address this, I introduce DeepGPET, a deep learning-based region segmentation method which improves on execution time, reproducibility, and end-user accessibility, but lacks choroid vessel analysis and automatic feature measurement. Improving on this, I developed Choroidalyzer, a deep learning-based pipeline to segment the choroidal space and vessels and generate fully automatic, clinically meaningful and reproducible choroidal features. I provide rigorous evaluation of these four approaches and consider their potential clinical value in three applications into systemic health: OCTANE, assessing choroidal changes in renal transplant recipients and donors; PREVENT, exploring choroidal associations with Alzheimer's risk factors at mid-life; D-RISCii, assessing choroidal variation and feasibility of OCT in critical care. In short, this thesis contributes many open-source tools for standardised choroidal measurement and highlights the choroid's potential as a biomarker in systemic health."

Even using a laptop CPU, the habitized model can achieve an average 800+ Hz decision-making frequency (faster than previous diffusion planners by orders of magnitude) on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks D4RL, while maintaining comparable or even higher performance compared to its corresponding diffusion planner. Our work proposes a fresh perspective of leveraging powerful diffusion models for real-world decision-making tasks. We also provide robust evaluations and analysis, offering insights from both biological and engineering perspectives for efficient and effective decision-making."

Key characteristics of typical disease include focal motor features at disease presentation, evolving through a caudocranial pattern into generalized dystonia, with prominent oromandibular, laryngeal, and cervical involvement. Although KMT2B-related disease is emerging as one of the most common causes of early-onset genetic dystonia, much remains to be understood about the full spectrum of the disease. We describe a cohort of 53 patients with KMT2B mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein-truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5 to 37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident at 6 months, 1 year, and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.012; disability, P = 0.009, P = 0.002, and P = 0.012)."

One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by globally explaining spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, we introduce a method to retrieve the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compare it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We evaluate our approach on the MSA-CNN model using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. Our findings show that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-based spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN."

Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications."

The NC were estimated both globally for all channels (AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States (FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well they were correlated with the power of $\\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\\beta_1$ (15-25Hz) and others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher for AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies, we found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence the $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a consistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The $q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\\theta$ and negatively with that of the $\\beta_1$ band in general. These findings support the idea that, as a first approach, $q$-statistics can describe the human NC. The relationship between $q$ and $\\theta$ power aligns with greater NC during FSs such as listening music and resting with eyes open, which is consistent with high-order representations rather than low-informative attentional tasks (OddBall)."

Current watermarking methods, particularly those using abstract trigger sets, lack robust authentication and fail to address the unique challenges of EEG models. This paper introduces a cryptographic wonder filter-based watermarking framework tailored for EEG-based neural networks. Leveraging collision-resistant hashing and public-key encryption, the wonder filter embeds the watermark during training, ensuring minimal distortion ($\\leq 5\\%$ drop in EEG task accuracy) and high reliability (100\\% watermark detection). The framework is rigorously evaluated against adversarial attacks, including fine-tuning, transfer learning, and neuron pruning. Results demonstrate persistent watermark retention, with classification accuracy for watermarked states remaining above 90\\% even after aggressive pruning, while primary task performance degrades faster, deterring removal attempts. Piracy resistance is validated by the inability to embed secondary watermarks without severe accuracy loss ( $>10\\%$ in EEGNet and CCNN models). Cryptographic hashing ensures authentication, reducing brute-force attack success probabilities. Evaluated on the DEAP dataset across models (CCNN, EEGNet, TSception), the method achieves $>99.4\\%$ null-embedding accuracy, effectively eliminating false positives. By integrating wonder filters with EEG-specific adaptations, this work bridges a critical gap in IP protection for neurophysiological models, offering a secure, tamper-proof solution for healthcare and biometric applications.

The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial."

In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix."

It is widely used in neuroscience research, but the literature lacks established protocols in modalities that do not support healthy control measurements, such as intracranial EEG (icEEG). An icEEG normative map would allow researchers to learn about population-level brain activity and enable comparison of individual data against these norms to identify abnormalities. Currently, no standardised guide exists for transforming clinical data into a normative, regional icEEG map. Papers often cite different software and numerous articles to summarise the lengthy method, making it laborious for other researchers to understand or apply the process. Our protocol seeks to remedy this gap by providing a dataflow guide and key decision points that summarise existing methods. This protocol is used heavily in published works from our own lab (twelve peer-reviewed journal publications). Briefly, we take as input, icEEG recordings and neuroimaging data from people with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for resective surgery. As final outputs, we obtain a normative icEEG map, comprising signal properties localised to brain regions. Optionally, we can also process new subjects through the same pipeline and obtain their z-scores (or centiles) in each brain region, for abnormality detection and localisation. To date, a single, cohesive, dataflow pipeline for generating normative icEEG maps, along with abnormality mapping, has not been created. We envisage that this dataflow guide will not only increase understanding and application of normative mapping methods, but will also improve the consistency and quality of studies in the field."

The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial."

We are the first to explore such strategies across a large user group, as longitudinal adaptation is typically studied in the single-subject setting with a single adaptation strategy, which limits the ability to generalize findings. First, we examine the impact of different fine-tuning approaches on decoder performance and stability. Building on this, we integrate online test-time adaptation (OTTA) to adapt the model during deployment, complementing the effects of prior fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning that successively builds on prior subject-specific information improves both performance and stability, while OTTA effectively adapts the model to evolving data distributions across consecutive sessions, enabling calibration-free operation. These results offer valuable insights and recommendations for future research in longitudinal online MI decoding and highlight the importance of combining domain adaptation strategies for improving BCI performance in real-world applications.

In SSVEP BCI systems, supervised learning models significantly enhance performance over unsupervised models, achieving higher accuracy in less time. However, prolonged data collection can cause user fatigue and even trigger photosensitive epilepsy, creating a negative user experience. Thus, reducing calibration time is crucial. To address this, Cross-Stimulus transfer learning (CSTL) can shorten calibration by utilizing only partial frequencies. Traditional CSTL methods, affected by time-domain impulse response variations, are suitable only for adjacent frequency transfers, limiting their general applicability. We introduce an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) Based Fuzzy Model (EMD-Fuzzy), which employs EMD to extract crucial frequency information and achieves stimulus transfer in the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to mitigate time-domain differences. Combined with a Fuzzy Decoder that uses fuzzy logic for representation learning, our approach delivers promising preliminary results in offline tests and state-of-the-art performance. With only 4 frequencies, our method achieved an accuracy of 82.75% (16.30%) and an information transfer rate (ITR) of 186.56 (52.09) bits/min on the 40-target Benchmark dataset. In online tests, our method demonstrates robust efficacy, achieving an averaged accuracy of 86.30% (6.18%) across 7 subjects.

This limits their utility for brain computer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies not seen during training. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems.

Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain diseases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnostic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis."

With advancements in MRI technology, it has become feasible to decode intricate brain activities via multi-band frequency analysis (MBFA). During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI studies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain. There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands.

      "abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding neurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the generalizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy regulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) property of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose Domain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning framework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site settings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement, decomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data specificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning module enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We evaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its generalizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an enhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional connectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively, uncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings highlight the potential of DAFed to advance multi-site collaborative research in neuroimaging while protecting data confidentiality."

This often relies on manually labeled ROIs (Regions of Interest) to select brain voxels. However, these ROIs can contain redundant information and noise, reducing decoding performance. Additionally, the lack of automated ROI labeling methods hinders the practical application of fMRI visual decoding technology, especially for new subjects. This work presents TROI (Trainable Region of Interest), a novel two-stage, data-driven ROI labeling method for cross-subject fMRI decoding tasks, particularly when subject samples are limited. TROI leverages labeled ROIs in the dataset to pretrain an image decoding backbone on a cross-subject dataset, enabling efficient optimization of the input layer for new subjects without retraining the entire model from scratch. In the first stage, we introduce a voxel selection method that combines sparse mask training and low-pass filtering to quickly generate the voxel mask and determine input layer dimensions. In the second stage, we apply a learning rate rewinding strategy to fine-tune the input layer for downstream tasks. Experimental results on the same small sample dataset as the baseline method for brain visual retrieval and reconstruction tasks show that our voxel selection method surpasses the state-of-the-art method MindEye2 with an annotated ROI mask."

Brain network parameters-including activity levels of regions and their connectivity-reflect the integration and segregation of functional subnetworks underlying task processing. However, the complexity and high dimensionality of these parameters pose a significant barrier to identifying functionally relevant individual differences. Here, we introduce stiff-sloppy analysis as a framework for uncovering the stiff parameter combinations that critically influence task-state brain dynamics, exemplified by working memory. Using the pairwise maximum entropy model (PMEM) calibrated to fMRI data and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) analysis, we reveal that the stiff dimensions of the model parameters capture the most relevant integration and segregation processes of the default mode network and the working memory network. Individual differences along these stiff neural dimensions consistently correlate with working memory performance. Notably, stiff parameters robustly predicted working memory performance, even when the less sensitive (\"sloppy\") parameters were excluded. This study establishes stiff-sloppy analysis as a powerful approach to identify cognition-related brain networks, bridging neural dynamics and behavior and offering new avenues for personalized neuroscience including therapeutic innovation."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts.

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks.

Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings."

Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG."

We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

The proposed approach employs back-translation to generate diverse paraphrased datasets, improving robustness and mitigating overfitting in classification tasks. Leveraging Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention (DeBERTa) with Dynamic Contextual Positional Gating (DCPG), the model captures fine-grained contextual and positional relationships, dynamically adjusting the influence of positional information based on semantic context to produce high-quality text embeddings. For classification, an Attention-Based Feedforward Neural Network (ABFNN) is utilized, effectively focusing on the most relevant features to improve decision-making accuracy. Applied to the classification of symptoms, clinical notes, and other medical texts, this architecture demonstrates its ability to address the complexities of medical data. The combination of data augmentation, contextual embedding generation, and advanced classification mechanisms offers a robust and accurate diagnostic tool, with potential applications in automated medical diagnosis and clinical decision support. This method demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed NLP framework for medical diagnosis, achieving remarkable results with an accuracy of 99.78%, recall of 99.72%, precision of 99.79%, and an F1-score of 99.75%. These metrics not only underscore the model's robust performance in classifying medical texts with exceptional precision and reliability but also highlight its superiority over existing methods, making it a highly promising tool for automated diagnostic systems."

      "abstract": "Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/"

      "abstract": "Objectives: Permissible limits have been established by international guidelines and standards for human protection to electromagnetic field exposure to prevent adverse health effects stemming from electrostimulation in the most sensitive body part. That is the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the intermediate frequency range (300 Hz to 100 kHz) and the central nervous system (CNS) at lower frequencies. However, there is a need to reevaluate protection limits against CNS electrostimulation in the intermediate frequency range, considering the importance of brain tissues during electromagnetic head exposure. This study aims to derive the level of CNS cortical stimulation to evaluate compliance with existing protection limits. Method: Multi-scale computation modelling was used to evaluate neuron stimulation thresholds by integrating individual neurons into realistic anatomical head models. Five different excitable membrane models within the motor cortex were examined across three human head models, providing the most comprehensive and extensive evaluation to date. Results: Current protection limits are confirmed as conservative, with non-compliance observed in only 0.02% and 2.4% of axons under clamped and sealed boundary conditions, respectively. The study highlights significant intersubject variability (up to 600% mean threshold) and clarifies the influence of neural excitation models on permissible level assessments. Conclusion: Current electric field limits are conservative for CNS electrostimulation in the intermediate frequencies range, but the margin of safety decreases at higher frequencies, warranting further evaluation. Impact: The findings and methodology contribute to the rationale and provide valuable insights for revising electromagnetic safety exposure guidelines."

However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study adopts a data-driven approach and presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals an unexpected finding: prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures are among the most memorized, with de-identification markers contributing the most. Furthermore, we also find existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens highlighting a broader issue in T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. On this front, we propose actionable strategies to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset."

      "abstract": "In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, the poor quality of unlabeled data and the uncertainty in the model's predictions lead to models that inevitably produce erroneous pseudo-labels. These errors accumulate throughout model training, thereby weakening the model's performance. We found that these erroneous pseudo-labels are typically concentrated in high-uncertainty regions. Traditional methods improve performance by directly discarding pseudo-labels in these regions, but this can also result in neglecting potentially valuable training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional uncertainty-aware region learning strategy. In training labeled data, we focus on high-uncertainty regions, using precise label information to guide the model's learning in potentially uncontrollable areas. Meanwhile, in the training of unlabeled data, we concentrate on low-uncertainty regions to reduce the interference of erroneous pseudo-labels on the model. Through this bidirectional learning strategy, the model's overall performance has significantly improved. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on different medical image segmentation tasks."

However, the spatial and contrast resolution crucially depends on the weights applied in the compound phase, whose optimization is often cumbersome and based on trial and error. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a closed-form approach that maps the transmit apodization weights used in synthetic aperture imaging into the compound mask applied to divergent wave imaging. The approach draws inspiration from a successful technique developed for plane wave imaging, leveraging synthetic aperture imaging as a reference due to its superior image quality. It works for both linear and convex geometries and arbitrary spatial arrangements of virtual sources generating divergent waves. The approach has been validated through simulated data using both linear and convex probes, demonstrating that the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) in Divergent Wave Linear Array (DWLA) increased by 7.5% at 20 mm and 9% at 30 mm compared to Synthetic Aperture Linear Array (SALA). For Divergent Wave Convex Array (DWCA), the increase was 1.64% at 20 mm and 26.56% at 30 mm compared to Synthetic Aperture Convex Array (SACA), witnessing the method's effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.

      "abstract": "Manual segmentation is labor-intensive, and automatic segmentation remains challenging due to the inherent variability in meniscal morphology, partial volume effects, and low contrast between the meniscus and surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose ERANet, an innovative semi-supervised framework for meniscus segmentation that effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled images through advanced augmentation and learning strategies. ERANet integrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype consistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy within a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant perturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations align with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by aligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature representations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST improves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and mitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these innovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus segmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation. We validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and 3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the superior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus structures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST, solidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus segmentation in medical imaging."

      "abstract": "Multi-class cell segmentation in high-resolution gigapixel whole slide images (WSI) is crucial for various clinical applications. However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-agent-based approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively, as they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence agreement regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable agreement regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the AI to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets.

However, how and why people judge different AI use cases to be acceptable or unacceptable remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the attitudes and reasons that influence people's judgments about AI's development via a survey administered to demographically diverse participants (N=197). We focus on ten distinct professional (e.g., Lawyer AI) and personal (e.g., Digital Medical Advice AI) AI use cases to understand how characteristics of the use cases and the participants' demographics affect acceptability. We explore the relationships between participants' judgments and their rationales such as reasoning approaches (cost-benefit reasoning vs. rule-based). Our empirical findings reveal number of factors that influence acceptance such as general negative acceptance and higher disagreement of professional usage over personal, significant influence of demographics factors such as gender, employment, and education as well as AI literacy level, and reasoning patterns such as rule-based reasoning being used more when use case is unacceptable. Based on these findings, we discuss the key implications for soliciting acceptability and reasoning of AI use cases to collaboratively build consensus. Finally, we shed light on how future FAccT researchers and practitioners can better incorporate diverse perspectives from lay people to better develop AI that aligns with public expectations and needs."
