      "abstract": "Accurate fetal brain tissue segmentation and biometric analysis are essential for studying brain development in utero. The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced automated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new task alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse multi-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset. Evaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler characteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods, most of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans. However, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be reaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The ED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional metrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores, highlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with high-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but most methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting reliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis identified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model generalization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial role. Other factors, such as gestational age, pathology, and acquisition site, had smaller, though still measurable, effects. Overall, FeTA 2024 offers a comprehensive benchmark for multi-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI, underscoring the need for data-centric approaches, improved topological evaluation, and greater dataset diversity to enable clinically robust and generalizable AI tools."

      "abstract": "Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes."

This study utilizes mutual information (MI) and pixel intensity distributions to differentiate between normal and tumor-affected brain MRI images. Mutual information analyses revealed significantly higher MI values in tumor images compared to normal ones, indicating greater internal similarity within tumor images. Pixel intensity analysis further demonstrated distinct distribution patterns between the two groups: tumor images showed pronounced pixel frequency concentrations within a specific intensity range (0.3, 0.4), suggesting predictable structural characteristics. Conversely, normal images exhibited broader, more uniform pixel intensity distributions across most intensity ranges, except for an initial peak observed in both groups. These findings highlight the capability of information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information and pixel intensity analysis, to effectively distinguish tumor tissue from normal brain structures, providing promising avenues for enhanced diagnostic and analytical methods in neuroimaging."

      "abstract": "We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature."

      "abstract": "A common factor across electromagnetic methodologies of brain stimulation is the optimization of essential dosimetry parameters, like amplitude, phase, and location of one or more transducers, which controls the stimulation strength and targeting precision. Since obtaining in-vivo measurements for the electric field distribution inside the biological tissue is challenging, physics-based simulators are used. However, these simulators are computationally expensive and time-consuming, making repeated calculations of electric fields for optimization purposes computationally prohibitive. To overcome this issue, we developed EMulator, a U-Net architecture-based regression model, for fast and robust complex electric field estimation. We trained EMulator using electric fields generated by 43 antennas placed around 14 segmented human brain models. Once trained, EMulator uses a segmented human brain model with an antenna location as an input and outputs the corresponding electric field. A representative result of our study is that, at 1.5 GHz, on the validation dataset consisting of 6 subjects, we can estimate the electric field with the magnitude of complex correlation coefficient of 0.978. Additionally, we could calculate the electric field with a mean time of 4.4 ms. On average, this is at least x1200 faster than the time required by state-of-the-art physics-based simulator COMSOL. The significance of this work is that it shows the possibility of real-time calculation of the electric field from the segmented human head model and antenna location, making it possible to optimize the amplitude, phase, and location of several different transducers with stochastic gradient descent since our model is almost everywhere differentiable."

Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging."

To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called \"Deep VQC\" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features."

Noise analyses are central to MRI reconstruction for providing an explicit measure of solution fidelity and for guiding the design and deployment of novel reconstruction methods. However, deep learning (DL)-based reconstruction methods have often overlooked noise propagation due to inherent analytical and computational challenges, despite its critical importance. This work proposes a theoretically grounded, memory-efficient technique to calculate voxel-wise variance for quantifying uncertainty due to acquisition noise in accelerated MRI reconstructions. Our approach approximates noise covariance using the DL network's Jacobian, which is intractable to calculate. To circumvent this, we derive an unbiased estimator for the diagonal of this covariance matrix (voxel-wise variance) and introduce a Jacobian sketching technique to efficiently implement it. We evaluate our method on knee and brain MRI datasets for both data- and physics-driven networks trained in supervised and unsupervised manners. Compared to empirical references obtained via Monte Carlo simulations, our technique achieves near-equivalent performance while reducing computational and memory demands by an order of magnitude or more. Furthermore, our method is robust across varying input noise levels, acceleration factors, and diverse undersampling schemes, highlighting its broad applicability. Our work reintroduces accurate and efficient noise analysis as a central tenet of reconstruction algorithms, holding promise to reshape how we evaluate and deploy DL-based MRI. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance."

This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions."

Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare."

As an applicative use case, we focused on classifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological conditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a simple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and gradually modified to move from a \"black box\" to a more transparent model, without compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined from a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants, including ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG representations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to quantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through training-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168 parameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability, resists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and reduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded EEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between test set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from training data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn band-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for performance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally effective in EEG pathology classification."

After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\\% and 7.3\\%, respectively.

The Huber weighting function reduces the influence of outliers, while the class probability mechanism assigns less weight to noisy data points, resulting in a more resilient model. We explore two distinct approaches for calculating class centers within the R2VFL framework: the simple average of all data points in each class and the median of each feature, the later providing a robust alternative by minimizing the effect of extreme values. These approaches give rise to two novel variants of the model-R2VFL-A and R2VFL-M. We extensively evaluate the proposed models on 47 UCI datasets, encompassing both binary and multiclass datasets, and conduct rigorous statistical testing, which confirms the superiority of the proposed models. Notably, the models also demonstrate exceptional performance in classifying EEG signals, highlighting their practical applicability in real-world biomedical domain."

      "abstract": "Within-frequency coupling (WFC) and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in brain networks reflect neural synchronization within the same frequency band and cross-band oscillatory interactions, respectively. Their synergy provides a comprehensive understanding of neural mechanisms underlying cognitive states such as emotion. However, existing multi-channel EEG studies often analyze WFC or CFC separately, failing to fully leverage their complementary properties. This study proposes a dual-branch graph neural network (DB-GNN) to jointly identify within- and cross-frequency coupled brain networks. Firstly, DBGNN leverages its unique dual-branch learning architecture to efficiently mine global collaborative information and local cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling information. Secondly, to more fully perceive the global information of cross-frequency and within-frequency coupling, the global perception branch of DB-GNN adopts a Transformer architecture. To prevent overfitting of the Transformer architecture, this study integrates prior within- and cross-frequency coupling information into the Transformer inference process, thereby enhancing the generalization capability of DB-GNN. Finally, a multi-scale graph contrastive learning regularization term is introduced to constrain the global and local perception branches of DB-GNN at both graph-level and node-level, enhancing its joint perception ability and further improving its generalization performance. Experimental validation on the emotion recognition dataset shows that DB-GNN achieves a testing accuracy of 97.88% and an F1- score of 97.87%, reaching the state-of-the-art performance."

While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities.

However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems."

To this end, we propose MPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based Classifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2) a clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity.

We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\\% and 7.3\\%, respectively.

By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior.

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%."

Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches."

Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research."

Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to 7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level fMRI analyses.

Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures.

Here, we investigate whether it is possible to predict both task-evoked and spontaneous fMRI signals of motor brain networks from EEG time-varying spectral power using interpretable models trained for individual subjects with Sparse Group Lasso regularization. Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects.

      "abstract": "Electrical potential scalp recordings (Electroencephalograms-EEGs) are a common tool used to investigate brain activity. EEG is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data."

      "abstract": "The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures.\" We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods."

The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\\tau\\to \\mu\\gamma$, $\\tau\\to e\\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$."

We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis.

However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume.

For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

      "abstract": "How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have enabled automated CXR interpretation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, despite their strong visual understanding, current Medical LMMs (MLMMs) still face two major challenges: (1) Insufficient region-level understanding and interaction, and (2) Limited accuracy and interpretability due to single-step reasoning. In this paper, we empower MLMMs with anatomy-centric reasoning capabilities to enhance their interactivity and explainability. Specifically, we first propose an Anatomical Ontology-Guided Reasoning (AOR) framework, which centers on cross-modal region-level information to facilitate multi-step reasoning. Next, under the guidance of expert physicians, we develop AOR-Instruction, a large instruction dataset for MLMMs training. Our experiments demonstrate AOR's superior performance in both VQA and report generation tasks."

Therefore, in this work, we develop a novel unsupervised descriptor learning method that does not rely on keypoint detection. This enables the resulting descriptor network to be agnostic to the keypoint detector used during the registration inference.   To validate this approach, we perform an extensive and comprehensive comparison on the reference public retinal image registration dataset. Additionally, we test our method with multiple keypoint detectors of varied nature, even proposing some novel ones. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers accurate registration, not incurring in any performance loss versus supervised methods. Additionally, it demonstrates accurate performance regardless of the keypoint detector used. Thus, this work represents a notable step towards leveraging unsupervised learning in the medical domain."

      "abstract": "Retinal image registration, particularly for color fundus images, is a challenging yet essential task with diverse clinical applications. Existing registration methods for color fundus images typically rely on keypoints and descriptors for alignment; however, a significant limitation is their reliance on labeled data, which is particularly scarce in the medical domain.   In this work, we present a novel unsupervised registration pipeline that entirely eliminates the need for labeled data. Our approach is based on the principle that locations with distinctive descriptors constitute reliable keypoints. This fully inverts the conventional state-of-the-art approach, conditioning the detector on the descriptor rather than the opposite.   First, we propose an innovative descriptor learning method that operates without keypoint detection or any labels, generating descriptors for arbitrary locations in retinal images. Next, we introduce a novel, label-free keypoint detector network which works by estimating descriptor performance directly from the input image.   We validate our method through a comprehensive evaluation on four hold-out datasets, demonstrating that our unsupervised descriptor outperforms state-of-the-art supervised descriptors and that our unsupervised detector significantly outperforms existing unsupervised detection methods. Finally, our full registration pipeline achieves performance comparable to the leading supervised methods, while not employing any labeled data. Additionally, the label-free nature and design of our method enable direct adaptation to other domains and modalities."

Existing methods face limitations related to segmentation quality, scalability, and the range of applicable imaging modalities. In this paper, we uncover the potential of the internal representations within frozen medical foundation diffusion models as highly efficient zero-shot learners for tumor segmentation by introducing a novel framework named DiffuGTS. DiffuGTS creates anomaly-aware open-vocabulary attention maps based on text prompts to enable generalizable anomaly segmentation without being restricted by a predefined training category list. To further improve and refine anomaly segmentation masks, DiffuGTS leverages the diffusion model, transforming pathological regions into high-quality pseudo-healthy counterparts through latent space inpainting, and applies a novel pixel-level and feature-level residual learning approach, resulting in segmentation masks with significantly enhanced quality and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and seven tumor categories demonstrate the superior performance of our method, surpassing current state-of-the-art models across multiple zero-shot settings.

An important aspect of biological imaging is the characterization of tissue, which often involves resolving complex structural information such as birefringence and diattenuation. These measures require polarization-sensitive sensing which remains largely unaddressed in quantum-imaging techniques with undetected light. However, the bicolor nature and supreme phase sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers make them particularly advantageous for biological sensing. Hence, we theoretically introduce controllable polarizations of the interrogating light in a quantum-imaging setup and show the potential of nonlinear interferometers to simultaneously sense birefringence and diattenuation with undetected light while discussing both the low- and high-gain regime."

      "abstract": "Medical emergency departments are complex systems in which patients must be treated according to priority rules based on the severity of their condition. We develop a model of emergency departments using Petri nets with priorities, described by nonmonotone piecewise linear dynamical systems. The collection of stationary solutions of such systems forms a \"phase diagram\", in which each phase corresponds to a subset of bottleneck resources (like senior doctors, interns, nurses, consultation rooms, etc.). Since the number of phases is generally exponential in the number of resources, developing automated methods is essential to tackle realistic models. We develop a general method to compute congestion diagrams. A key ingredient is a polynomial time algorithm to test whether a given \"policy\" (configuration of bottleneck tasks) is achievable by a choice of resources. This is done by reduction to a feasibility problem for an unusual class of lexicographic polyhedra. Furthermore, we show that each policy uniquely determines the system's throughput. We apply our approach to a case study, analyzing a simplified model of an emergency department from Assistance Publique - H\\^opitaux de Paris."

However, the complexity of medical data leads to confounders that are difficult to observe, so bias between images and questions is inevitable. Such cross-modal bias makes it challenging to infer medically meaningful answers. In this work, we propose a causal inference framework for the MedVQA task, which effectively eliminates the relative confounding effect between the image and the question to ensure the precision of the question-answering (QA) session. We are the first to introduce a novel causal graph structure that represents the interaction between visual and textual elements, explicitly capturing how different questions influence visual features. During optimization, we apply the mutual information to discover spurious correlations and propose a multi-variable resampling front-door adjustment method to eliminate the relative confounding effect, which aims to align features based on their true causal relevance to the question-answering task. In addition, we also introduce a prompt strategy that combines multiple prompt forms to improve the model's ability to understand complex medical data and answer accurately. Extensive experiments on three MedVQA datasets demonstrate that 1) our method significantly improves the accuracy of MedVQA, and 2) our method achieves true causal correlations in the face of complex medical data."

The algorithm employed here retrieves the projected thickness of the sample from a propagation-based phase contrast image using the transport-of-intensity equation. The first Born approximation is then used to isolate the dark-field signal associated with edge scattering, which increases the visibility of microstructure boundaries. PMMA spheres of known sizes were imaged first as an idealised alveolar model. The dark-field signal was then recovered from propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray images of the lungs of small mammals using this method. The retrieved dark-field signal was found to be proportional to both the alveolar size ($R^2 = 0.85$) and the number in projection ($R^2 = 0.69$), and these measurements could be combined to provide an estimate of the total surface area of the alveolar interfaces ($R^2 = 0.78$). This demonstrates the approach's ability to indicate lung health using the dark-field signal retrieved from a single-phase-contrast X-ray image."

However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes."

We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems."
