Methods: A FIRE-based real-time setup segmenting placenta and fetal brain in real-time, performing T2* fitting and analysis and calculation of the centile was implemented. A nn-UNet were trained and tested on 2989 datasets for the fetal brain and a second one trained on 210 datasets for the placenta for automatic segmentation. T2* normal curves were obtained from 106 cases and prospective evaluation was performed on 10 cases between 35 and 39 weeks GA.   Results: Quantitative brain and placental T2* maps and centiles were available in all prospective cases within 30 seconds. The robustness of the method was shown with intra-scan repeats (mean difference 1.04+/-12.39 ms for fetal brain and -3.15+/-8.88 ms for placenta) and direct validation with vendor-processed offline results (mean difference 1.62+/-4.33 ms for fetal brain and 0.16+/-6.19 ms for placenta).   Discussion and Conclusion: Real-time available organ-specific quantitative information enables more personalized MR examinations, selection of the most pertinent sequences and thus the promise of reduced recalls and specific insights into tissue properties. The here enabled placental T2*, demonstrated in multiple recent studies to be a biomarker sensitive to a range of pregnancy complications, and fetal brain T2* will be explored in further studies in pregnancies with pre-eclampsia, growth restriction as a way of enabling future MR-guided fetal interventions."

However, due to the accessibility of MRI scanners and their lengthy acquisition time, multimodal MR images are not commonly available.

Here, we present TUMSyn, a Text-guided Universal MR image Synthesis generalist model, which can flexibly generate brain MR images with demanded imaging metadata from routinely acquired scans guided by text prompts. To ensure TUMSyn's image synthesis precision, versatility, and generalizability, we first construct a brain MR database comprising 31,407 3D images with 7 MRI modalities from 13 centers. We then pre-train an MRI-specific text encoder using contrastive learning to effectively control MR image synthesis based on text prompts. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and physician assessments indicate that TUMSyn can generate clinically meaningful MR images with specified imaging metadata in supervised and zero-shot scenarios. Therefore, TUMSyn can be utilized along with acquired MR scan(s) to facilitate large-scale MRI-based screening and diagnosis of brain diseases.",

Existing methods for decoding characters or words from EEG recordings either rely on continuous external stimulation for high decoding accuracy or depend on direct intention imagination, which suffers from reduced discrimination ability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use."

These processes play significant roles in neurological disorders. The beneficial effects of brain stimulation may also be mediated through intracellular changes. There is a lack of label-free techniques for monitoring activity-dependent intracellular changes. Electromagnetic (EM) waves at frequencies larger than 1x10^6 Hz (1 MHz) were previously used to probe intracellular contents of cells, as cell membrane becomes transparent at this frequency range. EM waves interact with membranes of intracellular organelles, proteins, and water in the MHz-GHz range. In this work, we developed a device for probing the interaction between intracellular contents of active neurons and EM waves. The device used an array of grounded coplanar waveguides (GCPWs) to deliver EM waves to a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid of rat cortical neurons. Neural activity was evoked using optogenetics, with synchronous detection of propagation of EM waves. Broadband measurements were conducted in the MHz-GHz range to track changes in transmission coefficients. Neuronal activity was found to reversibly alter EM wave transmission. Pharmacological suppression of neuronal activity abolished changes in transmission. Time constants of changes in transmission were in the range of seconds to tens of seconds, suggesting the presence of relatively slow, activity-dependent intracellular processes. This study provides the first evidence that EM transmission through neuronal tissue is activity-dependent in MHz-GHz range. Device developed in this work may find future applications in studies of the mechanisms of neurological disorders and the development of new therapies."

The Blind Policy relies on preset sensor information and algorithms, suitable for known and structured environments, but it lacks adaptability in complex or unknown environments. The Perceptive Policy uses visual sensors to obtain detailed environmental information, allowing it to adapt to complex terrains, but its effectiveness is limited under occluded conditions, especially when perception fails. Unlike the Blind Policy, the Perceptive Policy is not as robust under these conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a MBC:Multi-Brain collaborative system that incorporates the concepts of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and introduces collaboration between the Blind Policy and the Perceptive Policy. By applying this multi-policy collaborative model to a quadruped robot, the robot can maintain stable locomotion even when the perceptual system is impaired or observational data is incomplete. Our simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that this system significantly improves the robot's passability and robustness against perception failures in complex environments, validating the effectiveness of multi-policy collaboration in enhancing robotic motion performance."

However, what these phases are, or whether such a hypothesis is at all valid, is still debated. Here, using a cortical dynamics model based on the work of Wilson and Cowan, we provide both analytical and numerical evidence that a phase of long-range order (LRO) in neural activity may be induced simply by memory (time non-locality) without invoking criticality. The cortical dynamics model contains two distinct time scales: a fast time scale that governs the neural dynamics and a slow one that controls the amount of available resources, acting as the system's memory. When the resource timescale is sufficiently long compared to the activity timescale, we observe an LRO phase, which manifests in avalanche size and duration distributions which follow scale-free probability distributions and satisfy finite-size scaling. When the slow and fast time scales are no longer sufficiently distinct, LRO is destroyed. Since this LRO phase spans a wide range of parameters, it is robust against perturbations, a desirable property not shared by critical systems."

Clinical dMRI data is susceptible to various artifacts during acquisition, which can lead to unreliable subsequent analyses. Therefore, dMRI preprocessing is essential for improving image quality, and manual inspection is often required to ensure that the preprocessed data is sufficiently corrected. However, manual inspection requires expertise and is time-consuming, especially with large-scale dMRI datasets. Given these challenges, an automated dMRI artifact detection tool is necessary to increase the productivity and reliability of dMRI data analysis. To this end, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning framework called $\\textbf{U}$nsupervised $\\textbf{d}$MRI $\\textbf{A}$rtifact $\\textbf{D}$etection via $\\textbf{A}$ngular Resolution Enhancement and $\\textbf{C}$ycle Consistency Learning (UdAD-AC). UdAD-AC leverages dMRI angular resolution enhancement and cycle consistency learning to capture the effective representation of artifact-free dMRI data during training, and it identifies data containing artifacts using designed confidence score during inference. To assess the capability of UdAD-AC, several commonly reported dMRI artifacts, including bias field, susceptibility distortion, and corrupted volume, were added to the testing data. Experimental results demonstrate that UdAD-AC achieves the best performance compared to competitive methods in unsupervised dMRI artifact detection."

This review provides an overview to the most notable signal processing strategies currently used for measuring and modeling brain-heart interactions. It discusses their usability and highlights the main challenges that need to be addressed for future methodological developments. Current methodologies have deepened our understanding of the impact of neural disruptions on brain-heart interactions, solidifying it as a biomarker for evaluation of the physiological state of the nervous system and holding immense potential for disease stratification. The vast outlook of these methods becomes apparent specially in neurological and psychiatric disorders. As we tackle new methodological challenges, gaining a more profound understanding of how these interactions operate, we anticipate further insights into the role of peripheral neurons and the environmental input from the rest of the body in shaping brain functioning."

However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals leads to distribution drift over time, causing severe performance degradation when the model is reused. While numerous domain adaptation (DA) approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this issue, their reliance on large amounts of target data for calibration restricts them to offline scenarios, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Evolvable Fast Adaptation (EvoFA), an online adaptive framework tailored for EEG data. EvoFA organically integrates the rapid adaptation of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and the distribution matching of Domain Adaptation (DA) through a two-stage generalization process. During the training phase, a robust base meta-learning model is constructed for strong generalization. In the testing phase, a designed evolvable meta-adaptation module iteratively aligns the marginal distribution of target (testing) data with the evolving source (training) data within a model-agnostic meta-learning framework, enabling the model to learn the evolving trends of testing data relative to training data and improving online testing performance. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoFA achieves significant improvements compared to the basic FSL method and previous online methods. The introduction of EvoFA paves the way for broader adoption of EEG-based emotion recognition in real-world applications. Our code will be released upon publication."

The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing artifact removal techniques by enhancing the EMD method through interpolation of the upper and lower. For conventional artifact removal methods, the EMD technique is commonly employed. However, the challenge lies in accurately interpolating the missing components of the signal while preserving its inherent frequency components. To overcome this limitation, we incorporated machine learning technique, which enables us to carefully handle the interpolation process without directly manipulating the data. The key advantage of our approach lies in the preservation of the natural characteristics of the EEG signal during artifact removal. By utilizing machine learning for interpolation, we ensure that the average component obtained through the EMD method retains the crucial frequency components of the original signal. This preservation is essential for maintaining the integrity and fidelity of the EEG data, allowing for accurate analysis and interpretation. The results obtained from our evaluation serve to validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for further advancements in EEG signal processing and analysis."

The inherent nature of human perception reveals that, when we think, our body can combine language description and build a vivid picture in our brain. Intuitively, generative models should also hold such versatility. In this paper, we introduce BrainDreamer, a novel end-to-end language-guided generative framework that can mimic human reasoning and generate high-quality images from electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals. Our method is superior in its capacity to eliminate the noise introduced by non-invasive EEG data acquisition and meanwhile achieve a more precise mapping between the EEG and image modality, thus leading to significantly better-generated images. Specifically, BrainDreamer consists of two key learning stages: 1) modality alignment and 2) image generation. In the alignment stage, we propose a novel mask-based triple contrastive learning strategy to effectively align EEG, text, and image embeddings to learn a unified representation. In the generation stage, we inject the EEG embeddings into the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model by designing a learnable EEG adapter to generate high-quality reasoning-coherent images. Moreover, BrainDreamer can accept textual descriptions (e.g., color, position, etc.) to achieve controllable image generation. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior arts in terms of generating quality and quantitative performance."

      "abstract": "Recently, multimodal electroencephalogram (EEG) learning has shown great promise in disease detection. At the same time, ensuring privacy in clinical studies has become increasingly crucial due to legal and ethical concerns. One widely adopted scheme for privacy protection is differential privacy (DP) because of its clear interpretation and ease of implementation. Although numerous methods have been proposed under DP, it has not been extensively studied for multimodal EEG data due to the complexities of models and signal data considered there. In this paper, we propose a novel Differentially Private Multimodal Laplacian Dropout (DP-MLD) scheme for multimodal EEG learning. Our approach proposes a novel multimodal representative learning model that processes EEG data by language models as text and other modal data by vision transformers as images, incorporating well-designed cross-attention mechanisms to effectively extract and integrate cross-modal features. To achieve DP, we design a novel adaptive feature-level Laplacian dropout scheme, where randomness allocation and performance are dynamically optimized within given privacy budgets. In the experiment on an open-source multimodal dataset of Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson's Disease (PD), our proposed method demonstrates an approximate 4\\% improvement in classification accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal EEG learning under DP."

However, the complex cognitive processes involved in multimedia learning pose challenges in understanding its neural mechanisms. This study employs network neuroscience to investigate how multimedia design principles influence the underlying neural mechanisms by examining interactions among various brain regions. Two distinct multimedia programs were constructed using identical auditory content but differing visual designs: one adhered to five guidelines for optimizing multimedia instruction, referred to as principal multimedia, while the other intentionally violated these guidelines, referred to as non-principal multimedia. Cortical functional brain networks were then extracted from EEG data to evaluate local and global information processing across the two conditions. Network measurements revealed that principal networks exhibited more efficient local information processing, whereas non-principal networks demonstrated enhanced global information processing and hub formation. Network modularity analysis also indicated two distinct modular organizations, with modules in non-principal networks displaying higher integration and lower segregation than those in principal networks, aligning with initial findings.

      "abstract": "Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important locations or objects and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is a fundamental problem in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. In this study, we show that these irregular dynamics in natural videos can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals to perform selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose an experimental paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. We then train a stimulus-informed decoder to extract EEG signal components that are correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and show that this decoder can be used on unseen data to detect which of both objects is attended. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap between the target and the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG also captures information about unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design in related fields."

In experiments, this is often achieved using stimulus-response paradigms where the motor augmentation can be optimally timed. However, in the everyday world users primarily act at their own volition. We designed a closed-loop system for motor augmentation using an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to cue users' volitional finger tapping. Relying on the readiness potentials, the system autonomously cued the finger movement at the time of the intent to interact via electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The prototype discriminated pre-movement from idle EEG segments with an average F1 score of 0.7. However, we found only weak evidence for a maintained SoA. Still, participants reported a higher level of control when working with the system instead of being passively moved."

Existing methods for decoding characters or words from EEG recordings either rely on continuous external stimulation for high decoding accuracy or depend on direct intention imagination, which suffers from reduced discrimination ability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use."

To make significant progress toward precise source orientation detection and improved signal reconstruction, we introduce the Accelerated Linear Constrained Minimum Variance (ALCMV) beamforming toolbox and the Accelerated Brain Source Orientation Detection (AORI) toolbox. The ALCMV algorithm speeds up EEG source reconstruction by utilizing recursive covariance matrix calculations, while AORI simplifies source orientation detection from three dimensions to one, reducing computational load by 66% compared to conventional methods. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we demonstrate that these algorithms maintain high accuracy, with orientation errors below 0.2% and signal reconstruction accuracy within 2%.

However, most studies struggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks, limiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a novel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by utilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask learning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the spectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture is used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit different generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To address this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously regulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task based on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six benchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent and -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification results show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering promising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.",

In this study, we propose a Denoising Encoder via Contrastive Alignment Network (DECAN) for dry electrode EEG, under the assumption of the EEG representation consistency between wet and dry electrodes during the same task. Specifically, DECAN employs two parameter-sharing deep neural networks to extract task-relevant representations of dry and wet electrode signals, and then integrates a representation-consistent contrastive loss to minimize the distance between representations from the same timestamp and category but different devices. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we construct an emotion dataset consisting of paired dry and wet electrode EEG signals from 16 subjects with 5 emotions, named PaDWEED. Results on PaDWEED show that DECAN achieves an average accuracy increase of 6.94$\\%$ comparing to state-of-the art performance in emotion recognition of dry electrodes. Ablation studies demonstrate a decrease in inter-class aliasing along with noteworthy accuracy enhancements in the delta and beta frequency bands. Moreover, an inter-subject feature alignment can obtain an accuracy improvement of 5.99$\\%$ and 5.14$\\%$ in intra- and inter-dataset scenarios, respectively.

To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method.

Yet popular methods for studying whole-brain functional connectivity often yield results that are difficult to interpret. Factor analysis offers a natural framework in which to study such dependencies, particularly given its emphasis on interpretability. However, multivariate factor models break down when applied to functional and spatiotemporal data, like fMRI. We present a factor model for discretely-observed multidimensional functional data that is well-suited to the study of functional connectivity. Unlike classical factor models which decompose a multivariate observation into a \"common\" term that captures covariance between observed variables and an uncorrelated \"idiosyncratic\" term that captures variance unique to each observed variable, our model decomposes a functional observation into two uncorrelated components: a \"global\" term that captures long-range dependencies and a \"local\" term that captures short-range dependencies. We show that if the global covariance is smooth with finite rank and the local covariance is banded with potentially infinite rank, then this decomposition is identifiable. Under these conditions, recovery of the global covariance amounts to rank-constrained matrix completion, which we exploit to formulate consistent loading estimators. We study these estimators, and their more interpretable post-processed counterparts, through simulations, then use our approach to uncover a rich covariance structure in a collection of resting-state fMRI scans."

Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset.

Recently, this curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets. Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances. Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance, and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI data."

Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer. It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism. A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency. Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification. Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience. This paper provides a solution for analyzing brain networks, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/AngusMonroe/Contrasformer}.",

      "abstract": "Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to visualize brain activation regions by detecting hemodynamic responses associated with increased metabolic demand. While alternative MRI methods have been employed to monitor functional activities, the investigation of in-vivo electrical property changes during brain function remains limited. In this study, we explored the relationship between fMRI signals and electrical conductivity (measured at the Larmor frequency) changes using phase-based electrical properties tomography (EPT). Our results revealed consistent patterns: conductivity changes showed negative correlations, with conductivity decreasing in the functionally active regions whereas B1 phase mapping exhibited positive correlations around activation regions. These observations were consistent across both motor and visual cortex activations. To further substantiate these findings, we conducted electromagnetic radio-frequency simulations that modeled activation states with varying conductivity, which demonstrated trends similar to our in-vivo results for both B1 phase and conductivity. These findings suggest that in-vivo electrical conductivity changes can indeed be measured during brain activity. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving these measurements."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \\( t \\) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \\( t \\) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject."

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions."

This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal."

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties.

Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

In the field of robotic navigation, the most cutting-edge approaches to enhancing robot reliability in the application domain of healthcare facilities and in general pertain to augmenting navigation systems with human-aware properties. To implement this in our work, the Co-operative Human-Aware Navigation planner has been integrated into the ROS-based differential-drive robot MARRtina and exhaustively challenged within various simulated contexts and scenarios (mainly modelling the situations relevant in the medical domain) to draw attention to the integrated system's benefits and identify its drawbacks or instances of poor performance while exploring the scope of system capabilities and creating a full characterization of its applicability. The simulation results are then presented to medical experts, and the enhanced robot acceptability within the domain is validated with them as the robot is further planned for deployment."

      "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized medical and biological imaging, particularly in segmentation tasks. However, segmenting biological cells remains challenging due to the high variability and complexity of cell shapes. Addressing this challenge requires high-quality datasets that accurately represent the diverse morphologies found in biological cells. Existing cell segmentation datasets are often limited by their focus on regular and uniform shapes. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset of Ntera-2 (NT2) cells, a pluripotent carcinoma cell line, exhibiting diverse morphologies across multiple stages of differentiation, capturing the intricate and heterogeneous cellular structures that complicate segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for complex cellular morphology segmentation (MorphoSeg) by incorporating sampling of virtual outliers from low-likelihood regions during training. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that MorphoSeg significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, achieving up to a 7.74% increase in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and a 28.36% reduction in the Hausdorff Distance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our dataset and methodology in advancing cell segmentation capabilities, especially for complex and variable cell morphologies.

Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions."

The use of diverse modalities, including histopathology slides, MRI, and genetic data, offers unprecedented opportunities to improve prognosis prediction and to unveil new treatment pathways. Contrastive learning, widely used for deriving representations from paired data in multimodal tasks, assumes that different views contain the same task-relevant information and leverages only shared information. This assumption becomes restrictive when handling medical data since each modality also harbors specific knowledge relevant to downstream tasks. We introduce DRIM, a new multimodal method for capturing these shared and unique representations, despite data sparsity. More specifically, given a set of modalities, we aim to encode a representation for each one that can be divided into two components: one encapsulating patient-related information common across modalities and the other, encapsulating modality-specific details. This is achieved by increasing the shared information among different patient modalities while minimizing the overlap between shared and unique components within each modality. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on glioma patients survival prediction tasks, while being robust to missing modalities.

      "abstract": "One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings."

      "abstract": "Scintillation describes the conversion of high-energy particles into light in transparent media and finds diverse applications such as high-energy particle detection and industrial and medical imaging. This process operates on multiple timescales, with the final radiative step consisting of spontaneous emission, which can be modeled within the framework of quasi-equilibrium fluctuational electrodynamics. Scintillation can therefore be controlled and enhanced via nanophotonic effects, which has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Such designs have thus far obeyed Lorentz reciprocity, meaning there is a direct equivalence between scintillation emission and absorption by the scintillator. However, scintillators that do not obey Lorentz reciprocity have not been explored, even though they represent a novel platform for probing emission which is both nonequilibrium and nonreciprocal in nature. In this work, we propose to harness nonreciprocity to achieve directional control of scintillation emission, granting an additional degree of control over scintillation. Such directionality of light output is important in improving collection efficiencies along the directions where detectors are located. We present the design of a nonreciprocal scintillator using a one-dimensional magnetophotonic crystal in the Voigt configuration. Our work demonstrates the potential of controlling nonequilibrium emission such as scintillation by breaking reciprocity and expands the space of nanophotonic design for achieving such control."

Therefore RSD plays an important role in improving patient care and minimising surgical theatre costs via efficient scheduling. In endoscopic pituitary surgery, it is uniquely challenging due to variable workflow sequences with a selection of optional steps contributing to high variability in surgery duration. This paper presents PitRSDNet for predicting RSD during pituitary surgery, a spatio-temporal neural network model that learns from historical data focusing on workflow sequences. PitRSDNet integrates workflow knowledge into RSD prediction in two forms: 1) multi-task learning for concurrently predicting step and RSD; and 2) incorporating prior steps as context in temporal learning and inference. PitRSDNet is trained and evaluated on a new endoscopic pituitary surgery dataset with 88 videos to show competitive performance improvements over previous statistical and machine learning methods. The findings also highlight how PitRSDNet improve RSD precision on outlier cases utilising the knowledge of prior steps."

Proton Arc Therapy (PAT) is an alternative to maintain target coverage, potentially improving organ at risk (OAR) sparing, reducing beam delivery time (BDT), and enhancing patient experience. We aim to perform a systematic plan comparison study between IMPT and ELSA-PAT to assess its potential for lung cancer treatment. Material and Methods: 14 Lung ELSA-PAT plans were compared retrospectively with IMPT plans. 4D worst-case minimax robust optimization was performed, including 84 scenarios (3%,3 mm). Dosimetry assessment included target (CTV) and important OARs, on nominal and worst-case scenarios. Most relevant normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP), target coverage robustness against interplay effect and beam delivery time (BDT) were evaluated. Results: CTV D95% and D98% showed no significant difference in comparison. PAT demonstrated better conformality by 66% (p = 0.00012) but delivered a higher heart mean dose (HMD,23%). There was a 2% increase in NTCP 2-year mortality risk with PAT. Total BDT was comparable among techniques. IMPT was more robust than PAT against interplay effect, considering both D1% (1,0 $\\pm$ 0.8 Gy vs 1.1 $\\pm$ 1.4 Gy) and D98% bandwidths (0.9$\\pm$0.9 Gy vs 1.1 $\\pm$ 1.3 Gy). Interpretation: both techniques provide a similar level of dose coverage to the target volume. Although PAT improved dose conformality, higher HMD translated into increased heart toxicity, presumably due to chosen planning methodology and OAR proximity to target. Increased energy layers and spots raised PAT beam delivery time, although it could improve daily treatment workflow."
