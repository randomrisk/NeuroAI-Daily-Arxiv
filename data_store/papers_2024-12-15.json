      "abstract": "Understanding emotional processing in the human brain requires examining the complex interactions between different brain regions. While previous studies have identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic network approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory to investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks during resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to fear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions would be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to fear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to emotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed participants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in positive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the resting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly decreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward instability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing. Additionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during fear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized network and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's remarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how network stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced triads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex mechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in response to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding emotional resilience and neurological disorders."

      "abstract": "We explore the robustness of complex networks against physical damage. We focus on spatially embedded network models and datasets where links are physical objects or physically transfer some quantity, which can be disrupted at any point along its trajectory. To simulate physical damage, we tile the networks with boxes of equal size and sequentially damage them. By introducing an intersection graph to keep track of the links passing through tiles, we systematically analyze the connectivity of the network and explore how the physical layout and the topology of the network jointly affect its percolation threshold. We show that random layouts make networks extremely vulnerable to physical damage, driven by the presence of very elongated links, and that higher-dimensional embeddings further increase their vulnerability. We compare this picture against targeted physical damages, showing that it accelerates network dismantling and yields non-trivial geometric patterns. Finally, we apply our framework to several empirical networks, from airline networks to vascular systems and the brain, showing qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions."

Understanding multiple sclerosis progression and identifying the implicated brain structures is crucial for personalized treatment decisions. Deformation-based morphometry utilizes anatomical magnetic resonance imaging to quantitatively assess volumetric brain changes at the voxel level, providing insight into how each brain region contributes to clinical progression with regards to neurodegeneration. Utilizing such voxel-level data from a relapsing multiple sclerosis clinical trial, we extend a model-agnostic feature importance metric to identify a robust and predictive feature set that corresponds to clinical progression. These features correspond to brain regions that are clinically meaningful in MS disease research, demonstrating their scientific relevance. When used to predict progression using classical survival models and 3D convolutional neural networks, the identified regions led to the best-performing models, demonstrating their prognostic strength. We also find that these features generalize well to other definitions of clinical progression and can compensate for the omission of highly prognostic clinical features, underscoring the predictive power and clinical relevance of deformation-based morphometry as a regional identification tool."

      "abstract": "Studies of the functional role of the primate ventral visual stream have traditionally focused on object categorization, often ignoring -- despite much prior evidence -- its role in estimating \"spatial\" latents such as object position and pose. Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream."

      "abstract": "Image classification serves as the cornerstone of computer vision, traditionally achieved through discriminative models based on deep neural networks. Recent advancements have introduced classification methods derived from generative models, which offer the advantage of zero-shot classification. However, these methods suffer from two main drawbacks: high computational overhead and inferior performance compared to discriminative models. Inspired by the coordinated cognitive processes of rapid-slow pathway interactions in the human brain during visual signal recognition, we propose the Diffusion-Based Discriminative Model Enhancement Framework (DBMEF). This framework seamlessly integrates discriminative and generative models in a training-free manner, leveraging discriminative models for initial predictions and endowing deep neural networks with rethinking capabilities via diffusion models. Consequently, DBMEF can effectively enhance the classification accuracy and generalization capability of discriminative models in a plug-and-play manner. We have conducted extensive experiments across 17 prevalent deep model architectures with different training methods, including both CNN-based models such as ResNet and Transformer-based models like ViT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DBMEF. Specifically, the framework yields a 1.51\\% performance improvement for ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset and 3.02\\% on the ImageNet-A dataset. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel paradigm for image classification, demonstrating stable improvements across different datasets and neural networks."

The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy.

      "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\\% to 54.88\\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios."

Individual observations are assumed to partially belong to different clusters, allowing variation across multiple functional features. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the underlying shapes, as well as the individual time-transformation functions and levels of membership. Motivating this work is data from EEG signals in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our method agrees with the neuroimaging literature, recovering the 1/f pink noise feature distinctly from the peak in the alpha band. Furthermore, the introduction of a regression component in the estimation of time-transformation functions quantifies the effect of age and clinical designation on the location of the peak alpha frequency (PAF)."

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

Due to individual differences and non-stationarity of EEG signals, such BCIs usually require a subject-specific calibration session before each use, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly. Transfer learning (TL) has been proposed to shorten or eliminate this calibration, but existing TL approaches mainly consider offline settings, where all unlabeled EEG trials from the new user are available. Methods: This paper proposes Test-Time Information Maximization Ensemble (T-TIME) to accommodate the most challenging online TL scenario, where unlabeled EEG data from the new user arrive in a stream, and immediate classification is performed. T-TIME initializes multiple classifiers from the aligned source data. When an unlabeled test EEG trial arrives, T-TIME first predicts its labels using ensemble learning, and then updates each classifier by conditional entropy minimization and adaptive marginal distribution regularization. Our code is publicized. Results: Extensive experiments on three public motor imagery based BCI datasets demonstrated that T-TIME outperformed about 20 classical and state-of-the-art TL approaches.

Neural prosthetics utilizing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology exhibit promise for improving motor rehabilitation outcomes.

Recently, a qualitative repository of EEG signals tied to both upper and lower limb execution of motor and motor imagery tasks has been unveiled. Despite this, the productivity of the Machine Learning (ML) Models that were trained on this dataset was alarmingly deficient, and the evaluation framework seemed insufficient. To enhance outcomes, robust feature engineering (signal processing) methodologies are implemented. A collection of time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet-derived features was obtained from 16-channel EEG signals, and the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) approach was employed to identify the four most significant features. For classification K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Na\\\"ive Bayes (NB) models were implemented with these selected features, evaluating their effectiveness through metrics such as testing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. By leveraging SVM with a Gaussian Kernel, a remarkable maximum testing accuracy of 92.50% for motor activities and 95.48% for imagery activities is achieved. These results are notably more dependable and gratifying compared to the previous study, where the peak accuracy was recorded at 74.36%.

      "abstract": "Information retrieval systems have historically relied on explicit query formulation, requiring users to translate their information needs into text. This process is particularly disruptive during reading tasks, where users must interrupt their natural flow to formulate queries. We present DEEPER (Dense Electroencephalography Passage Retrieval), a novel framework that enables direct retrieval of relevant passages from users' neural signals during naturalistic reading without intermediate text translation. Building on dense retrieval architectures, DEEPER employs a dual-encoder approach with specialised components for processing neural data, mapping EEG signals and text passages into a shared semantic space. Through careful architecture design and cross-modal negative sampling strategies, our model learns to align neural patterns with their corresponding textual content. Experimental results on the ZuCo dataset demonstrate that direct brain-to-passage retrieval significantly outperforms current EEG-to-text baselines, achieving a 571% improvement in Precision@1. Our ablation studies reveal that the model successfully learns aligned representations between EEG and text modalities (0.29 cosine similarity), while our hard negative sampling strategy contributes to overall performance increases."

Within-subject and cross-subject online MI classification experiments on three public datasets, with three different classifiers and three different data augmentation approaches, demonstrated that FRDW can significantly increase the information transfer rate in MI decoding.

Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI decoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit triggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to first distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the MI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes a sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based asynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to screen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI classification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by self-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject and cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG datasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the highest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.",

While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive approach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the requirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex algorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world settings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a sliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for real-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional and attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams, reducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data collection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source electroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot over three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical evidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with reduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the practicality and accessibility of BCI technology. This advancement makes BCI applications more feasible for real-world scenarios, particularly in controlling robotic systems."

A synthetic overview of early and more recent linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM, that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed. Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models, the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and user-adaptive neurotechnology."

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

Due to individual differences and non-stationarity of EEG signals, such BCIs usually require a subject-specific calibration session before each use, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly. Transfer learning (TL) has been proposed to shorten or eliminate this calibration, but existing TL approaches mainly consider offline settings, where all unlabeled EEG trials from the new user are available. Methods: This paper proposes Test-Time Information Maximization Ensemble (T-TIME) to accommodate the most challenging online TL scenario, where unlabeled EEG data from the new user arrive in a stream, and immediate classification is performed. T-TIME initializes multiple classifiers from the aligned source data. When an unlabeled test EEG trial arrives, T-TIME first predicts its labels using ensemble learning, and then updates each classifier by conditional entropy minimization and adaptive marginal distribution regularization. Our code is publicized. Results: Extensive experiments on three public motor imagery based BCI datasets demonstrated that T-TIME outperformed about 20 classical and state-of-the-art TL approaches.

Currently, prosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the amputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes. Although prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects' feature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention. Therefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely through visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the determination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To address this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM) method, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of the human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the prosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based Grasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm. This algorithm predicts pre-grasping object utilizing regression prediction and prior spatial segmentation estimation derived from the prosthetic hand's position and trajectory. The experiments were conducted to grasp 8 common daily objects including cup, fork, etc. The experimental results presented a similarity coefficient $R^{2}$ of grasping process of 0.911, a Root Mean Squared Error ($RMSE$) of 2.47\\degree, a success rate of grasping of 95.43$\\%$, and an average duration of grasping process of 3.07$\\pm$0.41 s.

However, the invasive nature of the procedure significantly limits the availability of iEEG datasets in terms of both the number of participants and the duration of recorded sessions. To address this limitation, we propose a single-participant machine learning model optimized for decoding iEEG signals. The model employs 18 key features and operates in two modes: best channel and combined channel. The combined channel mode integrates spatial information from multiple brain regions, leading to superior classification performance. Evaluations across three datasets -- Music Reconstruction, Audio Visual, and AJILE12 -- demonstrate that the combined channel mode consistently outperforms the best channel mode across all classifiers. In the best-performing cases, Random Forest achieved an F1 score of 0.81 +/- 0.05 in the Music Reconstruction dataset and 0.82 +/- 0.10 in the Audio Visual dataset, while XGBoost achieved an F1 score of 0.84 +/- 0.08 in the AJILE12 dataset. Furthermore, the analysis of brain region contributions in the combined channel mode revealed that the model identifies relevant brain regions aligned with physiological expectations for each task and effectively combines data from electrodes in these regions to achieve high performance. These findings highlight the potential of integrating spatial information across brain regions to improve task decoding, offering new avenues for advancing BCI systems and neurotechnological applications."

While previous studies have identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic network approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory to investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks during resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to fear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions would be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to fear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to emotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed participants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in positive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the resting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly decreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward instability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing. Additionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during fear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized network and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's remarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how network stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced triads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex mechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in response to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding emotional resilience and neurological disorders."

      "abstract": "Brain aging involves structural and functional changes and therefore serves as a key biomarker for brain health. Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to improve brain age estimation by leveraging complementary data. However, fMRI data, being noisier than sMRI, complicates multimodal fusion. Traditional fusion methods often introduce more noise than useful information, which can reduce accuracy compared to using sMRI alone. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework for biological brain age estimation, utilizing a sex-aware adversarial variational autoencoder (SA-AVAE). Our framework integrates adversarial and variational learning to effectively disentangle the latent features from both modalities. Specifically, we decompose the latent space into modality-specific codes and shared codes to represent complementary and common information across modalities, respectively. To enhance the disentanglement, we introduce cross-reconstruction and shared-distinct distance ratio loss as regularization terms. Importantly, we incorporate sex information into the learned latent code, enabling the model to capture sex-specific aging patterns for brain age estimation via an integrated regressor module. We evaluate our model using the publicly available OpenBHB dataset, a comprehensive multi-site dataset for brain age estimation. The results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches and shows significant robustness across various age groups, highlighting its potential for real-time clinical applications in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases."

We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the similarities and differences between semantic representations derived from text, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information that differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our psychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call representational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior representations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and socio-moral dimensions.

These observations can be identified through influential diagnosis, which refers to the detection of observations that are unduly influential on diverse facets of statistical inference. To date, methods for identifying observations influencing the choice of a stochastically selected submodel have been underdeveloped, especially in the high-dimensional setting where the number of predictors p exceeds the sample size n. Recently we proposed an improved diagnostic measure to handle this setting. However, its distributional properties and approximations have not yet been explored. To address this shortcoming, the notion of exchangeability is revived, and used to determine the exact finite- and large-sample distributions of our assessment metric. This forms the foundation for the introduction of both parametric and non-parametric approaches for its approximation and the establishment of thresholds for diagnosis. The resulting framework is extended to logistic regression models, followed by a simulation study conducted to assess the performance of various detection procedures. Finally the framework is applied to data from an fMRI study of thermal pain, with the goal of identifying outlying subjects that could distort the formulation of statistical models using functional brain activity in predicting physical pain ratings. Both linear and logistic regression models are used to demonstrate the benefits of detection and compare the performances of different detection procedures. In particular, two additional influential observations are identified, which are not discovered by previous studies."

Currently, diagnostic methods primarily rely on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observation, which may lead to misdiagnoses due to the subjective evaluation and measurement used in these traditional methods. With the advancement in medical imaging, MR imaging-based diagnosis has become an alternative and more objective approach. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid neural Network model for ASD identification, termded ASD-HNet, to hierarchically extract features on the functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. This hierarchical method can better extract brain representations, improve the diagnostic accuracy, and help us better locate brain regions related to ASD. Specifically, features are extracted from three scales: local regions of interest (ROIs) scale, community-clustering scale, and the whole-communities scale. For the ROI scale, graph convolution is used to transfer features between ROIs. At the community cluster scale, functional gradients are introduced, the clustering algorithm K-Means is used to automatically cluster ROIs with similar functional gradients into several communities, and features of ROIs belonging to the same community are extracted to characterize these communities. At global information integration scale, we extract global features from community-scale brain networks to characterize the whole brain networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method using the public dataset of Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), and elucidate the interpretability of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASD-HNet can yield superior performance than compared methods."

The use of a sliding window technique allowed us to assess how functional connectivity varies over time, further elucidating the transient nature of brain connectivity. Additionally, our findings align with previous literature, reinforcing the notion that cognitive states can be effectively identified through short-duration data, specifically within the 30-60 second timeframe. The established relationships between connectivity strength and cognitive processes, particularly during different visual states, underscore the relevance of our approach for future research into brain dynamics. Overall, this study not only enhances our understanding of the interplay between EEG and fMRI signals but also paves the way for further exploration into the neural correlates of cognitive functions and their implications in clinical settings. Future research should focus on refining these methodologies and exploring their applications in various cognitive and clinical contexts."

Denoising is one of the main preprocessing steps in any fMRI analysis pipeline. This process is challenging in preclinical data in comparison to clinical data due to variations in brain geometry, image resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserved algorithm based on a 3D Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a 3D dense U-net based discriminator called, 3D U-WGAN. We apply a 4D data configuration to effectively denoise temporal and spatial information in analyzing preclinical fMRI data. GAN-based denoising methods often utilize a discriminator to identify significant differences between denoised and noise-free images, focusing on global or local features. To refine the fMRI denoising model, our method employs a 3D dense U-Net discriminator to learn both global and local distinctions. To tackle potential over-smoothing, we introduce an adversarial loss and enhance perceptual similarity by measuring feature space distances. Experiments illustrate that 3D U-WGAN significantly improves image quality in resting-state and task preclinical fMRI data, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio without introducing excessive structural changes in existing methods. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to simulated and real data in a fMRI analysis pipeline."

Despite notable advancements in recent years, existing studies in VBU continue to face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose knowledge from prior subjects as they adapt to new ones. Addressing continual learning in this field is, therefore, essential. This paper introduces a novel framework called Continual Learning for Vision-Brain (COBRA) to address continual learning in VBU. Our approach includes three novel modules: a Subject Commonality (SC) module, a Prompt-based Subject Specific (PSS) module, and a transformer-based module for fMRI, denoted as MRIFormer module. The SC module captures shared vision-brain patterns across subjects, preserving this knowledge as the model encounters new subjects, thereby reducing the impact of catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, the PSS module learns unique vision-brain patterns specific to each subject. Finally, the MRIFormer module contains a transformer encoder and decoder that learns the fMRI features for VBU from common and specific patterns. In a continual learning setup, COBRA is trained in new PSS and MRIFormer modules for new subjects, leaving the modules of previous subjects unaffected. As a result, COBRA effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both continual learning and vision-brain reconstruction tasks, surpassing previous methods."

      "abstract": "Working memory plays a crucial role in various aspects of human life. Therefore, it has been an area of interest in different research studies, especially neuroscience. The neuroscientists investigating working memory have primarily emphasized the brain's functional modularity. At the same time, a holistic perspective is still required to investigate the brain as an integrated and unified system. We hypothesized that the brain should shift towards a more stable state during working memory than the resting state. Therefore, based on the Structural Balance Theory (SBT), we aimed to address this process. To achieve this, we examined triadic associations in signed fMRI networks in healthy individuals using the N-back as the working memory task. We demonstrated that the number of balanced triads increased during the working memory task compared to the resting state, while the opposite is true for imbalanced triads. The increase of balanced triads forced the network to a more stable state with a lower balance energy level. The increase of balanced triads was crucially related to changes in anti-synchrony to synchronous activities between the Temporal Cortex, the Prefrontal Cortex, and the Parietal Cortex, which are known to be involved in various aspects of working memory, during the working memory process. We hope these findings pave the way to a better understanding the working memory process."

      "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\\% to 54.88\\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios."

MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments."

      "abstract": "Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential."

      "abstract": "The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \\in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions."

In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3.

Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy."

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

      "abstract": "How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

      "abstract": "Deterministically solving charged particle transport problems at a sufficient spatial and angular resolution is often prohibitively expensive, especially due to their highly forward peaked scattering. We propose a model order reduction approach which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time, making computations feasible at much higher resolutions and reducing the overall run-time and memory footprint.   For this, we use a hybrid dynamical low-rank approach based on a collided-uncollided split, i.e., the transport equation is split through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer, facilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas collided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the dynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much lower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage. The solution further achieves comparable accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC as previous deterministic approaches."

Given its pervasive impact on public health, there is a pressing need for effective diagnostic tools to enable timely intervention. Our study delves into the application of cutting-edge transfer learning models for the early detection of CKD. Leveraging a comprehensive and publicly available dataset, we meticulously evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art models, including EfficientNetV2, InceptionNetV2, MobileNetV2, and the Vision Transformer (ViT) technique. Remarkably, our analysis demonstrates superior accuracy rates, surpassing the 90% threshold with MobileNetV2 and achieving 91.5% accuracy with ViT. Moreover, to enhance predictive capabilities further, we integrate these individual methodologies through ensemble modeling, resulting in our ensemble model exhibiting a remarkable 96% accuracy in the early detection of CKD. This significant advancement holds immense promise for improving clinical outcomes and underscores the critical role of machine learning in addressing complex medical challenges."

The Andreev bound state spectrum features Weyl nodes within a three-dimensional synthetic Brillouin zone defined in the space of these AC fluxes and the SC phase difference. The aim is to determine the location and topological charge of these nodes by probing the Berry curvature on closed surfaces that may enclose them. This is achieved by adiabatically varying the superconducting phase difference and AC fluxes along a path on these surfaces and measuring the associated currents. We define the kinematic curvature as the cross product of a tangent vector along the path and the vector of these currents. In the adiabatic regime, the path-averaged kinematic curvature provides a quantized response equal to the topological charge enclosed by the surface, provided the path uniformly and densely covers it."

There is a need for more efficient methods that can achieve comparable or superior diagnostic performance without the associated resource burden. We investigated the feasibility of replacing conventional training procedures with an embedding-based approach that leverages concise and semantically meaningful representations of medical images. Using pre-trained foundational models-specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) like ResNet and multimodal models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-we generated image embeddings for multi-class classification tasks. Simple linear classifiers were then applied to these embeddings. The approach was evaluated across diverse medical imaging modalities, including retinal images, mammography, dermatoscopic images, and chest radiographs. Performance was compared to benchmark models trained and tested using traditional methods. The embedding-based models surpassed the benchmark area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) scores by up to 87 percentage in multi-class classification tasks across the various medical imaging modalities. Notably, CLIP embedding models achieved the highest AUC-ROC scores, demonstrating superior classification performance while significantly reducing computational demands. Our study indicates that leveraging embeddings from pre-trained foundational models can effectively replace conventional, resource-intensive training and testing procedures in medical image analysis. This embedding-based approach offers a more efficient alternative for image segmentation, classification, and prediction, potentially accelerating AI technology integration into clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Medical image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions is an ill-posed problem that involves inversion of the imaging operator linking measurement and image domains. In recent years, physics-driven (PD) models have gained prominence in learning-based reconstruction given their enhanced balance between efficiency and performance. For reconstruction, PD models cascade data-consistency modules that enforce fidelity to acquired data based on the imaging operator, with network modules that process feature maps to alleviate image artifacts due to undersampling. Success in artifact suppression inevitably depends on the ability of the network modules to tease apart artifacts from underlying tissue structures, both of which can manifest contextual relations over broad spatial scales. Convolutional modules that excel at capturing local correlations are relatively insensitive to non-local context. While transformers promise elevated sensitivity to non-local context, practical implementations often suffer from a suboptimal trade-off between local and non-local sensitivity due to intrinsic model complexity. Here, we introduce a novel physics-driven autoregressive state space model (MambaRoll) for enhanced fidelity in medical image reconstruction. In each cascade of an unrolled architecture, MambaRoll employs an autoregressive framework based on physics-driven state space modules (PSSM), where PSSMs efficiently aggregate contextual features at a given spatial scale while maintaining fidelity to acquired data, and autoregressive prediction of next-scale feature maps from earlier spatial scales enhance capture of multi-scale contextual features. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions indicate that MambaRoll outperforms state-of-the-art PD methods based on convolutional, transformer and conventional SSM modules."

To overcome this limitation, we focus on the cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) task, aiming to develop a generalized model capable of adapting to a broader range of medical image segmentation scenarios with limited labeled data from the novel target domain. Inspired by the characteristics of frequency domain similarity across different domains, we propose a Frequency-aware Matching Network (FAMNet), which includes two key components: a Frequency-aware Matching (FAM) module and a Multi-Spectral Fusion (MSF) module. The FAM module tackles two problems during the meta-learning phase: 1) intra-domain variance caused by the inherent support-query bias, due to the different appearances of organs and lesions, and 2) inter-domain variance caused by different medical imaging techniques. Additionally, we design an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by the FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the model's segmentation performance. Combining these two modules, our FAMNet surpasses existing FSMIS models and Cross-domain Few-shot Semantic Segmentation models on three cross-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the CD-FSMIS task."

However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric.

However, most existing NIC methods for volumetric medical images focus solely on improving human-oriented perception. For these methods, data need to be decoded back to pixels for downstream machine learning analytics, which is a process that lowers the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment in modern digital healthcare scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Versatile Volumetric Medical Image Coding (VVMIC) framework for both human and machine vision, enabling various analytics of coded representations directly without decoding them into pixels. Considering the specific three-dimensional structure distinguished from natural frame images, a Versatile Volumetric Autoencoder (VVAE) module is crafted to learn the inter-slice latent representations to enhance the expressiveness of the current-slice latent representations, and to produce intermediate decoding features for downstream reconstruction and segmentation tasks. To further improve coding performance, a multi-dimensional context model is assembled by aggregating the inter-slice latent context with the spatial-channel context and the hierarchical hypercontext. Experimental results show that our VVMIC framework maintains high-quality image reconstruction for human vision while achieving accurate segmentation results for machine-vision tasks compared to a number of reported traditional and neural methods."

Indeed, previous work interested in integrating rotation-equivariance into U-Net architecture have focused on solving specific applications with a limited scope. In contrast, this paper aims to provide a more exhaustive evaluation of rotation equivariant U-Net for image segmentation across a broader range of tasks. We benchmark their effectiveness against standard U-Net architectures, assessing improvements in terms of performance and sustainability (i.e., computational cost). Our evaluation focuses on datasets whose orientation of objects of interest is arbitrary in the image (e.g., Kvasir-SEG), but also on more standard segmentation datasets (such as COCO-Stuff) as to explore the wider applicability of rotation equivariance beyond tasks undoubtedly concerned by rotation equivariance. The main contribution of this work is to provide insights into the trade-offs and advantages of integrating rotation equivariance for segmentation tasks."
