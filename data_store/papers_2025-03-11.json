      "abstract": "Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor segmentation and diagnosis by leveraging complementary information from different contrasts. Each contrast highlights specific tumor characteristics, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tumor morphology, edema, and pathological heterogeneity. However, existing methods still face the challenges of multi-level specificity perception across different contrasts, especially with limited annotations. These challenges include data heterogeneity, granularity differences, and interference from redundant information. To address these limitations, we propose a Task-oriented Uncertainty Collaborative Learning (TUCL) framework for multi-contrast MRI segmentation. TUCL introduces a task-oriented prompt attention (TPA) module with intra-prompt and cross-prompt attention mechanisms to dynamically model feature interactions across contrasts and tasks. Additionally, a cyclic process is designed to map the predictions back to the prompt to ensure that the prompts are effectively utilized. In the decoding stage, the TUCL framework proposes a dual-path uncertainty refinement (DUR) strategy which ensures robust segmentation by refining predictions iteratively. Extensive experimental results on limited labeled data demonstrate that TUCL significantly improves segmentation accuracy (88.2\\% in Dice and 10.853 mm in HD95). It shows that TUCL has the potential to extract multi-contrast information and reduce the reliance on extensive annotations.

      "abstract": "Infant-directed speech (IDS) is highly rhythmic, and in European languages IDS is dominated by patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) at ~2Hz (reflecting prosody) and ~5Hz (reflecting individual syllables). The rhythm structure of spoken Japanese is thought to differ from European stress-timed and syllable-timed languages, depending on moraic units. Morae comprise any onset phoneme and vowel phonemes within a syllable, PA-N-DA. Arguably, initial speech encoding via cortical tracking by infants is likely to utilize language-universal physical acoustic structures in speech rather than language-specific structures like morae, since the infant brain must be prepared to acquire any human language. Here a language-blind computational model of linguistic rhythm based on features of the amplitude envelope is used to compute these physical acoustic stimulus characteristics for Japanese. Using ~18,000 samples of natural IDS and child-directed speech (CDS) recorded longitudinally from 6 parents while speaking to their children over the ages 0-5 years, we find that the temporal modulation patterns that characterise the amplitude envelope of Japanese are highly similar to those found for stress-timed and syllable-timed European languages. However, the AM band corresponding to the syllabic level in CDS/IDS in European languages (~2-12Hz, theta-rate cortical tracking) was elongated in Japanese (2.5-17Hz). Further, the phase synchronization ratios between the two slowest AM bands were as likely to be 1:3 as 1:2, which differs from European languages where 1:2 ratios are dominant. Accordingly, the language-universal amplitude-driven physical acoustic structures important for cortical speech tracking flexibly accommodate language-specific differences in core rhythmic units."

While traditional feed-forward machine learning neural networks have enormous potential to encode information, modern architectures provide little insight into the brain's mechanisms. In this work, a Jansen and Rit neural mass model was constructed to encode different sets of inputs, aiming to understand how simple neural circuits can represent information. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize parameters that maximized the differences in responses to particular inputs. These differences in responses manifested as phase-shifted oscillations across the set of inputs. By delivering impulses of excitation synchronized with a particular phase-shifted oscillation, we demonstrated that the encoded phase could be decoded by measuring oscillatory power. These findings demonstrate the capability of neural dynamical circuits to encode and decode information through phase."

GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers, linked through skip connections to preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. By mapping different realizations of a system - generated from the same underlying parameters - into a continuous, structured latent space, GAUDI disentangles invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate its power across multiple applications, including modeling small-world networks, characterizing protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analyzing collective motion in the Vicsek model, and capturing age-related changes in brain connectivity. This approach not only improves the analysis of complex graphs but also provides new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains."

To address these limitations, we propose to learn Riemannian latent representations of such geometric data. To do so, we estimate the pullback metric induced by a Wrapped Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, which explicitly accounts for the data geometry. This enables us to define geometry-aware notions of distance and shortest paths in the latent space, while ensuring that our model only assigns probability mass to the data manifold. This generalizes previous work and allows us to handle complex tasks in various domains, including robot motion synthesis and analysis of brain connectomes."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects millions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans."

      "abstract": "Medical imaging datasets often vary due to differences in acquisition protocols, patient demographics, and imaging devices. These variations in data distribution, known as domain shift, present a significant challenge in adapting imaging analysis models for practical healthcare applications.   Most current domain adaptation (DA) approaches aim either to align the distributions between the source and target domains or to learn an invariant feature space that generalizes well across all domains. However, both strategies require access to a sufficient number of examples, though not necessarily annotated, from the test domain during training. This limitation hinders the widespread deployment of models in clinical settings, where target domain data may only be accessible in real time.   In this work, we introduce HyDA, a novel hypernetwork framework that leverages domain characteristics rather than suppressing them, enabling dynamic adaptation at inference time. Specifically, HyDA learns implicit domain representations and uses them to adjust model parameters on-the-fly, effectively interpolating to unseen domains. We validate HyDA on two clinically relevant applications - MRI brain age prediction and chest X-ray pathology classification - demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks and modalities.

      "abstract": "Unsupervised registration strategies bypass requirements in ground truth transforms or segmentations by optimising similarity metrics between fixed and moved volumes. Among these methods, a recent subclass of approaches based on unsupervised keypoint detection stand out as very promising for interpretability. Specifically, these methods train a network to predict feature maps for fixed and moving images, from which explainable centres of mass are computed to obtain point clouds, that are then aligned in closed-form. However, the features returned by the network often yield spatially diffuse patterns that are hard to interpret, thus undermining the purpose of keypoint-based registration. Here, we propose a three-fold loss to regularise the spatial distribution of the features. First, we use the KL divergence to model features as point spread functions that we interpret as probabilistic keypoints. Then, we sharpen the spatial distributions of these features to increase the precision of the detected landmarks. Finally, we introduce a new repulsive loss across keypoints to encourage spatial diversity. Overall, our loss considerably improves the interpretability of the features, which now correspond to precise and anatomically meaningful landmarks. We demonstrate our three-fold loss in foetal rigid motion tracking and brain MRI affine registration tasks, where it not only outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised strategies, but also bridges the gap with state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks."

However, coherence captures only linear spectral associations, and thus can produce misleading findings when ignoring variations of connectivity in the tails of the distribution. This limitation becomes important when investigating extreme neural events that are characterized by large signal amplitudes. The focus of this paper is to examine connectivity in the tails of the distribution, as this reveals salient information that may be overlooked by standard methods. We develop a novel notion of spectral tail association of periodograms to study connectivity in the network of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of seizure-prone neonates. We further develop a novel non-stationary extremal dependence model for multivariate time series that captures differences in extremal dependence during different brain phases, namely burst-suppression and non-burst-suppression. One advantage of our proposed approach is its ability to identify tail connectivity at key frequency bands that could be associated with outbursts of energy which may lead to seizures. We discuss these novel scientific findings alongside a comparison of the extremal behavior of brain signals for epileptic and non-epileptic patients."

In this paper, we propose SincAlignNet, a novel network based on an improved SincNet and contrastive learning, designed to align audio and EEG features for auditory attention detection. The SincNet component simulates the brain's processing of audio during auditory attention, while contrastive learning guides the model to learn the relationship between EEG signals and attended speech. During inference, we calculate the cosine similarity between EEG and audio features and also explore direct inference of the attended speaker using EEG data. Cross-trial evaluations results demonstrate that SincAlignNet outperforms state-of-the-art AAD methods on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU, achieving average accuracies of 78.3% and 92.2%, respectively, with a 1-second decision window. The model exhibits strong interpretability, revealing that the left and right temporal lobes are more active during both male and female speaker scenarios. Furthermore, we found that using data from only six electrodes near the temporal lobes maintains similar or even better performance compared to using 64 electrodes.

      "abstract": "A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms."

Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation.

Non-invasive BCIs, especially those using electroencephalography (EEG), are practical and safe for various applications. However, their performance is often hindered by EEG non-stationarities, caused by changing mental states or device characteristics like electrode impedance. This challenge has spurred research into adaptive BCIs that can handle such variations. In recent years, interest has grown in using error-related potentials (ErrPs) to enhance BCI performance. ErrPs, neural responses to errors, can be detected non-invasively and have been integrated into different BCI paradigms to improve performance through error correction or adaptation.   This research introduces a novel adaptive ErrP-based BCI approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the feasibility of an RL-driven adaptive framework incorporating ErrPs and motor imagery. Utilizing two RL agents, the framework adapts dynamically to EEG non-stationarities. Validation was conducted using a publicly available motor imagery dataset and a fast-paced game designed to boost user engagement. Results show the framework's promise, with RL agents learning control policies from user interactions and achieving robust performance across datasets. However, a critical insight from the game-based protocol revealed that motor imagery in a high-speed interaction paradigm was largely ineffective for participants, highlighting task design limitations in real-time BCI applications. These findings underscore the potential of RL for adaptive BCIs while pointing out practical constraints related to task complexity and user responsiveness."

However, their quadratic computational complexity presents challenges in memory efficiency, training, and inference speed, limiting their scalability and generalizability as a foundation model. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework based on structured state space duality (SSD) that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 introduces three key innovations: (1) a reconstruction-based framework that captures both local and global EEG features through Mamba-2 structured state space models, (2) a spatiotemporal-aware loss function that enhances robustness to noise and preserves spectral information, and (3) a multi-branch receptive field input embedding strategy that improves cross-subject generalization and stability for EEG sequences of varying lengths. In comparison to traditional pretraining methods, on raw EEG or latent representation spaces, EEGM2 shows superior performance on long-sequence tasks, where conventional models struggle. Our experimental results on six EEG datasets validate that EEGM2 not only achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it a more efficient solution for deployment on resource-constrained BCI devices.",

The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments."

This paper proposed a biofocal masking attention-based method (SSVEP-BiMA) that synergistically leverages the native and symmetric-antisymmetric components for decoding SSVEP. By utilizing multiple signal representations, the network is able to integrate features from a wider range of sample perspectives, leading to more generalized and comprehensive feature learning, which enhances both prediction accuracy and robustness. We performed experiments on two public datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses baseline approaches in both accuracy and ITR.

However, the small size of annotated fMRI datasets restricts its wide application. Meanwhile, structural MRIs (sMRIs), such as 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, which are commonly used and readily accessible in clinical settings, are often overlooked. To integrate the complementary information from both function and structure for improved diagnostic accuracy, we propose CINP (Contrastive Image-Network Pre-training), a framework that employs contrastive learning between sMRI and FCN. During pre-training, we incorporate masked image modeling and network-image matching to enhance visual representation learning and modality alignment. Since the CINP facilitates knowledge transfer from FCN to sMRI, we introduce network prompting. It utilizes only sMRI from suspected patients and a small amount of FCNs from different patient classes for diagnosing mental disorders, which is practical in real-world clinical scenario. The competitive performance on three mental disorder diagnosis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CINP in integrating multimodal MRI information, as well as the potential of incorporating sMRI into clinical diagnosis using network prompting."

Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease."

Region-of-interest analysis revealed that amplifying drum and bass components in K-pop songs significantly increased activity in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior/superior parietal lobules, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that low-frequency grooves engage sensorimotor, executive, and rhythm semantics networks, reinforcing their role in action-related processing.

Conventional experiment-driven approaches hinge on manually constructed visual stimulus collections and corresponding brain activity recordings, constraining the support and coverage of concept localization. Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural contexts and are potentially biased by subjective preferences, thus prompting concerns about the validity and generalizability of the identified regions. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven exploration approach. By synthesizing extensive brain activity recordings, we statistically localize various concept-selective regions. Our proposed MindSimulator leverages advanced generative technologies to learn the probability distribution of brain activity conditioned on concept-oriented visual stimuli. This enables the creation of simulated brain recordings that reflect real neural response patterns. Using the synthetic recordings, we successfully localize several well-studied concept-selective regions and validate them against empirical findings, achieving promising prediction accuracy. The feasibility opens avenues for exploring novel concept-selective regions and provides prior hypotheses for future neuroscience research."

However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$.

Many existing machine learning models struggle to provide comprehensive interpretability, often failing to extract meaningful biomarkers from imaging data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or lacking mechanisms to explain the significance of non-imaging data. In this paper, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a novel framework designed to learn from fine-grained local patterns to comprehensive global multi-modal interactions. This framework comprises two key modules.

In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions.

Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution."

      "abstract": "Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments."

Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks.

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

      "abstract": "Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy through medical image analysis for pneumonia diagnosis. However, traditional multimodal approaches often fail to address real-world challenges such as incomplete data and modality loss. In this study, a Flexible Multimodal Transformer (FMT) was proposed, which uses ResNet-50 and BERT for joint representation learning, followed by a dynamic masked attention strategy that simulates clinical modality loss to improve robustness; finally, a sequential mixture of experts (MOE) architecture was used to achieve multi-level decision refinement. After evaluation on a small multimodal pneumonia dataset, FMT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 93% F1 score, outperforming single-modal baselines (ResNet: 89%; BERT: 79%) and the medical benchmark CheXMed (90%), providing a scalable solution for multimodal diagnosis of pneumonia in resource-constrained medical settings."

      "abstract": "Image segmentation is a challenging task influenced by multiple sources of uncertainty, such as the data labeling process or the sampling of training data. In this paper we focus on binary segmentation and address these challenges using conformal prediction, a family of model- and data-agnostic methods for uncertainty quantification that provide finite-sample theoretical guarantees and applicable to any pretrained predictor. Our approach involves computing nonconformity scores, a type of prediction residual, on held-out calibration data not used during training. We use dilation, one of the fundamental operations in mathematical morphology, to construct a margin added to the borders of predicted segmentation masks. At inference, the predicted set formed by the mask and its margin contains the ground-truth mask with high probability, at a confidence level specified by the user. The size of the margin serves as an indicator of predictive uncertainty for a given model and dataset. We work in a regime of minimal information as we do not require any feedback from the predictor: only the predicted masks are needed for computing the prediction sets. Hence, our method is applicable to any segmentation model, including those based on deep learning; we evaluate our approach on several medical imaging applications."

      "abstract": "Cardiac ultrasound (US) scanning is a commonly used techniques in cardiology to diagnose the health of the heart and its proper functioning. Therefore, it is necessary to consider ways to automate these tasks and assist medical professionals in classifying and assessing cardiac US images. Machine learning (ML) techniques are regarded as a prominent solution due to their success in numerous applications aimed at enhancing the medical field, including addressing the shortage of echography technicians. However, the limited availability of medical data presents a significant barrier to applying ML in cardiology, particularly regarding US images of the heart. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing the first open graded dataset for Cardiac Assessment and ClassificaTion of UltraSound (CACTUS), which is available online. This dataset contains images obtained from scanning a CAE Blue Phantom and representing various heart views and different quality levels, exceeding the conventional cardiac views typically found in the literature. Additionally, the paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL) framework consisting of two main components. The first component classifies cardiac US images based on the heart view using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The second component uses Transfer Learning (TL) to fine-tune the knowledge from the first component and create a model for grading and assessing cardiac images. The framework demonstrates high performance in both classification and grading, achieving up to 99.43% accuracy and as low as 0.3067 error, respectively. To showcase its robustness, the framework is further fine-tuned using new images representing additional cardiac views and compared to several other state-of-the-art architectures. The framework's outcomes and performance in handling real-time scans were also assessed using a questionnaire answered by cardiac experts."

      "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is crucial in extensive practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, medical EEG analysis, and action recognition. Real-world time series datasets typically exhibit complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, RNN-based, CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid models have been proposed. Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks."

Robotic Ultrasound Systems (RUSS) aim to address these limitations by providing standardized and automated imaging solutions, especially in environments with limited access to skilled operators. This paper presents the development of a novel RUSS system that employs dual RGB-D depth cameras to maintain the US probe normal to the skin surface, a critical factor for optimal image quality. Our RUSS integrates RGB-D camera data with robotic control algorithms to maintain orthogonal probe alignment on uneven surfaces without preoperative data. Validation tests using a phantom model demonstrate that the system achieves robust normal positioning accuracy while delivering ultrasound images comparable to those obtained through manual scanning. A-SEE2.0 demonstrates 2.47 ${\\pm}$ 1.25 degrees error for flat surface normal-positioning and 12.19 ${\\pm}$ 5.81 degrees normal estimation error on mannequin surface. This work highlights the potential of A-SEE2.0 to be used in clinical practice by testing its performance during in-vivo forearm ultrasound examinations."

      "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has revolutionized open-set interactive image segmentation, inspiring numerous adapters for the medical domain. However, SAM primarily relies on sparse prompts such as point or bounding box, which may be suboptimal for fine-grained instance segmentation, particularly in endoscopic imagery, where precise localization is critical and existing prompts struggle to capture object boundaries effectively. To address this, we introduce S4M (Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points), which augments SAM by leveraging extreme points -- the top-, bottom-, left-, and right-most points of an instance -- prompts. These points are intuitive to identify and provide a faster, structured alternative to box prompts. However, a na\\\"ive use of extreme points degrades performance, due to SAM's inability to interpret their semantic roles. To resolve this, we introduce dedicated learnable embeddings, enabling the model to distinguish extreme points from generic free-form points and better reason about their spatial relationships. We further propose an auxiliary training task through the Canvas module, which operates solely on prompts -- without vision input -- to predict a coarse instance mask. This encourages the model to internalize the relationship between extreme points and mask distributions, leading to more robust segmentation. S4M outperforms other SAM-based approaches on three endoscopic surgical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex scenarios. Finally, we validate our approach through a human annotation study on surgical endoscopic videos, confirming that extreme points are faster to acquire than bounding boxes."

In this work, we revisit MeshNet, a parameter-efficient segmentation model, and introduce a novel multi-scale dilation pattern with an encoder-decoder structure. This innovation enables capturing broad contextual information and fine-grained details without traditional downsampling, upsampling, or skip-connections. Unlike previous approaches processing subvolumes or slices, we operate directly on whole-brain $256^3$ MRI volumes. Evaluations on the Aphasia Recovery Cohort (ARC) dataset demonstrate that MeshNet achieves superior or comparable DICE scores to state-of-the-art architectures such as MedNeXt and U-MAMBA at 1/1000th of parameters. Our results validate MeshNet's strong balance of efficiency and performance, making it particularly suitable for resource-limited environments such as web-based applications and opening new possibilities for the widespread deployment of advanced medical image analysis tools."

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world question-answering (QA) applications. However, LLMs have been proven to generate hallucinations and nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical tasks. Conformal prediction (CP) is well-known to be model-agnostic and distribution-free, which creates statistically rigorous prediction sets in classification tasks. In this work, we for the first time adapt the CP framework to medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks, by correlating the nonconformity score with the frequency score of correct options grounded in self-consistency theory, assuming no access to internal model information. Considering that the adapted CP framework can only control the (mis)coverage rate, we employ a risk control framework, which can manage task-specific metrics by devising a monotonically decreasing loss function. We evaluate our framework on 3 popular medical MCQA datasets utilizing 4 ``off-the-shelf'' LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that we achieve user-specified average (or marginal) error rates on the test set. Furthermore, we observe that the average prediction set size (APSS) on the test set decreases as the risk level increases, which concludes a promising evaluation metric for the uncertainty of LLMs."

      "abstract": "Deep learning models achieve high predictive performance but lack intrinsic interpretability, hindering our understanding of the learned prediction behavior. Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide more general global explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to analyze network training dynamics, investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models."
