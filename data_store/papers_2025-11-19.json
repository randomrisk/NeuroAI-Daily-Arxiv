      "abstract": "Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.",

While commercial perfusion analysis software exists, it is often costly, closed source, and lacks customizability. This work introduces PyPeT, an openly available Python Perfusion Tool for head CTP and MRP processing. PyPeT is capable of producing cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time-to-peak (TTP), and time-to-maximum (Tmax) maps from raw four-dimensional perfusion data. PyPeT aims to make perfusion research as accessible and customizable as possible. This is achieved through a unified framework in which both CTP and MRP data can be processed, with a strong focus on modularity, low computational burden, and significant inline documentation. PyPeT's outputs can be validated through an extensive debug mode in which every step of the process is visualized. Additional validation was performed via visual and quantitative comparison with reference perfusion maps generated by three FDA-approved commercial perfusion tools and a research tool. These comparisons show a mean SSIM around 0.8 for all comparisons, indicating a good and stable correlation with FDA-approved tools.

In contrast, global methods, which attempt to optimize a collection of streamlines to maximize compatibility with underlying fiber orientation estimates, are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce GenTract, the first generative model for global tractography. We frame tractography as a generative task, learning a direct mapping from dMRI to complete, anatomically plausible streamlines. We compare both diffusion-based and flow matching paradigms and evaluate GenTract's performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, GenTract achieves precision 2.1x higher than the next-best method, TractOracle. This advantage becomes even more pronounced in challenging low-resolution and noisy settings, where it outperforms the closest competitor by an order of magnitude. By producing tractograms with high precision on research-grade data while also maintaining reliability on imperfect, lower-resolution data, GenTract represents a promising solution for global tractography.",

Direct training of SNNs typically relies on surrogate gradient (SG) learning to estimate derivatives of non-differentiable spiking activity. However, during training, the distribution of neuronal membrane potentials varies across timesteps and progressively deviates toward both sides of the firing threshold. When the firing threshold and SG remain fixed, this may lead to imbalanced spike firing and diminished gradient signals, preventing SNNs from performing well. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stage synergistic learning algorithm that achieves forward adaptive thresholding and backward dynamic SG. In forward propagation, we adaptively adjust thresholds based on the distribution of membrane potential dynamics (MPD) at each timestep, which enriches neuronal diversity and effectively balances firing rates across timesteps and layers. In backward propagation, drawing from the underlying association between MPD, threshold, and SG, we dynamically optimize SG to enhance gradient estimation through spatio-temporal alignment, effectively mitigating gradient information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, it allows neurons to fire stable proportions of spikes at each timestep and increases the proportion of neurons that obtain gradients in deeper layers.",

However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space.

The test statistic measures variance reduction when comparing within group to between group dispersions in the Wasserstein space.

Current UAD methods typically utilize artificially generated noise perturbations on healthy MRIs to train generative models for normal anatomy reconstruction, enabling anomaly detection via residual mapping. However, such simulated anomalies lack the biophysical fidelity and morphological complexity characteristic of true clinical lesions. To advance UAD in brain MRI, we conduct the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of pathological signatures, revealing two key properties: (1) anomalies exhibit unique frequency patterns distinguishable from normal anatomy, and (2) low-frequency signals maintain consistent representations across healthy scans. These insights motivate our Frequency-Decomposition Preprocessing (FDP) framework, the first UAD method to leverage frequency-domain reconstruction for simultaneous pathology suppression and anatomical preservation. FDP can integrate seamlessly with existing anomaly simulation techniques, consistently enhancing detection performance across diverse architectures while maintaining diagnostic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FDP consistently improves anomaly detection performance when integrated with existing methods. Notably, FDP achieves a 17.63% increase in DICE score with LDM while maintaining robust improvements across multiple baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ls1rius/MRI_FDP.",

As tumors expand, they induce substantial anatomical deformation that disrupts both local tissue organization and global brain architecture, complicating diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. Yet a subject-specific reference of how the brain would appear without tumor-induced changes is fundamentally unobtainable in clinical practice. We present BrainNormalizer, an anatomy-informed diffusion framework that reconstructs pseudo-healthy MRIs directly from tumorous scans by conditioning the generative process on boundary cues extracted from the subject's own anatomy. This boundary-guided conditioning enables anatomically plausible pseudo-healthy reconstruction without requiring paired non-tumorous and tumorous scans. BrainNormalizer employs a two-stage training strategy. The pretrained diffusion model is first adapted through inpainting-based fine-tuning on tumorous and non-tumorous scans. Next, an edge-map-guided ControlNet branch is trained to inject fine-grained anatomical contours into the frozen decoder while preserving learned priors. During inference, a deliberate misalignment strategy pairs tumorous inputs with non-tumorous prompts and mirrored contralateral edge maps, leveraging hemispheric correspondence to guide reconstruction. On the BraTS2020 dataset, BrainNormalizer achieves strong quantitative performance and qualitatively produces anatomically plausible reconstructions in tumor-affected regions while retaining overall structural coherence. BrainNormalizer provides clinically reliable anatomical references for treatment planning and supports new research directions in counterfactual modeling and tumor-induced deformation analysis.",

This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

These multi-spectral topography maps are then fed to a separate encoder to obtain the representations in frequency domain. Our solution employs a multi-domain attention module that maps these domain-specific embeddings onto a shared embedding space to emphasize more on important inter-domain relationships to enhance the representations for cognitive load classification. Additionally, we incorporate an orthogonal projection constraint during the training of our method to effectively increase the inter-class distances while improving intra-class clustering. This enhancement allows efficient discrimination between different cognitive states and aids in better grouping of similar states within the feature space. We validate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on two public EEG datasets, CL-Drive and CLARE for cognitive load classification.

Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity.

In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech.

Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.",

A key component in scaling these models is population-level representation learning, which leverages information across channels to capture spatial as well as temporal structure. Population-level approaches have recently shown that such representations can be both efficient to learn on top of pretrained temporal encoders and produce useful representations for decoding a variety of downstream tasks. However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space.

In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component.

We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.",

EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation.

Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control.

Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines. These findings highlight that leveraging brain-derived state information--even without additional user labels--can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs.",

This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

To address the significant computational challenges of GP inference in high-dimensional neuroimaging data, we employ a low-rank kernel approximation that enables projection into a reduced-dimensional subspace. This allows for efficient posterior computation without sacrificing spatial resolution, and we have developed efficient algorithms for this implemented in Python that achieve fully Bayesian inference either within minutes using the Gibbs sampler or within seconds using mean-field variational inference (VI). Through extensive simulation studies, we first show that SIMBA outperforms competing methods in estimation accuracy, activation detection sensitivity, and uncertainty quantification, especially in low signal-to-noise settings.

We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives.

We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

      "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases. However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use. Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1) significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84\\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\\% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55\\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\\%).

However, existing mod els largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations, treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations. To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations for diagnostic prediction.

Such flavor structures are known as two-zero textures. Processes with charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), absent in the Standard Model (SM), can have sizable rates in this framework and are directly linked to the flavor structure of $M^\u03bd$. For each allowed two-zero texture, we quantify the predicted correlations among various CLFV observables using current neutrino oscillation data and show that they lead to distinctive patterns of CLFV processes that could be discriminated between at running and upcoming experiments. In addition, together with information from colliders, the sensitivity of these correlations to renormalization group (RG) effects could shed light on the potentially ultra-high scale where new dynamics (e.g. some underlying flavor symmetry) give rise to the two-zero texture. Furthermore, we find that certain zero textures, although not third-generation specific, can suppress $\u03bc\\to e$ transitions while allowing the rate of the process $\u03c4\\to \\bar\u03bcee$ to be within the future experimental sensitivity, even when the RG evolution is taken into account. The lowest possible cut-off scale of the effective theory, constructed by treating the two-zero flavor structure of $M^\u03bd$ as a CLFV spurion, can therefore reach $5-6$ TeV. Our results provide further motivation for searches for $\u03c4$ CLFV at Belle II, as probes of new physics complementary to MEG II and the upcoming Mu3e, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, as well as for collider searches for doubly charged scalar bosons.",

Existing approaches primarily align neural activity directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context, peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked example using openly available EEG data.

That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

We model the molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate non-rotating components of the molecular gas -- the most likely contributor to future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and within the central kiloparsec. Our results indicate that the probability of occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.",

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.",

While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.",

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains.

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

      "abstract": "Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.",

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

      "abstract": "Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.",

In addition to its 30~MW pool-type reactor, the RMB complex will include additional facilities for radioisotope production and related applications. $^{161}Tb$ is a promising radionuclide for radiopharmaceutical therapy, offering decay properties similar to $^{177}Lu$ but with additional conversion and Auger electrons that enhance dose delivery to cancer cells. In light of this emerging radioisotope, this study explores the potential production of $^{161}Tb$ in the RMB through neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets. Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulations provided detailed neutron flux distributions, which were used as input for ORIGEN calculations of isotope buildup. Assuming 10 mg targets enriched to 97.5% in $^{160}Gd$, a 40-day irradiation, and a thermal flux of $2 \\cdot 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$, the results indicate that $^{161}Tb$ activity reaches approximately 4.5 GBq after 14 days ($\\approx 450 GBq/g$), in agreement with data from other research reactors. Building on prior studies that demonstrated the RMB's capability to irradiate larger targets, terabecquerel-scale yields appear feasible. These findings highlight the RMB's potential to support domestic production of emerging therapeutic radionuclides such as $^{161}Tb$. The potential for isotopic enrichment of $^{160}Gd$ using the AVLIS method is also discussed.",

To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.",

They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.",

However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability.

We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.",

PyPeT's outputs can be validated through an extensive debug mode in which every step of the process is visualized. Additional validation was performed via visual and quantitative comparison with reference perfusion maps generated by three FDA-approved commercial perfusion tools and a research tool. These comparisons show a mean SSIM around 0.8 for all comparisons, indicating a good and stable correlation with FDA-approved tools.
