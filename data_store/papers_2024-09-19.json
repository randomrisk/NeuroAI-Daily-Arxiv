      "abstract": "An unprecedented amount of existing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data provides a new opportunity to understand the relationship between functional fluctuation and human cognition/behavior using a data-driven approach. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made in machine learning to predict cognitive states from evolving volumetric images of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Due to the complex nature of brain function, however, the evaluation on learning performance and discoveries are not often consistent across current state-of-the-arts (SOTA). By capitalizing on large-scale existing neuroimaging data (34,887 data samples from six public databases), we seek to establish a well-founded empirical guideline for designing deep models for functional neuroimages by linking the methodology underpinning with knowledge from the neuroscience domain. Specifically, we put the spotlight on (1) What is the current SOTA performance in cognitive task recognition and disease diagnosis using fMRI? (2) What are the limitations of current deep models? and (3) What is the general guideline for selecting the suitable machine learning backbone for new neuroimaging applications? We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation and statistical analysis, in various settings, to answer the above outstanding questions."

      "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D visuals from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, introduced as Recon3DMind in our conference work, is of significant interest to both cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. To advance this task, we present the fMRI-3D dataset, which includes data from 15 participants and showcases a total of 4768 3D objects. The dataset comprises two components: fMRI-Shape, previously introduced and accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Shape, and fMRI-Objaverse, proposed in this paper and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Objaverse. fMRI-Objaverse includes data from 5 subjects, 4 of whom are also part of the Core set in fMRI-Shape, with each subject viewing 3142 3D objects across 117 categories, all accompanied by text captions. This significantly enhances the diversity and potential applications of the dataset. Additionally, we propose MinD-3D, a novel framework designed to decode 3D visual information from fMRI signals. The framework first extracts and aggregates features from fMRI data using a neuro-fusion encoder, then employs a feature-bridge diffusion model to generate visual features, and finally reconstructs the 3D object using a generative transformer decoder. We establish new benchmarks by designing metrics at both semantic and structural levels to evaluate model performance. Furthermore, we assess our model's effectiveness in an Out-of-Distribution setting and analyze the attribution of the extracted features and the visual ROIs in fMRI signals. Our experiments demonstrate that MinD-3D not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic and spatial accuracy but also deepens our understanding of how human brain processes 3D visual information.

      "abstract": "Studying influential nodes (I-nodes) in brain networks is of great significance in the field of brain imaging. Most existing studies consider brain connectivity hubs as I-nodes. However, this approach relies heavily on prior knowledge from graph theory, which may overlook the intrinsic characteristics of the brain network, especially when its architecture is not fully understood. In contrast, self-supervised deep learning can learn meaningful representations directly from the data. This approach enables the exploration of I-nodes for brain networks, which is also lacking in current studies. This paper proposes a Self-Supervised Graph Reconstruction framework based on Graph-Transformer (SSGR-GT) to identify I-nodes, which has three main characteristics. First, as a self-supervised model, SSGR-GT extracts the importance of brain nodes to the reconstruction. Second, SSGR-GT uses Graph-Transformer, which is well-suited for extracting features from brain graphs, combining both local and global characteristics. Third, multimodal analysis of I-nodes uses graph-based fusion technology, combining functional and structural brain information. The I-nodes we obtained are distributed in critical areas such as the superior frontal lobe, lateral parietal lobe, and lateral occipital lobe, with a total of 56 identified across different experiments. These I-nodes are involved in more brain networks than other regions, have longer fiber connections, and occupy more central positions in structural connectivity. They also exhibit strong connectivity and high node efficiency in both functional and structural networks. Furthermore, there is a significant overlap between the I-nodes and both the structural and functional rich-club. These findings enhance our understanding of the I-nodes within the brain network, and provide new insights for future research in further understanding the brain working mechanisms."

Current deep learning methods often struggle to balance accuracy with computational demands. We propose Lite-FBCN, a novel Lightweight Fast Bilinear Convolutional Network designed to address this issue. Unlike traditional dual-network bilinear models, Lite-FBCN utilizes a single-network architecture, significantly reducing computational load. Lite-FBCN leverages lightweight, pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned to extract relevant features and incorporates a channel reducer layer before bilinear pooling, minimizing feature map dimensionality and resulting in a compact bilinear vector. Extensive evaluations on cross-validation and hold-out data demonstrate that Lite-FBCN not only surpasses baseline CNNs but also outperforms existing bilinear models. Lite-FBCN with MobileNetV1 attains 98.10% accuracy in cross-validation and 69.37% on hold-out data (a 3% improvement over the baseline). UMAP visualizations further confirm its effectiveness in distinguishing closely related brain disease classes. Moreover, its optimal trade-off between performance and computational efficiency positions Lite-FBCN as a promising solution for enhancing diagnostic capabilities in resource-constrained and or real-time clinical environments.",

      "abstract": "Understanding neurological disorder is a fundamental problem in neuroscience, which often requires the analysis of brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to brain networks faces challenges. Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer. It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism. A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency. Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification. Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\\\"odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms."

Utilizing the Fredholm alternative, we extend the well-posedness results to the discrete setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging."

In particular, we attempted to answer the following questions: How does the higher-order topology of the brain network change from the pre-ictal to the ictal phase, from the ictal to the post-ictal phase, at each frequency band and in each cerebral hemisphere?

Physiological signals, being beyond voluntary control, offer reliable information for this purpose, unlike speech and facial expressions which can be controlled at will. They reflect genuine emotional responses, devoid of conscious manipulation, thereby enhancing the credibility of emotion recognition systems. Nonetheless, multimodal emotion recognition with deep learning models remains a relatively unexplored field. In this paper, we introduce a fully hypercomplex network with a hierarchical learning structure to fully capture correlations. Specifically, at the encoder level, the model learns intra-modal relations among the different channels of each input signal. Then, a hypercomplex fusion module learns inter-modal relations among the embeddings of the different modalities. The main novelty is in exploiting intra-modal relations by endowing the encoders with parameterized hypercomplex convolutions (PHCs) that thanks to hypercomplex algebra can capture inter-channel interactions within single modalities. Instead, the fusion module comprises parameterized hypercomplex multiplications (PHMs) that can model inter-modal correlations. The proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art models on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset for emotion recognition, specifically in classifying valence and arousal from electroencephalograms (EEGs) and peripheral physiological signals.

Classification models need periodic adaptation for real-life use, making an optimal re-training strategy essential to maximize user acceptance and maintain high performance. We propose TOR, a train-on-request workflow that enables user-specific model adaptation to novel conditions, addressing signal variability over time. Using continual learning, TOR preserves knowledge across sessions and mitigates inter-session variability. With TOR, users can refine, on demand, the model through on-device learning (ODL) to enhance accuracy adapting to changing conditions. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a motor-movement dataset recorded with a non-stigmatizing wearable BMI headband, achieving up to 92% accuracy and a re-calibration time as low as 1.6 minutes, a 46% reduction compared to a naive transfer learning workflow. We additionally demonstrate that TOR is suitable for ODL in extreme edge settings by deploying the training procedure on a RISC-V ultra-low-power SoC (GAP9), resulting in 21.6 ms of latency and 1 mJ of energy consumption per training step. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an online, energy-efficient, dynamic adaptation of a BMI model to the intrinsic variability of EEG signals in real-time settings."

Ear-EEG has recently gained significant attention due to its motion tolerance and invisibility during data acquisition, making it easy to incorporate with other devices for applications. In this work, participants selectively attended to one of the four spatially separated speakers' speech in an anechoic room. The EEG data were concurrently collected from a scalp-EEG system and an ear-EEG system (cEEGrids). Temporal response functions (TRFs) and stimulus reconstruction (SR) were utilized using ear-EEG data. Results showed that the attended speech TRFs were stronger than each unattended speech and decoding accuracy was 41.3\\% in the 60s (chance level of 25\\%).

Existing studies often rely on domain-specific time-frequency features and analyze temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics separately, neglecting the interaction between local-global relationships and spatiotemporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a novel network called Multi-Scale Inverted Mamba (MS-iMamba), which consists of Multi-Scale Temporal Blocks (MSTB) and Temporal-Spatial Fusion Blocks (TSFB). Specifically, MSTBs are designed to capture both local details and global temporal dependencies across different scale subsequences. The TSFBs, implemented with an inverted Mamba structure, focus on the interaction between dynamic temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics. The primary advantage of MS-iMamba lies in its ability to leverage reconstructed multi-scale EEG sequences, exploiting the interaction between temporal and spatial features without the need for domain-specific time-frequency feature extraction. Experimental results on the DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED datasets demonstrate that MS-iMamba achieves classification accuracies of 94.86%, 94.94%, and 91.36%, respectively, using only four-channel EEG signals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

However, most studies struggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks, limiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a novel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by utilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask learning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the spectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture is used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit different generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To address this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously regulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task based on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six benchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent and -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification results show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering promising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.",

In this study, we propose a Denoising Encoder via Contrastive Alignment Network (DECAN) for dry electrode EEG, under the assumption of the EEG representation consistency between wet and dry electrodes during the same task. Specifically, DECAN employs two parameter-sharing deep neural networks to extract task-relevant representations of dry and wet electrode signals, and then integrates a representation-consistent contrastive loss to minimize the distance between representations from the same timestamp and category but different devices. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we construct an emotion dataset consisting of paired dry and wet electrode EEG signals from 16 subjects with 5 emotions, named PaDWEED. Results on PaDWEED show that DECAN achieves an average accuracy increase of 6.94$\\%$ comparing to state-of-the art performance in emotion recognition of dry electrodes. Ablation studies demonstrate a decrease in inter-class aliasing along with noteworthy accuracy enhancements in the delta and beta frequency bands. Moreover, an inter-subject feature alignment can obtain an accuracy improvement of 5.99$\\%$ and 5.14$\\%$ in intra- and inter-dataset scenarios, respectively.

To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method.

However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm."

In this study, we explored the relationship between fMRI signals and electrical conductivity (measured at the Larmor frequency) changes using phase-based electrical properties tomography (EPT). Our results revealed consistent patterns: conductivity changes showed negative correlations, with conductivity decreasing in the functionally active regions whereas B1 phase mapping exhibited positive correlations around activation regions. These observations were consistent across both motor and visual cortex activations. To further substantiate these findings, we conducted electromagnetic radio-frequency simulations that modeled activation states with varying conductivity, which demonstrated trends similar to our in-vivo results for both B1 phase and conductivity. These findings suggest that in-vivo electrical conductivity changes can indeed be measured during brain activity. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving these measurements."

We perform a cross-decomposition analysis of fMRI responses to natural images in multiple individuals from the Natural Scenes Dataset and find that neural representations systematically exhibit a power-law covariance spectrum over four orders of magnitude in ranks. This scale-free structure is found in multiple regions along the visual hierarchy, pointing to the existence of a generic encoding strategy in visual cortex. We also show that, up to a rotation, a large ensemble of principal axes of these population codes are shared across subjects, showing the existence of a universal high-dimensional representation. This suggests a high level of convergence in how the human brain learns to represent natural scenes despite individual differences in neuroanatomy and experience. We further demonstrate that a spectral approach is critical for characterizing population codes in their full extent, and in doing so, we reveal a vast space of uncharted dimensions that have been out of reach for conventional variance-weighted methods. A global view of neural representations thus requires embracing their high-dimensional nature and understanding them statistically rather than through visual or semantic interpretation of individual dimensions."

Given a structural model in the form of a directed graph, the method extracts the set of all constraints of conditional independence induced by the absence of links between pairs of regions in the model and tests for their validity in a Bayesian framework, either individually (constraint by constraint), jointly (e.g., by gathering all constraints associated with a given missing link), or globally (i.e., all constraints associated with the structural model). This approach has two main advantages. First, it only tests what is testable from observational data and does allow for false causal interpretation. Second, it makes it possible to test each constraint (or group of constraints) separately and, therefore, quantify in what measure each constraint (or, e..g., missing link) is respected in the data. We validate our approach using a simulation study and illustrate its potential benefits through the reanalysis of published data."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. By decomposing rs-fMRI signals using DWT, our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Graph theory provides a robust mathematical framework to analyze these complex networks, while machine learning is employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function."

Our model integrates three components: an edge-based learning module that encodes functional connectivity between brain regions, a lesion encoding module, and a subgraph learning module that leverages functional similarities for prediction. We use synthetic data derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for hyperparameter tuning and model pretraining. We then evaluate the performance using repeated 10-fold cross-validation on an in-house neuroimaging dataset of post-stroke aphasia. Our results demonstrate that LEGNet outperforms baseline deep learning methods in predicting language ability. LEGNet also exhibits superior generalization ability when tested on a second in-house dataset that was acquired under a slightly different neuroimaging protocol. Taken together, the results of this study highlight the potential of LEGNet in effectively learning the relationships between rs-fMRI connectivity and language ability in a patient cohort with brain lesions for improved post-stroke aphasia evaluation."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.

We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

A common approach is to assume that the control group can be characterised in terms of standard Normal statistics and the detection of single abnormal subject is in that context. But in many situations the control group can not be described in terms of Normal statistics and the use of standard statistics is inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-Subject Test (BIGPAST), designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of control group comes from the skewed Student's \\( t \\) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through a series of simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy. This is because BIGPAST can effectively reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student's \\( t \\) assumption. We apply BIGPAST to a MEG dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in the single-subject."

A novel MEG model is proposed for deploying GAI models on edge servers (ES) and user equipment~(UE) to jointly complete text-to-image generation tasks. In the generation task, the ES and UE will cooperatively generate the image according to the text prompt given by the user. To enable the MEG, a pre-trained latent diffusion model (LDM) is invoked to generate the latent feature, and an edge-inferencing MEG protocol is employed for data transmission exchange between the ES and the UE. A compression coding technique is proposed for compressing the latent features to produce seeds. Based on the above seed-enabled MEG model, an image quality optimization problem with transmit power constraint is formulated. The transmitting power of the seed is dynamically optimized by a deep reinforcement learning agent over the fading channel. The proposed MEG enabled text-to-image generation system is evaluated in terms of image quality and transmission overhead. The numerical results indicate that, compared to the conventional centralized generation-and-downloading scheme, the symbol number of the transmission of MEG is materially reduced. In addition, the proposed compression coding approach can improve the quality of generated images under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions."

Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal."

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns. Nonetheless, the development of a robust deep-learning model for retinal disease diagnosis necessitates a substantial dataset for training. The capacity to generalize effectively on smaller datasets remains a persistent challenge. The scarcity of data presents a significant barrier to the practical implementation of scalable medical AI solutions. To address this issue, we've combined a wide range of data sources to improve performance and generalization to new data by giving it a deeper understanding of the data representation from multi-modal datasets and developed a self-supervised framework based on large language models (LLMs), SwinV2 to gain a deeper understanding of multi-modal dataset representations, enhancing the model's ability to extrapolate to new data for the detection of eye diseases using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We adopt a two-phase training methodology, self-supervised pre-training, and fine-tuning on a downstream supervised classifier. An ablation study conducted across three datasets employing various encoder backbones, without data fusion, with low data availability setting, and without self-supervised pre-training scenarios, highlights the robustness of our method. Our findings demonstrate consistent performance across these diverse conditions, showcasing superior generalization capabilities compared to the baseline model, ResNet-50."

      "abstract": "When employing deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic segmentation in safety-critical applications like automotive perception or medical imaging, it is important to estimate their performance at runtime, e.g. via uncertainty estimates or prediction quality estimates. Previous works mostly performed uncertainty estimation on pixel-level. In a line of research, a connected-component-wise (segment-wise) perspective was taken, approaching uncertainty estimation on an object-level by performing so-called meta classification and regression to estimate uncertainty and prediction quality, respectively. In those works, each predicted segment is considered individually to estimate its uncertainty or prediction quality. However, the neighboring segments may provide additional hints on whether a given predicted segment is of high quality, which we study in the present work. On the basis of uncertainty indicating metrics on segment-level, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the relationship of a given segment's quality as a function of the given segment's metrics as well as those of its neighboring segments. We compare different GNN architectures and achieve a notable performance improvement."

However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, the most commonly used architectures for this task, struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs and the computational complexity of Transformers. To address this limitation, we introduce TTT-Unet, a novel framework that integrates Test-Time Training (TTT) layers into the traditional U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. TTT-Unet dynamically adjusts model parameters during the testing time, enhancing the model's ability to capture both local and long-range features. We evaluate TTT-Unet on multiple medical imaging datasets, including 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results demonstrate that TTT-Unet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation models across all tasks.

      "abstract": "X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) provides higher sensitivity to contrast between low absorbing objects that can be invisible to conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging. XPCI's main application has been so far focused on medical areas at relatively low energies (< 100 keV). The translation to higher energy for industrial applications, where energies above 150 keV are often needed, is hindered by the lack of masks/gratings with sufficiently thick gold septa. Fabricating such structures with apertures of tens of micrometers becomes difficult at depths greater than a few hundreds of micrometers due to aspect ratio dependent effects such as anisotropic etching, and preferential gold (Au) deposition at the top of the apertures. In this work, these difficulties are overcome by Deep Reactive Ion Etching optimized by a stepped parameters approach and bismuth-mediated superconformal filling of Au, ultimately resulting in 500 micrometers deep silicon masks filled with Au at bulk density. The obtained masks, tested in an Edge Illumination XPCI system with a conventional source and a photon-counting detector, show good agreement with simulations at different energy thresholds. They also demonstrate a higher phase sensitivity for highly absorbing objects when compared to lower aspect ratio masks, proving their potential for industrial non-destructive testing."

This requires specialized analysis by obstetrics professionals, in a task that i) is highly time- and cost-consuming and ii) often yields inconsistent results. The utility of automatic segmentation algorithms for biometry has been proven, though existing results remain suboptimal. To push forward advancements in this area, the Grand Challenge on Pubic Symphysis-Fetal Head Segmentation (PSFHS) was held alongside the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2023). This challenge aimed to enhance the development of automatic segmentation algorithms at an international scale, providing the largest dataset to date with 5,101 intrapartum ultrasound images collected from two ultrasound machines across three hospitals from two institutions. The scientific community's enthusiastic participation led to the selection of the top 8 out of 179 entries from 193 registrants in the initial phase to proceed to the competition's second stage. These algorithms have elevated the state-of-the-art in automatic PSFHS from intrapartum ultrasound images. A thorough analysis of the results pinpointed ongoing challenges in the field and outlined recommendations for future work. The top solutions and the complete dataset remain publicly available, fostering further advancements in automatic segmentation and biometry for intrapartum ultrasound imaging."

While this strategy is often implemented by setting data after the intercurrent event to missing even if they have been collected, g-estimation allows for a more efficient estimation by using the information contained in post-IE data. As the g-estimation methods have largely developed outside of randomised clinical trials, optimisations for the application in clinical trials are possible. In this work, we describe and investigate the performance of modifications to the established g-estimation methods, leveraging the assumption that some intercurrent events are expected to have the same impact on the outcome regardless of the timing of their occurrence. In a simulation study in Alzheimer disease, the modifications show a substantial efficiency advantage for the estimation of an estimand that applies the hypothetical strategy to the use of symptomatic treatment while retaining unbiasedness and adequate type I error control."

The prevailing development of quantum computing and machine learning (ML) technologies may bring practical improvement to the performance of CHD diagnosis. Quantum machine learning (QML) is receiving tremendous interest in various disciplines due to its higher performance and capabilities. A quantum leap in the healthcare industry will increase processing power and optimise multiple models. Techniques for QML have the potential to forecast cardiac disease and help in early detection. To predict the risk of coronary heart disease, a hybrid approach utilizing an ensemble machine learning model based on QML classifiers is presented in this paper. Our approach, with its unique ability to address multidimensional healthcare data, reassures the method's robustness by fusing quantum and classical ML algorithms in a multi-step inferential framework. The marked rise in heart disease and death rates impacts worldwide human health and the global economy. Reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality requires early detection of heart disease. In this research, a hybrid approach utilizes techniques with quantum computing capabilities to tackle complex problems that are not amenable to conventional machine learning algorithms and to minimize computational expenses. The proposed method has been developed in the Raspberry Pi 5 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform and tested on a broad dataset that integrates clinical and imaging data from patients suffering from CHD and healthy controls. Compared to classical machine learning models, the accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of the proposed hybrid QML model used with CHD are manifold higher."

We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs' supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability.
