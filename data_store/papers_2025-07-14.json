      "abstract": "Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods."

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature, however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities, overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency, achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of vascular contributions to brain health."

      "abstract": "The coordinated activity of neural populations underlies myriad brain functions. Manipulating this activity using brain stimulation techniques has great potential for scientific and clinical applications, as it provides a tool to causally influence brain function. The state of the brain affects how neural populations respond to incoming sensory stimuli. Thus, taking into account pre-stimulation neural population activity may be crucial to achieve a desired causal manipulation using stimulation. In this work, we propose Online MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a brain stimulation framework that leverages brain state information to find stimulation parameters that can drive neural population activity toward specified states. OMiSO includes two key advances: i) it leverages the pre-stimulation brain state to choose optimal stimulation parameters, and ii) it adaptively refines the choice of those parameters by considering newly-observed stimulation responses. We tested OMiSO by applying intracortical electrical microstimulation in a monkey and found that it outperformed competing methods that do not incorporate these advances. Taken together, OMiSO provides greater accuracy in achieving specified activity states, thereby advancing neuromodulation technologies for understanding the brain and for treating brain disorders."

      "abstract": "Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation."

      "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors have become an aggressive and dangerous disease that leads to death worldwide.Multi-modal MRI data is crucial for accurate brain tumor segmentation, but missing modalities common in clinical practice can severely degrade the segmentation performance. While incomplete multi-modal learning methods attempt to address this, learning robust and discriminative features from arbitrary missing modalities remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Semantic-guided Masked Mutual Learning (SMML) approach to distill robust and discriminative knowledge across diverse missing modality scenarios.Specifically, we propose a novel dual-branch masked mutual learning scheme guided by Hierarchical Consistency Constraints (HCC) to ensure multi-level consistency, thereby enhancing mutual learning in incomplete multi-modal scenarios. The HCC framework comprises a pixel-level constraint that selects and exchanges reliable knowledge to guide the mutual learning process. Additionally, it includes a feature-level constraint that uncovers robust inter-sample and inter-class relational knowledge within the latent feature space. To further enhance multi-modal learning from missing modality data, we integrate a refinement network into each student branch. This network leverages semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide supplementary information, effectively complementing the masked mutual learning strategy in capturing auxiliary discriminative knowledge. Extensive experiments on three challenging brain tumor segmentation datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art methods in diverse missing modality settings."

At this scale, the synchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key mechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy brains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human connectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the higher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase oscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter for a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the multiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they are connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this range of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral graph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of nodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small mutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant clusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them. With the parallel analysis of the weighted core network and its binary version, we demonstrate the primary role of the network's topology in the formation of synchronised clusters. Meanwhile, the wights of edges contribute to the hub's synchronisation with the surrounding cluster, stabilise the order parameter variations and reduce the multifractal spectrum."

Although existing technologies have made progress in reconstructing the mel spectrograms of auditory stimuli at the word or letter level, there remain core challenges in the precise reconstruction of minute-level continuous imagined speech: traditional models struggle to balance the efficiency of temporal dependency modeling and information retention in long-sequence decoding. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network (DMF2Mel), which consists of four core components: the Dynamic Contrastive Feature Aggregation Module (DC-FAM), the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Network (HAMS-Net), the SplineMap attention mechanism, and the bidirectional state space module (convMamba). Specifically, the DC-FAM separates speech-related \"foreground features\" from noisy \"background features\" through local convolution and global attention mechanisms, effectively suppressing interference and enhancing the representation of transient signals. HAMS-Net, based on the U-Net framework,achieves cross-scale fusion of high-level semantics and low-level details. The SplineMap attention mechanism integrates the Adaptive Gated Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AGKAN) to combine global context modeling with spline-based local fitting. The convMamba captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity and enhances nonlinear dynamic modeling capabilities. Results on the SparrKULee dataset show that DMF2Mel achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.074 in mel spectrogram reconstruction for known subjects (a 48% improvement over the baseline) and 0.048 for unknown subjects (a 35% improvement over the baseline).Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DMF2Mel."

A good Machine Learning classifier should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).   We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous."

Portable low-field (< 0.1 T) MRI is increasingly used for point-of-care imaging, but electromagnetic interference (EMI) presents a significant challenge, especially in unshielded environments. EMI can degrade image quality and compromise diagnostic utility. This study investigates whether subject grounding can effectively reduce EMI and improve image quality, comparing different grounding strategies. Methods. Experiments were conducted using a 47 mT Halbach-based MRI scanner with a single receive channel. Reproducibility was evaluated at a second site using a 72 mT scanner with similar geometry. Turbo spin echo sequences were used to image the hand and brain. Subject grounding was implemented using conductive cloth sleeves or ECG electrodes, each connected between the subject's skin and scanner ground. Three EMI conditions were tested: ambient, added single-frequency EMI, and broadband EMI. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were calculated under each configuration. Results. Subject grounding significantly reduced EMI in both hand and brain scans. In hand imaging, conductive sleeves reduced noise from 85x to 1.25x the 50-ohm noise floor. In brain imaging, grounding alone reduced noise from 55x to 25x baseline; when combined with arc RF shields, noise was further reduced to 1.2x baseline, even under added EMI. These results were reproducible across different scanners and locations. Conclusion. Subject grounding is a simple, effective, and reproducible strategy for mitigating EMI in portable low-field MRI. It is especially effective for hand imaging, while brain imaging benefits from additional RF shielding. The approach is robust under various EMI conditions and may complement other denoising techniques."

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important, low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models."

EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However, EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific) factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15 participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax. Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their outcomes."

      "abstract": "Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile, such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes - is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques - time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception, maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception."

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

This paper aims to fully recover the structure of an undirected graphical model when the data naturally take matrix form, such as temporal multivariate data.   As conventional vector-variate analyses have clear limitations in handling such matrix-structured data, several approaches have been proposed, mostly relying on the likelihood of the Gaussian distribution with a separable covariance structure. Although some of these methods provide theoretical guarantees against false inclusions (i.e. all identified edges exist in the true graph), they may suffer from crucial limitations: (1) failure to detect important true edges, or (2) dependency on conditions for the estimators that have not been verified.   We propose a novel regression-based method for estimating matrix graphical models, based on the relationship between partial correlations and regression coefficients. Adopting the primal-dual witness technique from the regression framework, we derive a non-asymptotic inequality for exact recovery of an edge set. Under suitable regularity conditions, our method consistently identifies the true edge set with high probability.   Through simulation studies, we compare the support recovery performance of the proposed method against existing alternatives.

It imposes no requirement on the training sample size, and is shown to achieve zero misclassification error rate asymptotically when the underlying time series differ only mildly in their second-order characteristics. The new method is demonstrated to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art solutions, including wavelet-based, tree-based, convolution-based methods, as well as modern deep learning methods, through intensive numerical simulations and a real EEG data analysis for epilepsy classification."

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition."

A good Machine Learning classifier should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).   We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous."

First, most DL solutions are designed for offline decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data, which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration, we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method. RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate feedback and user learning."

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology."

Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis."

Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered \"Yes\"/\"No\" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring basic communication in CLIS."

Traditionally, efforts have focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI. The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning, and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with similar content and structure from EEG data."

While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments."

However, these methods rely heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation, confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully exploit or integrate."

In particular, compared to cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain dynamics into representative and stable embeddings.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However, existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets, UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be made publicly available at this https://github.com/arunkumar-kannan/BrainMT-fMRI"

      "abstract": "Human languages differ widely in their forms, each having distinct sounds, scripts, and syntax. Yet, they can all convey similar meaning. Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world."

      "abstract": "Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks. This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks. HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes associated with neurocognitive decline."

The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \\( \\delta_{\\rm CP} \\sim 359^\\circ \\), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \\( |m_{ee}| \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \\,\\text{eV} \\), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \\( S_4 \\)-based ISS(2,3) framework."

Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing."

In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.",

Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities.

      "abstract": "Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment."

Their training is costly, slow, and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI."

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications."

Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation."

We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts.

While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

      "abstract": "Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly powerful, the need for safe AI has become more pressing. Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety."

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice."

This study examines the role of olfactory stimuli in enhancing these effects, using a randomized within-subject design. Thirty participants aged 18-60 experienced VR scenarios simulating a calming seaside environment, with sessions lasting 45 minutes, in two conditions: with and without a \"Beach\" essential oil scent (Yankee Candle) administered via diffuser. Stress and relaxation were assessed through self-reported surveys and physiological measures, specifically ECG-based heart rate variability (HRV). Results showed no significant difference in self-reported relaxation scores (p=0.371) between conditions, but HRV analysis revealed a significant stress reduction (p=0.002) with olfactory input, with HF increasing 108% from the Math Stress Test to the scented relaxation condition, compared to 44% without scent. Additionally, 71.4% of participants expressed willingness to use olfactory-enhanced VR for relaxation, suggesting practical appeal. These findings indicate that olfactory stimuli may enhance relaxation subconsciously, underscoring the importance of multisensory integration in VR. Future work could explore personalized scents and long-term effects to optimize VR- based interventions for emotional and physical well-being."

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

      "abstract": "Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables, four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space, enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable, data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a specific event, using both tabular and image data."

      "abstract": "Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors. Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\\% improvement in the Dice Score and a 9.9\\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods, while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and material."

However, SAM's architecture is designed for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage, at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art performance."

By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether dataset bias also exists in these datasets. To extend our work, we apply simple transformations to the datasets, repeat the same task, and perform an analysis to identify and explain any detected biases. Given the importance of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest.

Our research aims to predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network, which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback, coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics, marking a significant advancement in the field."

Additionally, drug molecules can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart.
