      "abstract": "Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks, demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor communications and achieving low detection latency.",

Accurate segmentation of MRI data is critical for medical applications like brain anatomy analysis and disease detection. However, challenges such as intensity inhomogeneity, noise, and artifacts complicate this process. To address these issues, we propose a three-step framework exploiting the idea of Cartoon-Texture evolution to produce a denoised and debiased MR image. The first step involves identifying statistical information about the nature of the noise using a suitable image decomposition. In the second step, a multiplicative intrinsic component model is applied to a smother version of the image, simultaneously reconstructing the bias and removing noise using noise information from the previous step. At the final step, standard clustering techniques are used to create an accurate segmentation. Additionally, we present a convergence analysis of the ADMM scheme for solving the nonlinear optimization problem with multiaffine constraints resulting from the second step. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially in noisy brain segmentation, both from a qualitative and a quantitative viewpoint, compared to similar methods.",

      "abstract": "In the literature of cognitive neuroscience, researchers tend to assume a linear relationship between brain activation level and task performance; however, controversial findings have been reported in participants at different ages and different proficiency levels. Therefore, there may be a non-linear relationship between task performance and brain activation if a full range of task performance is considered. In the current study, using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset we examined the relationship between brain activation and working memory performance in two conditions (i.e. faces and places). We found a gradual change from a U-shaped relationship to an inverted U-shaped relationship along the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis in the face condition. In other words, in low-order sensorimotor areas, it is U-shaped and in the high-order prefrontal and association areas, it is inverted U-shaped, which suggests different properties in the encoding/representation region and in the cognitive calculation regions. However, in the place condition, such a shift is missing, presumably because most of the regions that are sensitive to task performance in the place condition are in the lower end of the S-A axis. Taken together, our study revealed a novel difference of functional property in response to task performance in the sensorimotor areas versus the association areas.",

      "abstract": "Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images $\\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\\boldsymbol{z}$, then disentangle it into $\\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and $\\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images. PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract $\\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image $f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image $\\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition.

While electronic implementations of artificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are attracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast, energy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless, existing photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but neuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer mechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we present a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that responds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based on a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes in response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at infrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F dynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias voltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs. The R-and-F neuron also supports optical fan-in via wavelength-division multiplexed inputs from four vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This electronic-photonic neuron exhibits key functionalities - including spike-frequency filtering, temporal pattern recognition, and digital-to-spiking conversion - critical for neuromorphic optical processing.

      "abstract": "Brains learn to represent information from a large set of stimuli, typically by weak supervision. Unsupervised learning is therefore a natural approach for exploring the design of biological neural networks and their computations. Accordingly, redundancy reduction has been suggested as a prominent design principle of neural encoding, but its ``mechanistic'' biological implementation is unclear. Analogously, unsupervised training of artificial neural networks yields internal representations that allow for accurate stimulus classification or decoding, but typically rely on biologically-implausible implementations. We suggest that interactions between parallel subnetworks in the brain may underlie such learning: we present a model of representation learning by ensembles of neural networks, where each network learns to encode stimuli into an abstract representation space by cross-supervising interactions with other networks, for inputs they receive simultaneously or in close temporal proximity. Aiming for biological plausibility, each network has a small ``receptive field'', thus receiving a fixed part of the external input, and the networks do not share weights. We find that for different types of network architectures, and for both visual or neuronal stimuli, these cross-supervising networks learn semantic representations that are easily decodable and that decoding accuracy is comparable to supervised networks -- both at the level of single networks and the ensemble. We further show that performance is optimal for small receptive fields, and that sparse connectivity between networks is nearly as accurate as all-to-all interactions, with far fewer computations. We thus suggest a sparsely interacting collective of cross-supervising networks as an algorithmic framework for representational learning and collective computation in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging. Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49 studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual) reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce, as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within- and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling, development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and rigorous clinical validation.",

Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance. However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the 20\\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of 0.10\\% for whole tumor, 1.75\\% for tumor core, and 0.93\\% for enhancing tumor. Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice gains of 0.86\\% for tumor core and 1.45\\% for enhancing tumor over existing state-of-the-art.

A complete prediction specifies what will happen, when it will happen, and with what probability, which we refer to as a \"prediction object\". Existing models typically capture only what and when, omit probabilities, and rely on biologically-implausible algorithms. Here we show that a single population of spiking neurons can jointly encode the prediction object through a biologically grounded learning mechanism. We implement a heterogeneous Izhikevich spiking reservoir with readouts trained by an error-modulated, attention-gated three-factor Hebbian rule and test it on a novel paradigm that controls both the timing and probability of upcoming stimuli. By integrating real-time learning of \"when\" with offline consolidation of \"what\", the model encodes the complete prediction object, firing at the correct times with magnitudes proportional to the probabilities. Critically, it rapidly adapts to changes in both stimulus timing and probability, an ability that global least-squares methods such as FORCE lack without explicit resets. During learning, the model self-organizes its readout weights into near-orthogonal subspaces for \"what\" and \"when,\" showing that multiplexed encoding arises naturally from generic recurrent dynamics under local, error-gated modulation. These results challenge the view that \"what\" and \"when\" predictions require separate modules, suggesting instead that mixed selectivity within shared populations supports flexible predictive cognition. The model also predicts phase-specific neuromodulation and overlapping neural subspaces, offering a parsimonious alternative to hierarchical predictive-coding accounts.",

We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition).

To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance.

Early detection, especially at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, is essential for timely intervention. Working Memory (WM) impairment is a key early indicator of neurodegeneration, affecting higher cognitive processes. Electroencephalography (EEG), with its high temporal resolution, offers a cost-effective method to assess brain dynamics. This study investigates WM-related EEG functional connectivity (FC) to identify brain network alterations across dementia stages. Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 24 participants (8 AD, 8 MCI, and 8 healthy controls) during WM tasks, including encoding, recall, and retrieval stages. Data preprocessing involved noise reduction and feature extraction using Spherical and Head Harmonic Decomposition (SHD, HHD). FC was quantified using Cross-Plot Transition Entropy (CPTE) and Phase Lag Index (PLI). Network metrics such as Degree and Eigenvector Centrality were analyzed using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Results: The CPTE-based connectivity metrics outperformed the traditional PLI approach in differentiating dementia stages, attaining a peak classification accuracy of 97.53% during the retrieval phase with the Random Forest model. A connectivity threshold of 0.5 was optimal for network discrimination. SHD and HHD features also demonstrated strong discriminative potential. AD subjects exhibited higher synchronization patterns during WM tasks than healthy controls. Conclusions: The integration of WM tasks with EEG-based FC analysis provides a robust framework for dementia classification. The proposed CPTE-based approach offers a robust, scalable, non-invasive, and effective diagnostic tool for early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Selecting the most relevant channels is crucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights into neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on Effective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity (EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one neural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow of information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel selection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among channels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to three well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved calculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics: partial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC (RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on the effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification across all participants.

However, how to effectively utilize the target-speaker common information between EEG and speech remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we propose a model for brain-controlled speaker extraction, which utilizes the EEG recorded from the listener to extract the target speech. In order to effectively extract information from EEG signals, we derive multi-scale time--frequency features and further incorporate cortical topological structures that are selectively engaged during the task. Moreover, to effectively exploit the non-Euclidean structure of EEG signals and capture their global features, the graph convolutional networks and self-attention mechanism are used in the EEG encoder. In addition, to make full use of the fused EEG and speech feature and preserve global context and capture speech rhythm and prosody, we introduce MossFormer2 which combines MossFormer and RNN-Free Recurrent as separator.

Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.",

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level.

To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions.

This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets, four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and overlapping information.",

We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset.

However, conventional encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid. We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses: (1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns; modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D space.",

Feature importance ranking allows to identify distinct sets of brain regions whose activation patterns are uniquely associated with specific cognitive functions.

While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network.

We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset.

To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement.

FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity.

QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain.

To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

      "abstract": "Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

This study leverages data from comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction variations in healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression, I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the well-being of distinct subgroups.",

With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130 tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23 expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs. It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.",

Each year, more than 300 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly, requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably, R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor types.

However, these approaches often suffer from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain, where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which highlights its potential for real-world adoption.",

The first step involves identifying statistical information about the nature of the noise using a suitable image decomposition. In the second step, a multiplicative intrinsic component model is applied to a smother version of the image, simultaneously reconstructing the bias and removing noise using noise information from the previous step. At the final step, standard clustering techniques are used to create an accurate segmentation.
