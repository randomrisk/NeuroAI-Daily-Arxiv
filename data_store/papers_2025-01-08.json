      "abstract": "Visual perception in the brain largely depends on the organization of neuronal receptive fields. Although extensive research has delineated the coding principles of receptive fields, most studies have been constrained by their foundational assumptions. Moreover, while machine learning has successfully been used to reconstruct images from brain data, this approach faces significant challenges, including inherent feature biases in the model and the complexities of brain structure and function. In this study, we introduce an inverse receptive field attention (IRFA) model, designed to reconstruct naturalistic images from neurophysiological data in an end-to-end fashion. This approach aims to elucidate the tuning properties and representational transformations within the visual cortex. The IRFA model incorporates an attention mechanism that determines the inverse receptive field for each pixel, weighting neuronal responses across the visual field and feature spaces. This method allows for an examination of the dynamics of neuronal representations across stimuli in both spatial and feature dimensions. Our results show highly accurate reconstructions of naturalistic data, independent of pre-trained models. Notably, IRF models trained on macaque V1, V4, and IT regions yield remarkably consistent spatial receptive fields across different stimuli, while the features to which neuronal representations are selective exhibit significant variation. Additionally, we propose a data-driven method to explore representational clustering within various visual areas, further providing testable hypotheses."

In our approach, the network directly parameterizes the unknown density function and is trained using a penalized maximum likelihood framework, with a penalty term formed using manifold differential operators. The network architecture and estimation algorithm are carefully designed to handle the challenges of high-dimensional product manifold domains, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality that limits traditional kernel and basis expansion estimators, as well as overcoming the convergence issues encountered by non-specialized neural network methods. Extensive simulations and a real-world application to brain structural connectivity data highlight the clear advantages of our method over the competing alternatives."

Key-value memory systems, in contrast, distinguish representations used for storage (values) and those used for retrieval (keys). This allows key-value memory systems to optimize simultaneously for fidelity in storage and discriminability in retrieval. We review the computational foundations of key-value memory, its role in modern machine learning systems, related ideas from psychology and neuroscience, applications to a number of empirical puzzles, and possible biological implementations.",

Physical reservoir computing (PRC), leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of physical systems for information processing, has emerged as a promising approach for neuromorphic computing. However, current PRC systems are constrained by narrow operating timescales and limited performance. To address these challenges, an ion-gel/graphene electric double layer transistor-based ion-gating reservoir (IGR) was developed, offering adaptability across multi-time scales with an exceptionally wide operating range from 1 MHz to 20 Hz and high information processing capacity. The IGR achieved deep learning (DL)-level accuracy in chaotic time series prediction tasks while reducing computational resource requirements to 1/100 of those needed by DL. Principal component analysis reveals the IGR's superior performance stems from its high-dimensionality, driven by the ambipolar behavior of graphene and multiple relaxation processes. The proposed IGR represents a significant step forward in providing low-power, high-performance computing solutions, particularly for resource-constrained edge environments."

Through a review of the Bayesian framework, we demonstrate its superiority in evaluating specificity by incorporating probabilistic modeling and robust reverse inference. The work also emphasizes the pivotal role of well-defined control conditions in mitigating overlap among brain pathologies, particularly within shared networks like the salience network.

We also seek to better understand how this relates to their perceived productivity. Method: We propose a controlled observational study combining physiological measurements (EEG and eye tracking) with interaction data to examine developers' use of AI-assisted programming tools. We will recruit professional developers to complete programming tasks both with and without AI assistance while measuring their cognitive load and task completion time. Through pre- and post-task questionnaires, we will collect data on perceived productivity and cognitive load using NASA-TLX."

To address these gaps, we introduce EmoMV, an emotion-driven music-to-visual manipulation method that manipulates images based on musical emotions. EmoMV combines bottom-up processing of music elements-such as pitch and rhythm-with top-down application of these emotions to visual aspects like color and lighting. We evaluate EmoMV using a multi-scale framework that includes image quality metrics, aesthetic assessments, and EEG measurements to capture real-time emotional responses.

We argue that at this time, a strong emphasis on human-AI teaming, in contrast to fully autonomous AI BCI researcher will be the most promising way forward. We introduce the collaborative workspaces concept for human-AI teaming based on a set of Janusian design principles, looking both ways, to the human as well as to the AI side. Based on these principles, we present ChatBCI, a Python-based toolbox for enabling human-AI collaboration based on interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for BCI research and development projects. We show how ChatBCI was successfully used in a concrete BCI project on advancing motor imagery decoding from EEG signals.

      "abstract": "Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications."

Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems."

While some approaches aim for full autonomy of the scientific AI, others rather aim for leveraging human-AI teaming. Here, we address how to adapt such approaches for boosting Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development, as well as brain research resp. neuroscience at large. We argue that at this time, a strong emphasis on human-AI teaming, in contrast to fully autonomous AI BCI researcher will be the most promising way forward. We introduce the collaborative workspaces concept for human-AI teaming based on a set of Janusian design principles, looking both ways, to the human as well as to the AI side. Based on these principles, we present ChatBCI, a Python-based toolbox for enabling human-AI collaboration based on interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for BCI research and development projects. We show how ChatBCI was successfully used in a concrete BCI project on advancing motor imagery decoding from EEG signals. Our approach can be straightforwardly extended to broad neurotechnological and neuroscientific topics, and may by design facilitate human expert knowledge transfer to scientific AI systems in general."

To address this issue, we propose EEG-Reptile, an automated library that leverages meta-learning to improve classification accuracy of neural networks in BCIs and other EEG-based applications. It utilizes the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to adapt neural network classifiers of EEG data to the inter-subject domain, allowing for more efficient fine-tuning for a new subject on a small amount of data. The proposed library incorporates an automated hyperparameter tuning module, a data management pipeline, and an implementation of the Reptile meta-learning algorithm.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEG-Reptile on two benchmark datasets (BCI IV 2a, Lee2019 MI) and three neural network architectures (EEGNet, FBCNet, EEG-Inception).

Extensive research has been conducted to improve classification in the RSVP typing task, achieving fast classification. However, these methods struggle to achieve high accuracy and do not consider the typing mechanism in the learning procedure. They apply binary target and non-target classification without including recursive training. To improve performance in the classification of symbols while controlling the classification speed, we incorporate the typing setup into training by proposing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the RSVP typing task as a POMDP for recursive classification. Experiments show that the proposed approach, MarkovType, results in a more accurate typing system compared to competitors.

Specifically, we focus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where electroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening serve as input. By training an EEG recognition model to predict ANN representations-representations associated with music identification-we observed a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach to developing recognition models for brain recordings in response to external auditory stimuli.

Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships."

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening."

Project #1 (Chapter 4) explores how neurons encode features of the external world. I combine Helmholtz's \"Perception as Unconscious Inference\" -- paralleled by modern generative models like variational autoencoders (VAE) -- with the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. This combination leads to the development of a hierarchical VAE model, which I test for its ability to mimic neurons from the primate visual cortex in response to motion stimuli. Results show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate brain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion inputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner. Collectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding.   Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of spontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using simultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates that the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with around half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities. Comparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from fMRI and Ca2+ signals.

It stands as one of the most common mental disorders globally and ranks as the second leading cause of disability. The current diagnostic approach for MDD primarily relies on clinical observations and patient-reported symptoms, overlooking the diverse underlying causes and pathophysiological factors contributing to depression. Therefore, scientific researchers and clinicians must gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MDD. There is growing evidence in neuroscience that depression is a brain network disorder, and the use of neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plays a significant role in identifying and treating MDD. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is among the most popular neuroimaging techniques used to study MDD. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to neuroimaging data to help with early mental health disorder detection. Recent years have seen a rise in interest in graph neural networks (GNNs), which are deep neural architectures specifically designed to handle graph-structured data like rs-fMRI. This research aimed to develop an ensemble-based GNN model capable of detecting discriminative features from rs-fMRI images for the purpose of diagnosing MDD. Specifically, we constructed an ensemble model by combining features from multiple brain region segmentation atlases to capture brain complexity and detect distinct features more accurately than single atlas-based models. Further, the effectiveness of our model is demonstrated by assessing its performance on a large multi-site MDD dataset. The best performing model among all folds achieved an accuracy of 75.80%, a sensitivity of 88.89%, a specificity of 61.84%, a precision of 71.29%, and an F1-score of 79.12%."

Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As \\textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality conditions.

      "abstract": "The brain uses contextual information and prior knowledge to anticipate upcoming content during language comprehension. Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening."

      "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the epileptic foci can be pinpointed by source localizing interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) via Magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, manual detection of IEDs, which appear as spikes in MEG data, is extremely labor intensive and requires considerable professional expertise, limiting the broader adoption of MEG technology. Numerous studies have focused on automatic detection of MEG spikes to overcome this challenge, but these efforts often validate their models on synthetic datasets with balanced positive and negative samples. In contrast, clinical MEG data is highly imbalanced, raising doubts on the real-world efficacy of these models. To address this issue, we introduce LV-CadeNet, a Long View feature Convolution-Attention fusion Encoder-Decoder Network, designed for automatic MEG spike detection in real-world clinical scenarios. Beyond addressing the disparity between training data distribution and clinical test data through semi-supervised learning, our approach also mimics human specialists by constructing long view morphological input data. Moreover, we propose an advanced convolution-attention module to extract temporal and spatial features from the input data. LV-CadeNet significantly improves the accuracy of MEG spike detection, boosting it from 42.31\\% to 54.88\\% on a novel clinical dataset sourced from Sanbo Brain Hospital Capital Medical University. This dataset, characterized by a highly imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, accurately represents real-world clinical scenarios."

      "abstract": "Deep learning has recently enabled the decoding of language from the neural activity of a few participants with electrodes implanted inside their brain. However, reliably decoding words from non-invasive recordings remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language."

      "abstract": "Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential."

      "abstract": "The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \\in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions."

In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3.

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially."

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "Anisotropic X-ray Dark-Field Tomography (AXDT) is a novel imaging technology that enables the extraction of fiber structures on the micrometer scale, far smaller than standard X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) setups. Directional and structural information is relevant in medical diagnostics and material testing. Compared to existing solutions, AXDT could prove a viable alternative. Reconstruction methods in AXDT have so far been driven by practicality. Improved methods could make AXDT more accessible. We contribute numerically stable implementations and validation of advanced statistical reconstruction methods that incorporate the statistical noise behavior of the imaging system. We further provide a new statistical reconstruction formulation that retains the advanced noise assumptions of the imaging setup while being efficient and easy to optimize. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the optimization behavior for all models regarding AXDT. Our experiments show that statistical reconstruction outperforms the previously used model, and particularly the noise performance is superior. While the previously proposed statistical method is effective, it is computationally expensive, and our newly proposed formulation proves highly efficient with identical performance. Our theoretical analysis opens the possibility to new and more advanced reconstruction algorithms, which in turn enable future research in AXDT."

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of 19 external factors, related to weather, road traffic conditions, air quality, and time, on the occurrence of emergencies using historical data provided by the dispatch center of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV). This center is responsible for managing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) resources in the majority of the French-speaking part of Switzerland. First, classical statistical methods, such as correlation, Chi-squared test, Student's $t$-test, and information value, are employed to identify dependencies between the occurrence of emergencies and the considered parameters. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and permutation importance are computed using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The results indicate that the hour of the day, along with correlated parameters, plays a crucial role in the occurrence of emergencies. Conversely, other factors do not significantly influence emergency occurrences. Subsequently, a simplified model that considers only the hour of the day is compared with our XGBoost and MLP models. These comparisons reveal no significant difference between the three models in terms of performance, supporting the use of the basic model in this context. These observations provide valuable insights for EMS resource relocation strategies, benefit predictive modeling efforts, and inform decision-making in the context of EMS. The implications extend to enhancing EMS quality, making this research essential."

      "abstract": "Decoupling domain-variant information (DVI) from domain-invariant information (DII) serves as a prominent strategy for mitigating domain shifts in the practical implementation of deep learning algorithms. However, in medical settings, concerns surrounding data collection and privacy often restrict access to both training and test data, hindering the empirical decoupling of information by existing methods. To tackle this issue, we propose an Autonomous Information Filter-driven Source-free Domain Adaptation (AIF-SFDA) algorithm, which leverages a frequency-based learnable information filter to autonomously decouple DVI and DII. Information Bottleneck (IB) and Self-supervision (SS) are incorporated to optimize the learnable frequency filter. The IB governs the information flow within the filter to diminish redundant DVI, while SS preserves DII in alignment with the specific task and image modality. Thus, the autonomous information filter can overcome domain shifts relying solely on target data. A series of experiments covering various medical image modalities and segmentation tasks were conducted to demonstrate the benefits of AIF-SFDA through comparisons with leading algorithms and ablation studies.

      "abstract": "When developing devices, architectures and services for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) world, manufacturers or integrators must be aware of the security requirements expressed by both laws and specifications. To provide tools guiding through these requirements and to assure a third party of the correct compliance, an ontology charting the relevant laws and specifications (for the European context) is very useful. We here address the development of this ontology. Due to the very high number and size of the considered specification documents, we have put in place a methodology and tools to simplify the transition from natural text to an ontology. The first step is a manual highlighting of relevant concepts in the corpus, then a manual translation to XML/XSD is operated. We have developed a tool allowing us to convert this semi-structured data into an ontology. Because the different specifications use similar but different wording, our approach favors the creation of similar instances in the ontology. To improve the ontology simplification through instance merging, we consider the use of LLMs. The responses of the LLMs are compared against our manually defined correct responses. The quality of the responses of the automated system does not prove to be good enough to be trusted blindly, and should only be used as a starting point for a manual correction."

      "abstract": "Robotic rehabilitation can deliver high-dose gait therapy and improve motor function after a stroke. However, for many devices, high costs and lengthy setup times limit clinical adoption. Thus, we designed, built, and evaluated the Passive Mechanical Add-on for Treadmill Exercise (P-MATE), a low-cost passive end-effector add-on for treadmills that couples the movement of the paretic and non-paretic legs via a reciprocating system of elastic cables and pulleys. Two human-device mechanical interfaces were designed to attach the elastic cables to the user. The P-MATE and two interface prototypes were tested with a physical therapist and eight unimpaired participants. Biomechanical data, including kinematics and interaction forces, were collected alongside standardized questionnaires to assess usability and user experience. Both interfaces were quick and easy to attach, though user experience differed, highlighting the need for personalization. We also identified areas for future improvement, including pretension adjustments, tendon derailing prevention, and understanding long-term impacts on user gait. Our preliminary findings underline the potential of the P-MATE to provide effective, accessible, and sustainable stroke gait rehabilitation."

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for accurate remote medical assessments, emphasizing the importance of precise tongue attribute recognition via telehealth. To address this, we propose a Sign-Oriented multi-label Attributes Detection framework. Our approach begins with an adaptive tongue feature extraction module that standardizes tongue images and mitigates environmental factors. This is followed by a Sign-oriented Network (SignNet) that identifies specific tongue attributes, emulating the diagnostic process of experienced practitioners and enabling comprehensive health evaluations. To validate our methodology, we developed an extensive tongue image dataset specifically designed for telemedicine. Unlike existing datasets, ours is tailored for remote diagnosis, with a comprehensive set of attribute labels. This dataset will be openly available, providing a valuable resource for research. Initial tests have shown improved accuracy in detecting various tongue attributes, highlighting our framework's potential as an essential tool for remote medical assessments."

      "abstract": "Reducing MRI scan times can improve patient care and lower healthcare costs. Many acceleration methods are designed to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from limited sets of acquired $\\textit{k}$-space data. This task can be framed as a linear inverse problem (LIP), where, as a result of undersampling, the forward operator may become rank-deficient or exhibit small singular values. This results in ambiguities in reconstruction, in which multiple generally incorrect or non-diagnostic images can map to the same acquired data. To address such ambiguities, it is crucial to incorporate prior knowledge, for example in the form of regularization. Another form of prior knowledge less commonly used in medical imaging is contextual side information garnered from other sources than the current acquisition. Here, we propose the $\\textbf{T}$rust-$\\textbf{G}$uided $\\textbf{V}$ariational $\\textbf{N}$etwork $\\textbf{(TGVN)}$, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively integrates side information into LIPs. TGVN eliminates undesirable solutions from the ambiguous space of the forward operator while remaining faithful to the acquired data. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multi-coil, multi-contrast MR image reconstruction, where incomplete or low-quality measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct high-quality images of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. Our method is robust across different contrasts, anatomies, and field strengths. Compared to baselines that also utilize side information, TGVN achieves superior image quality at challenging under-sampling levels, drastically speeding up acquisition while minimizing hallucinations. Our approach is also versatile enough to incorporate many different types of side information (including previous scans or even text) into any LIP."

      "abstract": "Accurate instrument pose estimation is a crucial step towards the future of robotic surgery, enabling applications such as autonomous surgical task execution. Vision-based methods for surgical instrument pose estimation provide a practical approach to tool tracking, but they often require markers to be attached to the instruments. Recently, more research has focused on the development of marker-less methods based on deep learning. However, acquiring realistic surgical data, with ground truth instrument poses, required for deep learning training, is challenging. To address the issues in surgical instrument pose estimation, we introduce the Surgical Robot Instrument Pose Estimation (SurgRIPE) challenge, hosted at the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023. The objectives of this challenge are: (1) to provide the surgical vision community with realistic surgical video data paired with ground truth instrument poses, and (2) to establish a benchmark for evaluating markerless pose estimation methods. The challenge led to the development of several novel algorithms that showcased improved accuracy and robustness over existing methods. The performance evaluation study on the SurgRIPE dataset highlights the potential of these advanced algorithms to be integrated into robotic surgery systems, paving the way for more precise and autonomous surgical procedures. The SurgRIPE challenge has successfully established a new benchmark for the field, encouraging further research and development in surgical robot instrument pose estimation."

      "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods allow for gigapixel Whole-Slide Image (WSI) analysis with only slide-level annotations. Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification."
