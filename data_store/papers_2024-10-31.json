      "abstract": "The promise of large-scale, high-resolution datasets from Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-ray Microtomography (XRM) lies in their ability to reveal neural structures and synaptic connectivity, which is critical for understanding the brain. Effectively managing these complex and rapidly increasing datasets will enable new scientific insights, facilitate querying, and support secondary use across the neuroscience community. However, without effective neurodata standards that permit use of these data across multiple systems and workflows, these valuable and costly datasets risk being underutilized especially as they surpass petascale levels. These standards will promote data sharing through accessible interfaces, allow researchers to build on each other's work, and guide the development of tools and capabilities that are interoperable. Herein we outline a standards framework for creating and managing annotations originating and derived from high-resolution volumetric imaging and connectomic datasets, focusing on ensuring Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) practices. The goal is to enhance collaborative efforts, boost the reliability of findings, and enable comparative analysis across growing datasets of different species and modalities. We have formed a global working group with academic and industry partners in the high-resolution volumetric data generation and analysis community, focused on identifying gaps in current EM and XRM data pipelines, and refining outlines and platforms for standardizing EM and XRM methods. This focus considers existing and past community approaches and includes examining neuronal entities, biological components, and associated metadata, while emphasizing adaptability and fostering collaboration."

      "abstract": "Medical image registration is a critical process that aligns various patient scans, facilitating tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and tracking. Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.",

We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio.

With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance."

      "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of brain metastases (BMs) in MR image is crucial for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. Methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high segmentation performance. However, due to the loss of critical feature information caused by convolutional and pooling operations, CNNs still face great challenges in small BMs segmentation. Besides, BMs are irregular and easily confused with healthy tissues, which makes it difficult for the model to effectively learn tumor structure during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model called feature-guided attention network with curriculum learning (FANCL). Based on CNNs, FANCL utilizes the input image and its feature to establish the intrinsic connections between metastases of different sizes, which can effectively compensate for the loss of high-level feature from small tumors with the information of large tumors. Furthermore, FANCL applies the voxel-level curriculum learning strategy to help the model gradually learn the structure and details of BMs. And baseline models of varying depths are employed as curriculum-mining networks for organizing the curriculum progression. The evaluation results on the BraTS-METS 2023 dataset indicate that FANCL significantly improves the segmentation performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method."

      "abstract": "As AI closely interacts with human society, it is crucial to ensure that its decision-making is safe, altruistic, and aligned with human ethical and moral values. However, existing research on embedding ethical and moral considerations into AI remains insufficient, and previous external constraints based on principles and rules are inadequate to provide AI with long-term stability and generalization capabilities. In contrast, the intrinsic altruistic motivation based on empathy is more willing, spontaneous, and robust. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to autonomously driving intelligent agents to acquire morally behaviors through human-like affective empathy mechanisms. We draw inspiration from the neural mechanism of human brain's moral intuitive decision-making, and simulate the mirror neuron system to construct a brain-inspired affective empathy-driven altruistic decision-making model. Here, empathy directly impacts dopamine release to form intrinsic altruistic motivation. Based on the principle of moral utilitarianism, we design the moral reward function that integrates intrinsic empathy and extrinsic self-task goals. A comprehensive experimental scenario incorporating empathetic processes, personal objectives, and altruistic goals is developed. The proposed model enables the agent to make consistent moral decisions (prioritizing altruism) by balancing self-interest with the well-being of others. We further introduce inhibitory neurons to regulate different levels of empathy and verify the positive correlation between empathy levels and altruistic preferences, yielding conclusions consistent with findings from psychological behavioral experiments. This work provides a feasible solution for the development of ethical AI by leveraging the intrinsic human-like empathy mechanisms, and contributes to the harmonious coexistence between humans and AI."

However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this study for brain tumor classification, based on transfer learning and the Vision Mamba model, is broadly applicable to other medical imaging classification problems."

To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices.

To address this challenge, we advocate for predictive systems that provide timely alerts to individuals at risk, enabling them to take precautionary actions. Our framework employs advanced DL techniques and uses personalized data from a network of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions.

Among the emotional words, taboo words represent a specific category that has been poorly studied. One intriguing question is whether these word categories can be predicted from EEG responses with the use of machine learning methods. To address this question, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to decode the word categories from Event Related Potential (ERP) in 40 native Italian speakers. 240 neutral, negative and taboo words were used to this aim. Results indicate that the SVM classifier successfully distinguished between the three-word categories, with significant differences in neural activity ascribed to the late positive potential mainly detected in the central-parietal-occipital and anterior right scalp areas in the time windows of 450-649 ms and 650-850 ms. These findings were in line with the established distribution pattern of the late positive potential. Intriguingly, the study also revealed that word categories were still detectable in the regulate condition. This study extends previous results on the domain of the cortical responses of taboo words, and how machine learning methods can be used to predict word categories from EEG responses."

This study proposes a multi-signal prediction algorithm based on generative diffusion models (EEG-DIF), which transforms the multi-signal forecasting task into an image completion task, allowing for comprehensive representation and learning of the spatio-temporal correlations and future developmental patterns of multi-channel EEG signals. Here, we employ a publicly available epilepsy EEG dataset to construct and validate the EEG-DIF. The results demonstrate that our method can accurately predict future trends for multi-channel EEG signals simultaneously. Furthermore, the early warning accuracy for epilepsy seizures based on the generated EEG data reaches 0.89. In general, EEG-DIF provides a novel approach for characterizing multi-channel EEG signals and an innovative early warning algorithm for epilepsy seizures, aiding in optimizing and enhancing the clinical diagnosis process.

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neuromuscular degenerative disease, severely restricts patient communication capacity within a few years of onset, resulting in a significant deterioration of quality of life. The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.",

Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification.

This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance."

Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise.

The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants.

However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning."

Current studies mostly use linear encoding models for clarity, even though brain responses are often nonlinear. This has sparked interest in developing nonlinear encoding models that are still interpretable. To address this problem, we propose LinBridge, a learnable and flexible framework based on Jacobian analysis for interpreting nonlinear encoding models. LinBridge posits that the nonlinear mapping between ANN representations and neural responses can be factorized into a linear inherent component that approximates the complex nonlinear relationship, and a mapping bias that captures sample-selective nonlinearity. The Jacobian matrix, which reflects output change rates relative to input, enables the analysis of sample-selective mapping in nonlinear models. LinBridge employs a self-supervised learning strategy to extract both the linear inherent component and nonlinear mapping biases from the Jacobian matrices of the test set, allowing it to adapt effectively to various nonlinear encoding models. We validate the LinBridge framework in the scenario of neural visual encoding, using computational visual representations from CLIP-ViT to predict brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the linear inherent component extracted by LinBridge accurately reflects the complex mappings of nonlinear neural encoding models; 2) the sample-selective mapping bias elucidates the variability of nonlinearity across different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. This study presents a novel tool for interpreting nonlinear neural encoding models and offers fresh evidence about hierarchical nonlinearity distribution in the visual cortex."

Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles."

However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures.   The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches.   By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented.

However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN."

This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44.

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP)."

      "abstract": "The growing use of naturalistic stimuli, such as feature films, brings research on emotions closer to ecologically valid settings within brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control."

Traditionally, studies in the field have been compartmentalized by signal type, with EEG, MEG, ECoG, SEEG, fMRI, and fNIRS data being analyzed in isolation. Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F.

However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces."

Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data. To address this, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.

We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.",

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is pivotal in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, informing treatment strategies, and tracking disease progression. This process allows clinicians to extract critical information from visual data, enabling personalized patient care. However, developing neural networks for segmentation remains challenging, especially when preserving image resolution, which is essential in detecting subtle details that influence diagnoses. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these deep learning models has slowed their adoption in clinical practice. Efforts in model interpretability are increasingly focused on making these models' decision-making processes more transparent. In this paper, we introduce MAPUNetR, a novel architecture that synergizes the strengths of transformer models with the proven U-Net framework for medical image segmentation. Our model addresses the resolution preservation challenge and incorporates attention maps highlighting segmented regions, increasing accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, MAPUNetR achieved a dice score of 0.88 and a dice coefficient of 0.92 on the ISIC 2018 dataset. Our experiments show that the model maintains stable performance and potential as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation in clinical practice."

MedVLP can provide useful features to downstream tasks and facilitate adapting task-specific models to new setups using fewer examples. However, existing MedVLP methods often differ in terms of datasets, preprocessing, and finetuning implementations. This pose great challenges in evaluating how well a MedVLP method generalizes to various clinically-relevant tasks due to the lack of unified, standardized, and comprehensive benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that the performance of some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP.

For the latter, water-equivalent gas was considered for gas-sealed ionization chambers. Reference dosimetry was performed virtually for test beams. \\emph{Main results.} For photon and electron beams, the ionization dose was essentially equivalent to the absorbed dose. For proton and ion beams, dosimetric uncertainties were greatly reduced, especially with water-equivalent gas, to \\SI{0.7}{\\%} and \\SI{1.0}{\\%}, respectively. Nitrogen-based water-equivalent gas mixtures were designed with helium, methane, and ethane. Dosimetry with the helium mixture was prone and sensitive to leakage, while the methane and ethane mixtures were flammable. \\emph{Significance.} The ionization dose with reduced beam quality corrections provides dose representations of improved accuracy and relevance to radiation therapy, particularly for proton and ion beams."

In image processing research, removing noise from images before further analysis is essential. Post-noise removal of images improves clarity, enabling better interpretation and analysis across medical imaging, satellite imagery, and radar applications. While numerous algorithms exist, each comes with its own assumptions, strengths, and limitations. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different filtering techniques on images with eight types of noise. It evaluates methodologies like Wiener, Median, Gaussian, Mean, Low pass, High pass, Laplacian and bilateral filtering, using the performance metric Peak signal to noise ratio. It shows us the impact of different filters on noise models by applying a variety of filters to various kinds of noise.

Despite their importance, the use of PET/CT systems is limited by the necessity for radioactive materials, the scarcity of PET scanners, and the high cost associated with PET imaging. In contrast, CT scanners are more widely available and significantly less expensive. In response to these challenges, our study addresses the issue of generating PET images from CT images, aiming to reduce both the medical examination cost and the associated health risks for patients. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a conditional diffusion model named CPDM, which, to our knowledge, is one of the initial attempts to employ a diffusion model for translating from CT to PET images. Second, we provide the largest CT-PET dataset to date, comprising 2,028,628 paired CT-PET images, which facilitates the training and evaluation of CT-to-PET translation models. For the CPDM model, we incorporate domain knowledge to develop two conditional maps: the Attention map and the Attenuation map. The former helps the diffusion process focus on areas of interest, while the latter improves PET data correction and ensures accurate diagnostic information. Experimental evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that CPDM surpasses existing methods in generating high-quality PET images in terms of multiple metrics.

Consequently, the attached labels tend to be noisy. In this paper, we propose a new framework for training with ``ordinal'' noisy labels. Since severity levels have an ordinal relationship, we can leverage this to train a classifier while mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels. Our framework uses two techniques: clean sample selection and dual-network architecture. A technical highlight of our approach is the use of soft labels derived from noisy hard labels. By appropriately using the soft and hard labels in the two techniques, we achieve more accurate sample selection and robust network training. The proposed method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in experiments using two endoscopic ulcerative colitis (UC) datasets and a retinal Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) dataset.

However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this study for brain tumor classification, based on transfer learning and the Vision Mamba model, is broadly applicable to other medical imaging classification problems."

These methods guide the generation process with new conditions while leveraging the capabilities of large models. They could be beneficial as training strategies in the context of 3D medical imaging, where training a diffusion model from scratch is challenging due to high computational costs and data scarcity. However, the potential application of spatial control methods with additional modules to 3D medical images has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present a tailored spatial control method for 3D medical images with a novel lightweight module, Volumetric Conditioning Module (VCM). Our VCM employs an asymmetric U-Net architecture to effectively encode complex information from various levels of 3D conditions, providing detailed guidance in image synthesis. To examine the applicability of spatial control methods and the effectiveness of VCM for 3D medical data, we conduct experiments under single- and multimodal conditions scenarios across a wide range of dataset sizes, from extremely small datasets with 10 samples to large datasets with 500 samples. The experimental results show that the VCM is effective for conditional generation and efficient in terms of requiring less training data and computational resources.
