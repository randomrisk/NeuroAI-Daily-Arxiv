      "abstract": "The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field."

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science."

      "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs), a brain-inspired computing paradigm, are emerging for their inference performance, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and latency attributed to the plasticity in signal processing. To deploy SNNs in ubiquitous computing systems, signal encoding of sensors is crucial for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Using inertial sensor readings for gym activity recognition as a case study, this work comprehensively evaluates four main encoding schemes and deploys the corresponding SNN on the neuromorphic processor Loihi2 for post-deployment encoding assessment. Rate encoding, time-to-first-spike encoding, binary encoding, and delta modulation are evaluated using metrics like average fire rate, signal-to-noise ratio, classification accuracy, robustness, and inference latency and energy. In this case study, the time-to-first-spike encoding required the lowest firing rate (2%) and achieved a comparative accuracy (89%), although it was the least robust scheme against error spikes (over 20% accuracy drop with 0.1 noisy spike rate). Rate encoding with optimal value-to-probability mapping achieved the highest accuracy (91.7%). Binary encoding provided a balance between information reconstruction and noise resistance. Multi-threshold delta modulation showed the best robustness, with only a 0.7% accuracy drop at a 0.1 noisy spike rate. This work serves researchers in selecting the best encoding scheme for SNN-based ubiquitous sensor signal processing, tailored to specific performance requirements."

Despite decades of research, ambiguities persist on principles of intuition. Experimental psychology reveals many types of intuition, which depend on state of the human mind. We focus on visual intuition, useful for completing missing information during visual cognitive tasks. First, we set up a scenario to gradually decrease the amount of visual information in the images of a dataset to examine its impact on CNN accuracy. Then, we represent a model for visual intuition using Gestalt theory. The theory claims that humans derive a set of templates according to their subconscious experiences. When the brain decides that there is missing information in a scene, such as occlusion, it instantaneously completes the information by replacing the missing parts with the most similar ones. Based upon Gestalt theory, we model the visual intuition, in two layers. Details of these layers are provided throughout the paper. We use the MNIST data set to test the suggested intuition model for completing the missing information. Experiments show that the augmented CNN architecture provides higher performances compared to the classic models when using incomplete images."

By utilizing the surrogate gradient estimation for discrete spikes, learning-based SNN training methods that can achieve ultra-low inference latency (number of time-step) emerge recently. Nevertheless, due to the difficulty in deriving precise gradient estimation for discrete spikes using learning-based method, a distinct accuracy gap persists between SNN and its artificial neural networks (ANNs) counterpart. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a blurred knowledge distillation (BKD) technique, which leverages random blurred SNN feature to restore and imitate the ANN feature. Note that, our BKD is applied upon the feature map right before the last layer of SNN, which can also mix with prior logits-based knowledge distillation for maximized accuracy boost. To our best knowledge, in the category of learning-based methods, our work achieves state-of-the-art performance for training SNNs on both static and neuromorphic datasets. On ImageNet dataset, BKDSNN outperforms prior best results by 4.51% and 0.93% with the network topology of CNN and Transformer respectively."

The network associates incoming data with the past experience stored as semantic vectors. The network and the semantic memory are physically implemented on noise-robust ternary memristor-based Computing-In-Memory (CIM) and Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) circuits, respectively. We validate our co-designs, using a 40nm memristor macro, on ResNet and PointNet++ for classifying images and 3D points from the MNIST and ModelNet datasets, which not only achieves accuracy on par with software but also a 48.1% and 15.9% reduction in computational budget.

      "abstract": "Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration, to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice, on important problems across science and industry, make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as Parameter Inference from a Non-stationary Unknown Process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem, and categorize the various algorithmic contributions. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on - notably the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map - are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena."

Moreover, the limited availability of well-annotated datasets constrains the development of robust analysis models. Against this backdrop, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging the inherent anatomical symmetrical features of the human brain to enhance the subsequent detection and segmentation analysis for brain diseases. A novel Symmetry-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) module is proposed to encode symmetrical features of left and right hemispheres, and a proxy task to detect symmetrical features as the Symmetry-Aware Head (SAH) is proposed, which guides the pretraining of the whole network on a vast 3D brain imaging dataset comprising both healthy and diseased brain images across various MRI and CT. Through meticulous experimentation on downstream tasks, including both classification and segmentation for brain diseases, our model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methodologies, particularly highlighting the significance of symmetry-aware learning. Our findings advocate for the effectiveness of incorporating symmetry awareness into pretraining and set a new benchmark for medical imaging analysis, promising significant strides toward accurate and efficient diagnostic processes.

However, the local and global properties of the brain's white matter networks are often overlooked in convolutional network design. We introduce TractGraphFormer, a hybrid Graph CNN-Transformer deep learning framework tailored for diffusion MRI tractography. This model leverages local anatomical characteristics and global feature dependencies of white matter structures. The Graph CNN module captures white matter geometry and grey matter connectivity to aggregate local features from anatomically similar white matter connections, while the Transformer module uses self-attention to enhance global information learning. Additionally, TractGraphFormer includes an attention module for interpreting predictive white matter connections. In sex prediction tests, TractGraphFormer shows strong performance in large datasets of children (n=9345) and young adults (n=1065). Overall, our approach suggests that widespread connections in the WM are predictive of the sex of an individual, and consistent predictive anatomical tracts are identified across the two datasets. The proposed approach highlights the potential of integrating local anatomical information and global feature dependencies to improve prediction performance in machine learning with diffusion MRI tractography."

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used in diagnosing ADHD, but proper preprocessing is crucial to avoid noise and artifacts that could lead to unreliable results.   Method: This study utilized a public EEG dataset from children diagnosed with ADHD and typically developing (TD) children. Four preprocessing techniques were applied: no preprocessing (Raw), Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). EEG recordings were segmented, and features were extracted and selected based on statistical significance. Classification was performed using Machine Learning models, as XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors.   Results: The absence of preprocessing leads to artificially high classification accuracy due to noise. In contrast, ASR and ICA preprocessing techniques significantly improved the reliability of results. Segmenting EEG recordings revealed that later segments provided better classification accuracy, likely due to the manifestation of ADHD symptoms over time. The most relevant EEG channels were P3, P4, and C3. The top features for classification included Kurtosis, Katz fractal dimension, and power spectral density of Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands.   Conclusions: Effective preprocessing is essential in EEG-based ADHD diagnosis to prevent noise-induced biases. This study identifies crucial EEG channels and features, providing a foundation for further research and improving ADHD diagnostic accuracy. Future work should focus on expanding datasets, refining preprocessing methods, and enhancing feature interpretability to improve diagnostic accuracy and model robustness for clinical use."

Current nonstationary signal decomposition methods are designed to either obtain constituent AM-FM oscillatory modes or the discontinuous and residual components from the data, separately. Yet, many real-world signals of interest simultaneously exhibit both behaviors i.e., jumps and oscillations. Currently, no available method can extract jumps and AM-FM oscillatory components directly from the data. In our novel approach, we design and solve a variational optimization problem to accomplish this task. The optimization formulation includes a regularization term to minimize the bandwidth of all signal modes for effective oscillation modeling, and a prior for extracting the jump component. Our method addresses the limitations of conventional AM-FM signal decomposition methods in extracting jumps, as well as the limitations of existing jump extraction methods in decomposing multiscale oscillations. By employing an optimization framework that accounts for both multiscale oscillatory components and discontinuities, our methods show superior performance compared to existing decomposition techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on synthetic, real-world, single-channel, and multivariate data, highlighting their utility in three specific applications: Earth's electric field signals, electrocardiograms (ECG), and electroencephalograms (EEG)."

Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to decode speech is particularly promising due to its non-invasive nature. However, recordings are typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\\% and a top-10 accuracy of 76\\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the data was limited to the typical amount used in practice ($\\sim$10 hours), the top-1 accuracy dropped to 2.5\\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical realization of EEG-based speech BCIs."

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) data is often collected from diverse contexts involving different populations and EEG devices. This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine the advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical applications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials."

The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information. However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively. We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years. In addition, the results also show that the MVGT could extract information from multiple domains and capture inter-channel relationships in EEG emotion recognition tasks effectively."

Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to decode speech is particularly promising due to its non-invasive nature. However, recordings are typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\\% and a top-10 accuracy of 76\\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the data was limited to the typical amount used in practice ($\\sim$10 hours), the top-1 accuracy dropped to 2.5\\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical realization of EEG-based speech BCIs."

Considering many users struggle with effective control of MI-BCI systems, a more user-centered approach to training might help motivate users and facilitate learning, alleviating inefficiency of the BCI system. With the increase of BCI-controlled games, researchers have suggested using game principles for BCI training, as games are naturally centered on the player. This review identifies and evaluates the application of game design elements to MI-BCI training, a process known as gamification. Through a systematic literature search, we examined how MI-BCI training protocols have been gamified and how specific game elements impacted the training outcomes. We identified 86 studies that employed gamified MI-BCI protocols in the past decade. The prevalence and reported effects of individual game elements on user experience and performance were extracted and synthesized. Results reveal that MI-BCI training protocols are most often gamified by having users move an avatar in a virtual environment that provides visual feedback. Furthermore, in these virtual environments, users were provided with goals that guided their actions. Using gamification, the reviewed protocols allowed users to reach effective MI-BCI control, with studies reporting positive effects of four individual elements on user performance and experience, namely: feedback, avatars, assistance, and social interaction. Based on these elements, this review makes current and future recommendations for effective gamification, such as the use of virtual reality and adaptation of game difficulty to user skill level."

      "abstract": "Hybrid motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), which integrate both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, outperform those based solely on EEG. However, simultaneously recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules, the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems."

The results show that all individual finger flexion and hand gestures are equally decodable across multiple models and subjects (>98.0\\%). In particular, hand movements, involving index finger flexion, emerged as promising candidates for brain-clicks. When decoding among multiple hand movements, finger flexion appears to outperform hand gestures (96.2\\% and 92.5\\% respectively) and exhibit greater robustness against misclassification errors when all hand movements are included. These findings highlight that optimized classical machine learning models with feature engineering are viable decoder designs for communication-assistive systems."

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance."

Considering the pixel-level misalignment of H&E-IHC image pairs, current research explores the pathological consistency between patches from the same positions of the image pair. However, most of them overemphasize the correspondence between domains or patches, overlooking the side information provided by the non-corresponding objects. In this paper, we propose a Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning (MDCL) method to leverage the supervision information in unpaired H&E-to-IHC stain translation. Specifically, the proposed MDCL method aggregates the inter-domain and intra-domain pathology information by estimating the correlation between the anchor patch and all the patches from the matching images, encouraging the network to learn additional contrastive knowledge from mixed domains. With the mix-domain pathology information aggregation, MDCL enhances the pathological consistency between the corresponding patches and the component discrepancy of the patches from the different positions of the generated IHC image. Extensive experiments on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, namely MIST and BCI, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics."

Among the common procedures of decoding the brain cognitive states with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), extracting the time series of each brain region after brain parcellation traditionally averages across the voxels within a brain region. This neglects the spatial information among the voxels and the requirement of extracting information for the downstream tasks. In this study, we propose to use a fully connected neural network that is jointly trained with the brain decoder to perform an adaptively weighted average across the voxels within each brain region. We perform extensive evaluations by cognitive state decoding, manifold learning, and interpretability analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The performance comparison of the cognitive state decoding presents an accuracy increase of up to 5\\% and stable accuracy improvement under different time window sizes, resampling sizes, and training data sizes. The results of manifold learning show that our method presents a considerable separability among cognitive states and basically excludes subject-specific information. The interpretability analysis shows that our method can identify reasonable brain regions corresponding to each cognitive state. Our study would aid the improvement of the basic pipeline of fMRI processing."

Thus, we investigate the underlying drivers of changes during the resting-state dynamics of the human brain, as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) across varying levels of consciousness (awake, light sedation, deep sedation, and recovery). We deploy a model-based approach relying on linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems under unknown inputs (UI). Our findings reveal distinct changes in the spectral profile of brain dynamics - particularly regarding the stability and frequency of the system's oscillatory modes during transitions between consciousness states. These models further enable us to identify external drivers influencing large-scale brain activity during naturalistic auditory stimulation. Our findings suggest that these identified inputs delineate how stimulus-induced co-activity propagation differs across consciousness states. Notably, our approach showcases the effectiveness of LTI models under UI in capturing large-scale brain dynamic changes and drivers in complex paradigms, such as naturalistic stimulation, which are not conducive to conventional general linear model analysis. Importantly, our findings shed light on how brain-wide dynamics and drivers evolve as the brain transitions towards conscious states, holding promise for developing more accurate biomarkers of consciousness recovery in disorders of consciousness."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.",

We develop BAyesian Structured Mediation analysis with Unobserved confounders (BASMU) framework, and establish its model identifiability conditions. Theoretical analysis is conducted on the asymptotic bias of the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) and the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) when the unobserved confounders are omitted in mediation analysis.

Extensive simulations demonstrate that BASMU substantially reduces the bias in various scenarios. We apply BASMU to the analysis of fMRI data in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, focusing on four brain regions previously reported to exhibit meaningful mediation effects.

      "abstract": "Background: Deep learning models have shown promise in diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) like ASD and ADHD. However, many models either use graph neural networks (GNN) to construct single-level brain functional networks (BFNs) or employ spatial convolution filtering for local information extraction from rs-fMRI data, often neglecting high-order features crucial for NDD classification. Methods: We introduce a Multi-view High-order Network (MHNet) to capture hierarchical and high-order features from multi-view BFNs derived from rs-fMRI data for NDD prediction. MHNet has two branches: the Euclidean Space Features Extraction (ESFE) module and the Non-Euclidean Space Features Extraction (Non-ESFE) module, followed by a Feature Fusion-based Classification (FFC) module for NDD identification. ESFE includes a Functional Connectivity Generation (FCG) module and a High-order Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) module to extract local and high-order features from BFNs in Euclidean space. Non-ESFE comprises a Generic Internet-like Brain Hierarchical Network Generation (G-IBHN-G) module and a High-order Graph Neural Network (HGNN) module to capture topological and high-order features in non-Euclidean space. Results: Experiments on three public datasets show that MHNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods using both AAL1 and Brainnetome Atlas templates. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of MHNet and the effectiveness of using multi-view fMRI information and high-order features. Our study also offers atlas options for constructing more sophisticated hierarchical networks and explains the association between key brain regions and NDD. Conclusion: MHNet leverages multi-view feature learning from both Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces, incorporating high-order information from BFNs to enhance NDD classification performance.",

      "abstract": "Task-specific functional MRI (fMRI) images provide excellent modalities for studying the neuronal basis of cognitive processes. We use fMRI data to formulate and solve the problem of deconvolving task-specific aggregate neuronal networks into a set of basic building blocks called canonical networks, to use these networks for functional characterization, and to characterize the physiological basis of these responses by mapping them to regions of the brain. Our results show excellent task-specificity of canonical networks, i.e., the expression of a small number of canonical networks can be used to accurately predict tasks; generalizability across cohorts, i.e., canonical networks are conserved across diverse populations, studies, and acquisition protocols; and that canonical networks have strong anatomical and physiological basis. From a methods perspective, the problem of identifying these canonical networks poses challenges rooted in the high dimensionality, small sample size, acquisition variability, and noise. Our deconvolution technique is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) that identifies canonical networks as factors of a suitably constructed matrix. We demonstrate that our method scales to large datasets, yields stable and accurate factors, and is robust to noise."

Understanding those dynamic changes and the neuronal networks involved is critical for understanding how the brain functions in health and disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a prevalent neuroimaging technique for studying these complex interactions. However, analyzing fMRI data poses several challenges. Furthermore, most approaches for analyzing Functional Connectivity (FC) still rely on preprocessing or conventional methods, often built upon oversimplified assumptions. On top of that, those approaches often ignore frequency-related information despite evidence showing that fMRI data contain rich information that spans multiple timescales. This study introduces a novel methodology, Multiscale Functional Connectivity (MFC), to analyze fMRI data by decomposing the fMRI into their intrinsic modes, allowing us to separate the neurophysiological activation patterns at multiple timescales while separating them from other interfering components. Additionally, the proposed approach accounts for the natural nonlinear and nonstationary nature of fMRI and the particularities of each individual in a data-driven way. We evaluated the performance of our proposed methodology using three fMRI experiments. Our results demonstrate that our novel approach effectively separates the fMRI data into different timescales while identifying highly reliable functional connectivity patterns across individuals. In addition, we further extended our knowledge of how the FC for these three experiments spans among different timescales."

Another practice that goes unchallenged is thresholding weighted FCs to remove spurious connections without justifying the chosen threshold. This paper leverages recent theoretical advances in Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) to formally define and quantify the information-theoretic fitness (e.g., prominence) of a predetermined set of FNs when mapped to individual FCs under different fMRI task conditions. Our framework allows for evaluating any combination of FC granularity, FN partition, and thresholding strategy, thereby optimizing these choices to preserve important topological features of the human brain connectomes.

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure.

Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation.

On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%.

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals.

In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels. We do this using two datasets; the Kaneshiro et al. (2015) dataset and the Gifford et al. (2022) dataset.

Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the \"foundation\" layer, our framework proposes the \"subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the \"surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate \"subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer."

Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\\% for the X3D behavior recognition model.

In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment.",

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

In this study, we introduce a novel approach, DeCode, that utilizes label-derived features for model conditioning to support the decoder in the reconstruction process dynamically, aiming to enhance the efficiency of the training process. DeCode focuses on improving 3D segmentation performance through the incorporation of conditioning embedding with learned numerical representation of 3D-label shape features. Specifically, we develop an approach, where conditioning is applied during the training phase to guide the network toward robust segmentation. When labels are not available during inference, our model infers the necessary conditioning embedding directly from the input data, thanks to a feed-forward network learned during the training phase. This approach is tested using synthetic data and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of teeth. For CBCT, three datasets are used: one publicly available and two in-house. Our results show that DeCode significantly outperforms traditional, unconditioned models in terms of generalization to unseen data, achieving higher accuracy at a reduced computational cost. This work represents the first of its kind to explore conditioning strategies in 3D data segmentation, offering a novel and more efficient method for leveraging annotated data.

      "abstract": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain.   This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs -- some general, others specialized -- to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that -- perhaps surprisingly -- domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups."

      "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution.

A machine learning model predicts the locus of a landmark as a probability region represented by a heatmap. Diffusion models have increased in popularity for generative modelling due to their high quality sampling and mode coverage, leading to their adoption in medical image processing for semantic segmentation. Diffusion modelling can be further adapted to learn a distribution over landmarks. The stochastic nature of diffusion models captures fluctuations in the landmark prediction, which we leverage by blurring into meaningful probability regions. In this paper, we reformulate automatic Anatomical Landmark Detection as a precise generative modelling task, producing a few-hot pixel heatmap. Our method achieves state-of-the-art MRE and comparable SDR performance with existing work."

The OAA augments input data with various image transformations, thereby diversifying the dataset to improve the generalization ability. The RRE enriches feature diversity and introduces perturbations to create varied inputs for different decoders, thereby providing enhanced variability. Moreover, we introduce a sensitive loss to further enhance consistency across different decoders and stabilize the training process.

This paper introduces Bora, the first spatio-temporal diffusion probabilistic model designed for text-guided biomedical video generation. Bora leverages Transformer architecture and is pre-trained on general-purpose video generation tasks. It is fine-tuned through model alignment and instruction tuning using a newly established medical video corpus, which includes paired text-video data from various biomedical fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive annotated biomedical video dataset. Bora is capable of generating high-quality video data across four distinct biomedical domains, adhering to medical expert standards and demonstrating consistency and diversity. This generalist video generative model holds significant potential for enhancing medical consultation and decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, Bora could pave the way for immersive medical training and procedure planning.

This study introduces Softmax for Arbitrary Label Trees (SALT), a novel approach designed to leverage the hierarchical relationships between labels, improving the efficiency and interpretability of the segmentations.   This study introduces a novel segmentation technique for CT imaging, which leverages conditional probabilities to map the hierarchical structure of anatomical landmarks, such as the spine's division into lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions and further into individual vertebrae. The model was developed using the SAROS dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), comprising 900 body region segmentations from 883 patients. The dataset was further enhanced by generating additional segmentations with the TotalSegmentator, for a total of 113 labels. The model was trained on 600 scans, while validation and testing were conducted on 150 CT scans. Performance was assessed using the Dice score across various datasets, including SAROS, CT-ORG, FLARE22, LCTSC, LUNA16, and WORD.   Among the evaluated datasets, SALT achieved its best results on the LUNA16 and SAROS datasets, with Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.929 respectively. The model demonstrated reliable accuracy across other datasets, scoring 0.891 on CT-ORG and 0.849 on FLARE22. The LCTSC dataset showed a score of 0.908 and the WORD dataset also showed good performance with a score of 0.844.   SALT used the hierarchical structures inherent in the human body to achieve whole-body segmentations with an average of 35 seconds for 100 slices. This rapid processing underscores its potential for integration into clinical workflows, facilitating the automatic and efficient computation of full-body segmentations with each CT scan, thus enhancing diagnostic processes and patient care."
