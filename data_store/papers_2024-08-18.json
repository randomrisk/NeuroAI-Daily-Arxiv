      "abstract": "The stability of complex networks, from power grids to biological systems, is crucial for their proper functioning. It is thus important to control such systems to maintain or restore their stability. Traditional approaches rely on real-time state measurements for feedback control, but this can be challenging in many real-world systems, such as the brain, due to their complex and dynamic nature. This paper utilizes vibrational control -- an open-loop strategy -- to regulate network stability. Unlike conventional methods targeting network nodes, our approach focuses on manipulating network edges through vibrational inputs. We establish sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for vibration-induced functional modifications of network edges and stabilization of network systems as a whole. Additionally, we provide methods for designing effective vibrational control inputs and validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations."

      "abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted to perform anomaly detection in brain MRI. While most existing works try to improve detection accuracy by proposing new model structures or algorithms, we tackle the problem through image quality assessment, an underexplored perspective in the field. We propose a fusion quality loss function that combines Structural Similarity Index Measure loss with l1 loss, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a data pre-processing strategy that enhances the average intensity ratio (AIR) between normal and abnormal regions, further improving the distinction of anomalies. By fusing the aforementioned two methods, we devise the image quality assessment (IQA) approach. The proposed IQA approach achieves significant improvements (>10%) in terms of Dice coefficient (DICE) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) on the BraTS21 (T2, FLAIR) and MSULB datasets when compared with state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the importance of invoking the comprehensive image quality assessment in medical anomaly detection and provide a new perspective for future research in this field.",

      "abstract": "Symmetric second-order tensors are fundamental in various scientific and engineering domains, as they can represent properties such as material stresses or diffusion processes in brain tissue. In recent years, several approaches have been introduced and improved to analyze these fields using topological features, such as degenerate tensor locations, i.e., the tensor has repeated eigenvalues, or normal surfaces. Traditionally, the identification of such features has been limited to single tensor fields. However, it has become common to create ensembles to account for uncertainties and variability in simulations and measurements. In this work, we explore novel methods for describing and visualizing degenerate tensor locations in 3D symmetric second-order tensor field ensembles. We base our considerations on the tensor mode and analyze its practicality in characterizing the uncertainty of degenerate tensor locations before proposing a variety of visualization strategies to effectively communicate degenerate tensor information. We demonstrate our techniques for synthetic and simulation data sets. The results indicate that the interplay of different descriptions for uncertainty can effectively convey information on degenerate tensor locations."

Current approaches to analyze these experiments involve clustering or low-dimensional projections. Here we use the principle of maximum entropy to obtain a probabilistic description that captures the observed presence or absence of mRNAs from hundreds of genes in cells from the mammalian brain. We construct the Ising model compatible with experimental means and pairwise correlations, and validate it by showing that it gives good predictions for higher-order statistics. We notice that the probability distribution of cell states has many local maxima. By labeling cell states according to the associated maximum, we obtain a cell classification that agrees well with previous results that use traditional clustering techniques. Our results provide quantitative descriptions of gene expression statistics and interpretable criteria for defining cell classes, supporting the hypothesis that cell classes emerge from the collective interaction of gene expression levels."

This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role."

      "abstract": "The extremely limited working memory span, typically around four items, contrasts sharply with our everyday experience of processing much larger streams of sensory information concurrently. This disparity suggests that working memory can organize information into compact representations such as chunks, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model for chunking within the framework of the synaptic theory of working memory. We showed that by selectively suppressing groups of stimuli, the network can maintain and retrieve the stimuli in chunks, hence exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding the on-the-fly organization of information in the brain that is crucial for cognition."

This suggests to employ macroscopic thermodynamics methods to understand its properties. The pulse length is several orders of magnitude larger than the synaptic gap, larger than the distance of the nodes of Ranvier, and even larger than the size of many neurons such as pyramidal cells or brain stem motor neurons. Here, we review the mechanical changes in nerves, theoretical possibilities to explain them, and implications of a mechanical nerve pulse for the neuron and for the brain. In particular, the contraction of nerves gives rise to the possibility of fast mechanical synapses."

CSNNs present a promising alternative to traditional power-intensive and complex machine learning methods like backpropagation, offering energy-efficient spiking neuron processing inspired by the human brain. The proposed combined learning method integrates Pair-based Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (PSTDP) and power law-dependent Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to adjust synaptic efficacies, enabling the utilization of stochastic elements like memristive devices to enhance energy efficiency and improve perceptual computing accuracy. By reducing learning parameters while maintaining accuracy, these systems consume less energy and have reduced area overhead, making them more suitable for hardware implementation. The research delves into neuromorphic design architectures, focusing on CSNNs to provide a general framework for energy-efficient computing hardware. Various CSNN architectures are evaluated to assess how less trainable parameters can maintain acceptable accuracy in perceptual computing systems, positioning them as viable candidates for neuromorphic architecture. Comparisons with previous work validate the achievements and methodology of the proposed architecture."

Recent advances in metric learning-based EEG visual decoding methods have delivered promising results and demonstrated the feasibility of decoding novel visual categories from brain activity.

To further explore the semantic consistency between visual and neural signals.

Specifically, a cross-modal information decoupling module is introduced to guide the extraction of semantic-related information from modalities. Then, by quantifying the mutual information between visual image and EEG features, we observe a strong positive correlation between the decoding performance and the magnitude of mutual information. Furthermore, inspired by the mechanisms of visual object understanding from neuroscience, we propose an intra-class geometric consistency approach during the alignment process. This strategy maps visual samples within the same class to consistent neural patterns, which further enhances the robustness and the performance of EEG visual decoding. Experiments on a large Image-EEG dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot neural decoding tasks."

In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis."

Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data."

The gradient boosting parameters are fine-tuned using random search cross-validation (randomsearchCV), achieving an accuracy of 82.35% for neonatal sleep-wake classification.

However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets.

Although recent efforts have focused on using electroencephalography to detect drowsiness, helping prevent accidents caused by driving in such states, seamless human-machine interaction in driving scenarios requires a more versatile EEG-based system. This system should be capable of understanding a driver's intention while demonstrating resilience to artifacts induced by sudden movements. This paper pioneers a novel research direction in BCI-assisted driving, studying the neural patterns related to driving intentions and presenting a novel method for driving intention prediction. In particular, our preliminary analysis of the EEG signal using independent component analysis suggests a close relation between the intention of driving maneuvers and the neural activities in central-frontal and parietal areas. Power spectral density analysis at a group level also reveals a notable distinction among various driving intentions in the frequency domain. To exploit these brain dynamics, we propose a novel Masked EEG Modeling framework for predicting human driving intentions, including the intention for left turning, right turning, and straight proceeding. Extensive experiments, encompassing comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments on public dataset, demonstrate the proposed method is proficient in predicting driving intentions across various vigilance states. Specifically, our model attains an accuracy of 85.19% when predicting driving intentions for drowsy subjects, which shows its promising potential for mitigating traffic accidents related to drowsy driving. Notably, our method maintains over 75% accuracy when more than half of the channels are missing or corrupted, underscoring its adaptability in real-life driving."

      "abstract": "Decoding linguistic information from non-invasive brain signals using EEG has gained increasing research attention due to its vast applicational potential. Recently, a number of works have adopted a generative-based framework to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into sentences by utilizing the power generative capacity of pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, this approach has several drawbacks that hinder the further development of linguistic applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Specifically, the ability of the EEG encoder to learn semantic information from EEG data remains questionable, and the LLM decoder's tendency to generate sentences based on its training memory can be hard to avoid. These issues necessitate a novel approach for converting EEG signals into sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step pipeline that addresses these limitations and enhances the validity of linguistic EEG decoding research. We first confirm that word-level semantic information can be learned from EEG data recorded during natural reading by training a Conformer encoder via a masked contrastive objective for word-level classification. To achieve sentence decoding results, we employ a training-free retrieval method to retrieve sentences based on the predictions from the EEG encoder. Extensive experiments and ablation studies were conducted in this paper for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach. Visualization of the top prediction candidates reveals that our model effectively groups EEG segments into semantic categories with similar meanings, thereby validating its ability to learn patterns from unspoken EEG recordings. Despite the exploratory nature of this work, these results suggest that our method holds promise for providing more reliable solutions for converting EEG signals into text."

This paper contributes to the emerging field of context-based emotion recognition by leveraging psychological theories of human emotion perception to inform the design of automated methods. We propose an approach that combines emotion recognition methods with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) to integrate emotion inferences from decontextualized facial expressions and contextual knowledge inferred via Large-language Models. We test this approach in the context of interpreting facial expressions during a social task, the prisoner's dilemma. Our results provide clear support for BCI across a range of automatic emotion recognition methods. The best automated method achieved results comparable to human observers, suggesting the potential for this approach to advance the field of affective computing."

While the search for suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last two decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same pace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads. In addition, the full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment."

QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise.

Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR."

      "abstract": "Over recent decades, neuroimaging tools, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), have revolutionized our understanding of the brain and its functions. EEG is extensively used in traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and high temporal resolution. This makes it invaluable for identifying different brain states relevant to both medical and non-medical applications. Although this practice is widely recognized, current methods are mainly confined to lab or clinical environments because they rely on data from multiple EEG electrodes covering the entire head. Nonetheless, a significant advancement for these applications would be their adaptation for \"real-world\" use, using portable devices with a single-channel. In this study, we tackle this challenge through two distinct strategies: the first approach involves training models with data from multiple channels and then testing new trials on data from a single channel individually. The second method focuses on training with data from a single channel and then testing the performances of the models on data from all the other channels individually. To efficiently classify cognitive tasks from EEG data, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with only a few parameters and fast learnable spectral-temporal features. We demonstrated the feasibility of these approaches on EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks from three datasets. We achieved the highest accuracies of 100%, 91.55% and 73.45% in binary and 3-class classification on specific channels across three datasets. This study can contribute to the development of single-channel BCI and provides a robust EEG biomarker for brain states classification."

Nevertheless, the continuous generation of brain signals in BCI frameworks poses challenges for efficient storage and real-time transmission. While considering the human brain as a semantic source, the meaningful information associated with cognitive activities often gets obscured by substantial noise present in acquired brain signals, resulting in abundant redundancy. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal brain-computer semantic communication paradigm, named EidetiCom, for decoding visual perception under limited-bandwidth constraint. The framework consists of three hierarchical layers, each responsible for compressing the semantic information of brain signals into representative features. These low-dimensional compact features are transmitted and converted into semantically meaningful representations at the receiver side, serving three distinct tasks for decoding visual perception: brain signal-based visual classification, brain-to-caption translation, and brain-to-image generation, in a scalable manner. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm facilitates the semantic communication under low bit rate conditions ranging from 0.017 to 0.192 bits-per-sample, achieving high-quality semantic reconstruction and highlighting its potential for efficient storage and real-time communication of brain recordings in BCI applications, such as eidetic memory storage and assistive communication for patients."

Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \\textbf{S}hort-\\textbf{T}erm \\textbf{I}nvariance using \\textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role."

AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairments that are related to alterations in brain functional connectivity (FC). Based on this association, many studies have been published over the decades using FC and machine learning to differentiate AD from healthy aging. The most recent development in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network (GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack of spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI. The proposed multi-level generated connectome (MLC) based graph convolutional network (GCN) (MLC-GCN) contains a multi-graph generation block and a GCN prediction block. The multi-graph generation block consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature extraction layers for extracting spatio-temporal rsfMRI features at different depths and building the corresponding connectomes. The GCN prediction block takes the learned multi-level connectomes to build and optimize GCNs at each level and concatenates the learned graphical features as the final predicting features for AD classification. Through independent cohort validations, MLC-GCN shows better performance for differentiating MCI, AD, and normal aging than state-of-art GCN and rsfMRI based AD classifiers. The proposed MLC-GCN also showed high explainability in terms of learning clinically reasonable connectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets. While we only tested MLC-GCN on AD, the basic rsfMRI-based multi-level learned GCN based outcome prediction strategy is valid for other diseases or clinical outcomes."

In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes.

The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features.

However, these approaches with unsupervised node partitions predict outcomes inefficiently with independently established connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the Supervised Brain Parcellation (SBP), a brain node parcellation scheme informed by the downstream predictive task. With voxel-level functional time courses generated under resting-state or cognitive tasks as input, our approach clusters voxels into nodes in a manner that maximizes the correlation between inter-node connections and the behavioral outcome, while also accommodating intra-node homogeneity. We rigorously evaluate the SBP approach using resting-state and task-based fMRI data from both the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our analyses show that SBP significantly improves out-of-sample connectome-based predictive performance compared to conventional step-wise methods under various brain atlases.

Here, we propose the utility of an existing metric quantifying the lack/presence of structure in a signal called, \"deviation from stochasticity\" (DS) measure to characterize resting-state fMRI time series. The hypothesis is that differences in the level of structure in the time series can lead to discrimination between the subject groups. In this work, an autoencoder-based model is utilized to learn efficient representations of data by training the network to reconstruct its input data. The proposed methodology is applied on fMRI time series of 50 healthy individuals and 50 subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), obtained from publicly available ADNI database. DS measure for healthy fMRI as expected turns out to be different compared to that of AD. Peak classification accuracy of 95% was obtained using Gradient Boosting classifier, using the DS measure applied on 100 subjects."

They identify changes in brain activity at various Alzheimer stages, including preclinical and prodromal phases. MEG may detect pathological changes before clinical symptoms, offering potential biomarkers for intervention. This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal."

      "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering."

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.",

Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation.

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI.

We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

As each area is prominent within its respective field, more firmly connecting these areas could prove useful in the dialogue between neuroscience and machine learning. After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

      "abstract": "Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

      "abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted to perform anomaly detection in brain MRI. While most existing works try to improve detection accuracy by proposing new model structures or algorithms, we tackle the problem through image quality assessment, an underexplored perspective in the field. We propose a fusion quality loss function that combines Structural Similarity Index Measure loss with l1 loss, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a data pre-processing strategy that enhances the average intensity ratio (AIR) between normal and abnormal regions, further improving the distinction of anomalies. By fusing the aforementioned two methods, we devise the image quality assessment (IQA) approach. The proposed IQA approach achieves significant improvements (>10%) in terms of Dice coefficient (DICE) and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) on the BraTS21 (T2, FLAIR) and MSULB datasets when compared with state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the importance of invoking the comprehensive image quality assessment in medical anomaly detection and provide a new perspective for future research in this field.",

However, there are currently no generative pre-training methods related to selective state space models (Mamba) that can handle long-range dependencies effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce a generative self-supervised learning method for Mamba (MambaMIM) based on Selective Structure State Space Sequence Token-interpolation (S6T), a general-purpose pre-training method for arbitrary Mamba architectures. Our method, MambaMIM, incorporates a bottom-up 3D hybrid masking strategy in the encoder to maintain masking consistency across different architectures. Additionally, S6T is employed to learn causal relationships between the masked sequence in the state space. MambaMIM can be used on any single or hybrid Mamba architectures to enhance the Mamba long-range representation capability. Extensive downstream experiments reveal the feasibility and advancement of using Mamba for pre-training medical image tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/FengheTan9/MambaMIM",

      "abstract": "Data scarcity is a major limiting factor for applying modern machine learning techniques to clinical tasks. Although sufficient data exists for some well-studied medical tasks, there remains a long tail of clinically relevant tasks with poor data availability. Recently, numerous foundation models have demonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners. However, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical image analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited data. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16 pretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our results indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical data, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very large CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more training samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class. Our findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models specifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more datasets to train these models."

      "abstract": "Segmenting multiple objects (e.g., organs) in medical images often requires an understanding of their topology, which simultaneously quantifies the shape of the objects and their positions relative to each other. This understanding is important for segmentation networks to generalize better with limited training data, which is common in medical image analysis. However, many popular networks were trained to optimize only pixel-wise performance, ignoring the topological correctness of the segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a new topology-aware loss function, which we call PI-Att, that explicitly forces the network to minimize the topological dissimilarity between the ground truth and prediction maps. We quantify the topology of each map by the persistence image representation, for the first time in the context of a segmentation network loss. Besides, we propose a new mechanism to adaptively calculate the persistence image at the end of each epoch based on the network's performance. This adaptive calculation enables the network to learn topology outline in the first epochs, and then topology details towards the end of training. The effectiveness of the proposed PI-Att loss is demonstrated on two different datasets for aorta and great vessel segmentation in computed tomography images."

Meanwhile, current general-domain multimodal models for videos still lack the capabilities to understand and engage in conversations about surgical videos. One major contributing factor is the absence of datasets in the surgical field. In this paper, we create a new dataset, Surg-QA, consisting of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, the largest of its kind so far. To build such a dataset, we propose a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline with LLM to learn surgical knowledge in a structured manner from the publicly available surgical lecture videos. The pipeline breaks down the generation process into two stages to significantly reduce the task complexity, allowing us to use a more affordable, locally deployed open-source LLM than the premium paid LLM services. It also mitigates the risk of LLM hallucinations during question-answer generation, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. We further train LLaVA-Surg, a novel vision-language conversational assistant capable of answering open-ended questions about surgical videos, on this Surg-QA dataset, and conduct comprehensive evaluations on zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks. We show that LLaVA-Surg significantly outperforms all previous general-domain models, demonstrating exceptional multimodal conversational skills in answering open-ended questions about surgical videos. We will release our code, model, and the instruction-tuning dataset."

Human-inspired learning strategies, such as curriculum learning, offer possibilities for efficient training by organising data according to common human learning practices. Despite evidence that fine-tuning with curriculum learning improves the performance of LLMs for natural language understanding tasks, its effectiveness is typically assessed using a single model. In this work, we extend previous research by evaluating both curriculum-based and non-curriculum-based learning strategies across multiple LLMs, using human-defined and automated data labels for medical question answering. Our results indicate a moderate impact of using human-inspired learning strategies for fine-tuning LLMs, with maximum accuracy gains of 1.77% per model and 1.81% per dataset. Crucially, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of these strategies varies significantly across different model-dataset combinations, emphasising that the benefits of a specific human-inspired strategy for fine-tuning LLMs do not generalise. Additionally, we find evidence that curriculum learning using LLM-defined question difficulty outperforms human-defined difficulty, highlighting the potential of using model-generated measures for optimal curriculum design.",

In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with university students to understand the unique challenges in the mental health medication management process and their coping strategies, particularly examining the role of various technologies in this process. We discovered that due to struggles with self-acceptance and the interdependent relationship between medication, symptoms, schedules, and life changes, the medication management process for students was a highly dynamic journey involving frequent dosage changes. Thus, students adopted flexible strategies of using minimal technology to manage their medication in different situations while maintaining a high degree of autonomy. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for future technologies to seamlessly integrate into their daily lives and assist students in managing their mental health medications."

For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.",
