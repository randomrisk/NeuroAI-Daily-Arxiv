      "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally altered the way we interact with digital systems and have led to the pursuit of LLM powered AI agents to assist in daily workflows. LLMs, whilst powerful and capable of demonstrating some emergent properties, are not logical reasoners and often struggle to perform well at all sub-tasks carried out by an AI agent to plan and execute a workflow. While existing studies tackle this lack of proficiency by generalised pretraining at a huge scale or by specialised fine-tuning for tool use, we assess if a system comprising of a coalition of pretrained LLMs, each exhibiting specialised performance at individual sub-tasks, can match the performance of single model agents. The coalition of models approach showcases its potential for building robustness and reducing the operational costs of these AI agents by leveraging traits exhibited by specific models. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning can be mitigated by considering a coalition of pretrained models and believe that this approach can be applied to other non-agentic systems which utilise LLMs."

      "abstract": "Understanding how brain networks learn and manage multiple tasks simultaneously is of interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. In this regard, a recent research thread in theoretical neuroscience has focused on how recurrent neural network models and their internal dynamics enact multi-task learning. To manage different tasks requires a mechanism to convey information about task identity or context into the model, which from a biological perspective may involve mechanisms of neuromodulation. In this study, we use recurrent network models to probe the distinctions between two forms of contextual modulation of neural dynamics, at the level of neuronal excitability and at the level of synaptic strength. We characterize these mechanisms in terms of their functional outcomes, focusing on their robustness to context ambiguity and, relatedly, their efficiency with respect to packing multiple tasks into finite size networks. We also demonstrate distinction between these mechanisms at the level of the neuronal dynamics they induce. Together, these characterizations indicate complementarity and synergy in how these mechanisms act, potentially over multiple time-scales, toward enhancing robustness of multi-task learning."

While the search for suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last two decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same pace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads. In addition, the full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment."

We perform topological data analysis on the extracted class-related features and obtain a globally explainable manifold, and for each abnormal sample to be segmented, a meaningful normal sample could be effectively generated with the guidance of the rule-based paths designed within the manifold for comparison for identifying the tumor regions.

Our results demonstrate that DA significantly enhances imagery prediction, especially with the Regular Transfer approach. We then conduct a DA-enhanced searchlight analysis using Regular Transfer, followed by permutation-based statistical tests to identify brain regions where imagery decoding is consistently above chance across subjects. Our DA-enhanced searchlight predicts imagery contents in a highly distributed set of brain regions, including the visual cortex and the frontoparietal cortex, thereby outperforming standard cross-domain classification methods.

Timely detection and prognostication of VAP in TBI patients are crucial to improve patient outcomes and alleviate the strain on healthcare resources.   Methods: We implemented six machine learning models using the MIMIC-III database. Our methodology included preprocessing steps, such as feature selection with CatBoost and expert opinion, addressing class imbalance with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and rigorous model tuning through 5-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters. Key models evaluated included SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and AdaBoost. Additionally, we conducted SHAP analysis to determine feature importance and performed an ablation study to assess feature impacts on model performance.   Results: XGBoost outperformed the baseline models and the best existing literature. We used metrics, including AUC, Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, F1 Score, PPV, and NPV. XGBoost demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.940 and an Accuracy of 0.875, which are 23.4% and 23.5% higher than the best results in the existing literature, with an AUC of 0.706 and an Accuracy of 0.640, respectively. This enhanced performance underscores the models' effectiveness in clinical settings.   Conclusions: This study enhances the predictive modeling of VAP in TBI patients, improving early detection and intervention potential. Refined feature selection and advanced ensemble techniques significantly boosted model accuracy and reliability, offering promising directions for future clinical applications and medical diagnostics research."

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a severe condition caused by the blockage of brain blood vessels, and can lead to the death of brain tissue due to oxygen deprivation. Thrombectomy has become a common treatment choice for ischemic stroke due to its immediate effectiveness. But, it carries the risk of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage. Clinically, multiple CT scans within 0-72 hours post-surgery are used to monitor for hemorrhage. However, this approach exposes radiation dose to patients, and may delay the detection of cerebral hemorrhage. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel prediction framework for measuring postoperative cerebral hemorrhage using only the patient's initial CT scan. Specifically, we introduce a dual-task mutual learning framework to takes the initial CT scan as input and simultaneously estimates both the follow-up CT scan and prognostic label to predict the occurrence of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage. Our proposed framework incorporates two attention mechanisms, i.e., self-attention and interactive attention. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus more on high-density areas in the image, which are critical for diagnosis (i.e., potential hemorrhage areas). The interactive attention mechanism further models the dependencies between the interrelated generation and classification tasks, enabling both tasks to perform better than the case when conducted individually. Validated on clinical data, our method can generate follow-up CT scans better than state-of-the-art methods, and achieves an accuracy of 86.37% in predicting follow-up prognostic labels. Thus, our work thus contributes to the timely screening of post-thrombectomy cerebral hemorrhage, and could significantly reform the clinical process of thrombectomy and other similar operations related to stroke."

This helps the latent space to capture meaningful encodings of genes in spatial proximity. We carry out theoretical analysis over a tractable loss function for this purpose and formalize the overall learning objective as a regularized evidence lower bound. Our framework grants compatibility with any variational-inference-based generative models for gene expression modeling.

Our pipeline uses an Ada Boost model for classification on a challenging early stage PD classification task with with only 30 participants (11 PD , 19 Healthy Control). Evaluating 9 brain connectivity metrics we find the best connectivity metric to be different for each arousal state with Phase Lag Index achieving the highest individual classification accuracy of 86\\% on N1 data. Further to this our pipeline using regional signal statistics achieves an accuracy of 78\\%, using brain connectivity only achieves an accuracy of 86\\% whereas combining the two achieves a best accuracy of 91\\%. This best performance is achieved on N1 data using Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency characteristics of the EEG signal. This model also achieves a recall of 80 \\% and precision of 96\\%. Furthermore we find that on data from each arousal state, combining PLI with regional signal statistics improves classification accuracy versus using signal statistics or brain connectivity alone. Thus we conclude that combining brain connectivity statistics with regional EEG statistics is optimal for classifier performance on early stage Parkinson's. Additionally, we find outperformance of N1 EEG for classification of Parkinson's and expect this could be due to disrupted N1 sleep in PD. This should be explored in future work."

While CI research has focused on modeling the cochlear activations in response to low-level acoustic features, we hypothesize that the success of these implants is due in large part to the role of the upstream network in extracting useful features from a degraded signal and learned statistics of language to resolve the signal. In this work, we use the deep neural network (DNN) DeepSpeech2, as a paradigm to investigate how natural input and cochlear implant-based inputs are processed over time. We generate naturalistic and cochlear implant-like inputs from spoken sentences and test the similarity of model performance to human performance on analogous phoneme recognition tests. Our model reproduces error patterns in reaction time and phoneme confusion patterns under noise conditions in normal hearing and CI participant studies. We then use interpretability techniques to determine where and when confusions arise when processing naturalistic and CI-like inputs. We find that dynamics over time in each layer are affected by context as well as input type. Dynamics of all phonemes diverge during confusion and comprehension within the same time window, which is temporally shifted backward in each layer of the network. There is a modulation of this signal during processing of CI which resembles changes in human EEG signals in the auditory stream. This reduction likely relates to the reduction of encoded phoneme identity. These findings suggest that we have a viable model in which to explore the loss of speech-related information in time and that we can use it to find population-level encoding signals to target when optimizing cochlear implant inputs to improve encoding of essential speech-related information and improve perception."

Current EEG-based emotion recognition methods perform well with short segments of EEG data. However, these methods encounter significant challenges in real-life scenarios where emotional states evolve over extended periods. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attentive (DuA) transformer framework for long-term continuous EEG emotion analysis. Unlike segment-based approaches, the DuA transformer processes an entire EEG trial as a whole, identifying emotions at the trial level, referred to as trial-based emotion analysis. This framework is designed to adapt to varying signal lengths, providing a substantial advantage over traditional methods. The DuA transformer incorporates three key modules: the spatial-spectral network module, the temporal network module, and the transfer learning module. The spatial-spectral network module simultaneously captures spatial and spectral information from EEG signals, while the temporal network module detects temporal dependencies within long-term EEG data. The transfer learning module enhances the model's adaptability across different subjects and conditions. We extensively evaluate the DuA transformer using a self-constructed long-term EEG emotion database, along with two benchmark EEG emotion databases. On the basis of the trial-based leave-one-subject-out cross-subject cross-validation protocol, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DuA transformer significantly outperforms existing methods in long-term continuous EEG emotion analysis, with an average enhancement of 5.28%."

VT methods are non-invasive, non-intrusive and offer more information on the field than classical point measurements; they are typically used to reconstruct divergence-free (or source-free) velocity and flow fields. In this paper, we show that VT can also be used for the reconstruction of fields with non-zero divergence. In particular, we study electric fields generated by dipole sources in bounded domains which arise, for example, in electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging. To the best of our knowledge, VT has not previously been used to reconstruct such fields. We explain in detail the theoretical background, the derivation of the electric field inverse problem and the numerical approximation of the line integrals. We show that fields with non-zero divergence can be reconstructed from the longitudinal measurements with the help of two sparsity constraints that are constructed from the transverse measurements and the vector Laplace operator. As a comparison to EEG source imaging, we note that VT does not require mathematical modelling of the sources. By numerical simulations, we show that the pattern of the electric field can be correctly estimated using VT and the location of the source activity can be determined accurately from the reconstructed magnitudes of the field."

While the search for suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last two decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same pace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads. In addition, the full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment."

Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR."

      "abstract": "Over recent decades, neuroimaging tools, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), have revolutionized our understanding of the brain and its functions. EEG is extensively used in traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and high temporal resolution. This makes it invaluable for identifying different brain states relevant to both medical and non-medical applications. Although this practice is widely recognized, current methods are mainly confined to lab or clinical environments because they rely on data from multiple EEG electrodes covering the entire head. Nonetheless, a significant advancement for these applications would be their adaptation for \"real-world\" use, using portable devices with a single-channel. In this study, we tackle this challenge through two distinct strategies: the first approach involves training models with data from multiple channels and then testing new trials on data from a single channel individually. The second method focuses on training with data from a single channel and then testing the performances of the models on data from all the other channels individually. To efficiently classify cognitive tasks from EEG data, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with only a few parameters and fast learnable spectral-temporal features. We demonstrated the feasibility of these approaches on EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks from three datasets. We achieved the highest accuracies of 100%, 91.55% and 73.45% in binary and 3-class classification on specific channels across three datasets. This study can contribute to the development of single-channel BCI and provides a robust EEG biomarker for brain states classification."

Nevertheless, the continuous generation of brain signals in BCI frameworks poses challenges for efficient storage and real-time transmission. While considering the human brain as a semantic source, the meaningful information associated with cognitive activities often gets obscured by substantial noise present in acquired brain signals, resulting in abundant redundancy. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal brain-computer semantic communication paradigm, named EidetiCom, for decoding visual perception under limited-bandwidth constraint. The framework consists of three hierarchical layers, each responsible for compressing the semantic information of brain signals into representative features. These low-dimensional compact features are transmitted and converted into semantically meaningful representations at the receiver side, serving three distinct tasks for decoding visual perception: brain signal-based visual classification, brain-to-caption translation, and brain-to-image generation, in a scalable manner. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm facilitates the semantic communication under low bit rate conditions ranging from 0.017 to 0.192 bits-per-sample, achieving high-quality semantic reconstruction and highlighting its potential for efficient storage and real-time communication of brain recordings in BCI applications, such as eidetic memory storage and assistive communication for patients."

In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part.

In this study, we investigated the interpretability of features derived from brain network lateralization, benchmarking against widely used techniques like power spectrum density (PSD), common spatial pattern (CSP), and Riemannian geometry. We focused on the spatial distribution of the functional connectivity within and between hemispheres during motor imagery tasks, introducing network-based metrics such as integration and segregation. Evaluating these metrics across multiple EEG-based BCI datasets, our findings reveal that network lateralization offers neurophysiological plausible insights, characterized by stronger lateralization in sensorimotor and frontal areas contralateral to imagined movements. While these lateralization features did not outperform CSP and Riemannian geometry in terms of classification accuracy, they demonstrated competitive performance against PSD alone and provided biologically relevant interpretation. This study underscores the potential of brain network lateralization as a new feature to be integrated in motor imagery-based BCIs for enhancing the interpretability of noninvasive applications.",

In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the \"StudyForrest\" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the \"Forrest Gump\" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can provide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation theory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models)."

In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features.

The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC.

However, these approaches with unsupervised node partitions predict outcomes inefficiently with independently established connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the Supervised Brain Parcellation (SBP), a brain node parcellation scheme informed by the downstream predictive task. With voxel-level functional time courses generated under resting-state or cognitive tasks as input, our approach clusters voxels into nodes in a manner that maximizes the correlation between inter-node connections and the behavioral outcome, while also accommodating intra-node homogeneity. We rigorously evaluate the SBP approach using resting-state and task-based fMRI data from both the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our analyses show that SBP significantly improves out-of-sample connectome-based predictive performance compared to conventional step-wise methods under various brain atlases.

FMRI is a cutting-edge medical imaging technology renowned for its high spatial resolution and dynamic temporal information, making it particularly suitable for the neural dynamics of depression research. Methods: To address this gap, our study firstly leveraged fMRI to delineate activated regions associated with positive and negative emotions in healthy individuals, resulting in the creation of positive emotion atlas (PEA) and negative emotion atlas (NEA). Subsequently, we examined neuroimaging changes in depression patients using these atlases and evaluated their diagnostic performance based on machine learning. Results: Our findings demonstrate that the classification accuracy of depressed patients based on PEA and NEA exceeded 0.70, a notable improvement compared to the whole-brain atlases. Furthermore, ALFF analysis unveiled significant differences between depressed patients and healthy controls in eight functional clusters during the NEA, focusing on the left cuneus, cingulate gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. In contrast, the PEA revealed more pronounced differences across fifteen clusters, involving the right fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule. Limitations: Due to the limited sample size and subtypes of depressed patients, the efficacy may need further validation in future. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the complex interplay between emotion modulation and depression, showcasing significant alterations in both PEA and NEA among depression patients.

Despite these successes, most studies to date concern unimodal DNNs, encoding either visual or textual input but not both. Yet, there is growing evidence that human meaning representations integrate linguistic and sensory-motor information. Here we investigate whether the integration of multimodal information operated by current vision-and-language DNN models (VLMs) leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity than those obtained by language-only and vision-only DNNs. We focus on fMRI responses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of either a full sentence or an accompanying picture. Our results reveal that VLM representations correlate more strongly than language- and vision-only DNNs with activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. A comparison between different types of visuo-linguistic architectures shows that recent generative VLMs tend to be less brain-aligned than previous architectures with lower performance on downstream applications. Moreover, through an additional analysis comparing brain vs. behavioural alignment across multiple VLMs, we show that -- with one remarkable exception -- representations that strongly align with behavioural judgments do not correlate highly with brain responses. This indicates that brain similarity does not go hand in hand with behavioural similarity, and vice versa."

      "abstract": "Background and Objective: This article concerns a diffusion-based mathematical model for analyzing blood flow and oxygen transport within the capillaries, emphasizing its significance in understanding the physiological and biochemical dynamics of the cerebrovascular system and brain tissue. The focus of this study is, in particular, on neurovascular coupling and the spatiotemporal aspects of blood flow and oxygen transport in microcirculation. Methods: By adopting a coupled modelling approach that integrates the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with Fick's law and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs), we provide a computational framework for the diffusion-driven transport of deoxygenated and total blood volume fractions (DBV and TBV), essential for understanding blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applications. Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: By integrating spatiotemporal modelling within a realistic head model derived from high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI, we analyze the complex interplay between blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain tissue dynamics. This inclusion of a realistic head model not only enriches the accuracy of our simulations but is also beneficial for understanding the physiological and hemodynamic responses within the human brain."

      "abstract": "Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low-dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in the Poincar\\'e disk model of hyperbolic geometry. Here, we define a local measure of distortion of the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain networks dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from DWI and fMRI scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method identifies more accurately the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormality detection in memory-related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing disease progression."

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.",

Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation.

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%.

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals.

While this approach can be useful in some experimental designs, it presents significant limitations for certain types of analyses, such as identifying the category of an object observed by a subject. In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels. We do this using two datasets; the Kaneshiro et al. (2015) dataset and the Gifford et al. (2022) dataset.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1.

      "abstract": "Neuroscience has long been an essential driver of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

As each area is prominent within its respective field, more firmly connecting these areas could prove useful in the dialogue between neuroscience and machine learning. After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

      "abstract": "Many biological learning systems such as the mushroom body, hippocampus, and cerebellum are built from sparsely connected networks of neurons. For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

Because they purposively recruit participants, these studies are uniquely able to address a lack of historical representation, an issue that has affected many biomedical datasets. In this work, we define representativeness as the similarity to a target population distribution of a set of attributes and our goal is to mirror the U.S. population across distributions of age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Many participatory studies recruit at several institutions, so we introduce a computational approach to adaptively allocate recruitment resources among sites to improve representativeness. In simulated recruitment of 10,000-participant cohorts from medical centers in the STAR Clinical Research Network, we show that our approach yields a more representative cohort than existing baselines. Thus, we highlight the value of computational modeling in guiding recruitment efforts."

      "abstract": "Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) are essential in academia, finance, medical fields, and marketing due to their multimodal information content. Traditional methods for extracting information from VRDs depend on expert knowledge and manual labor, making them costly and inefficient. The advent of deep learning has revolutionized this process, introducing models that leverage multimodal information vision, text, and layout along with pretraining tasks to develop comprehensive document representations. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information extraction from VRDs. In response to the growing demands and rapid developments in Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), this paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning-based VRDU frameworks. We systematically survey and analyze existing methods and benchmark datasets, categorizing them based on adopted strategies and downstream tasks. Furthermore, we compare different techniques used in VRDU models, focusing on feature representation and fusion, model architecture, and pretraining methods, while highlighting their strengths, limitations, and appropriate scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging trends and challenges in VRDU, offering insights into future research directions and practical applications. This survey aims to provide a thorough understanding of VRDU advancements, benefiting both academic and industrial sectors."

As models grow in complexity, vanishing and exploding gradients impede convergence and performance. We propose Z-Score Normalization for Gradient Descent (ZNorm), an innovative technique that adjusts only the gradients to enhance training efficiency and improve model performance. ZNorm normalizes the overall gradients, providing consistent gradient scaling across layers, thereby reducing the risks of vanishing and exploding gradients. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets demonstrate that ZNorm not only accelerates convergence but also enhances performance metrics. ZNorm consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior results using the same computational settings. In medical imaging applications, ZNorm improves tumor prediction and segmentation performances, underscoring its practical utility. These findings highlight ZNorm's potential as a robust and versatile tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of deep neural network training across a wide range of architectures and applications."

This study presents and evaluates GAMBAS, a novel, fast machine learning model for automatic beam angle selection.   Methods: The model extracts a predefined set of anatomical features from a patient's CT and structure contours. Using these features, it identifies the most similar patient from a training database and suggests that patient's beam arrangement. A retrospective study with 19 patients was conducted, comparing this model's suggestions to human planners' choices and randomly selected beam arrangements from the training dataset. An expert treatment planner evaluated the plans on quality (scale 1-5), ranked them, and guessed the method used.   Results: The number of acceptable (score 4 or 5) plans was comparable between human-chosen 17 (89%) and model-selected 16(84%) beam arrangements. The fully automatic treatment planning took between 4 - 7 min (mean 5 min).   Conclusion: The model produces beam arrangements of comparable quality to those chosen by human planners, demonstrating its potential as a fast tool for quality assurance and patient selection, although it is not yet ready for clinical use."

      "abstract": "As a potential non-invasive biomarker for ischaemic stroke, intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) could be used for stroke risk assessment on CT head scans routinely acquired for other reasons (e.g. trauma, confusion). Artificial intelligence methods can support IAC scoring, but they have not yet been developed for clinical imaging. Large heterogeneous clinical CT datasets are necessary for the training of such methods, but they exhibit expected and unexpected data anomalies. Using CTs from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), we propose a pipeline that uses as input non-enhanced CT scans to output regions of interest capturing selected large intracranial arteries for IAC scoring. Our method uses co-registration with templates. We focus on quality control, using information presence along the z-axis of the imaging to group and apply similarity measures (structural similarity index measure) to triage assessment of individual image series. Additionally, we propose superimposing thresholded binary masks of the series to inspect large quantities of data in parallel. We identify and exclude unrecoverable samples and registration failures. In total, our pipeline processes 10,659 CT series, rejecting 4,322 (41%) in the entire process, 1,450 (14% of the total) during quality control, and outputting 6,337 series. Our pipeline enables effective and efficient region of interest localisation for targeted IAC segmentation."

Curves effectively describe anatomical structures and are widely used in medical imaging applications related to cardiovascular, respiratory, and skeletal diseases. Traditional curve detection methods are often task-specific, relying heavily on domain-specific features, limiting their broader applicability. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting non-branching curves, which does not require prior knowledge of the object's orientation, shape, or position. Our method uses neural networks to predict (1) an attraction field, which offers subpixel accuracy, and (2) a closeness map, which limits the region of interest and essentially eliminates outliers far from the desired curve. We tested our curve detector on several clinically relevant tasks with diverse morphologies and achieved impressive subpixel-level accuracy results that surpass existing methods, highlighting its versatility and robustness. Additionally, to support further advancements in this field, we provide our private annotations of aortic centerlines and masks, which can serve as a benchmark for future research.

Timely detection and prognostication of VAP in TBI patients are crucial to improve patient outcomes and alleviate the strain on healthcare resources.   Methods: We implemented six machine learning models using the MIMIC-III database. Our methodology included preprocessing steps, such as feature selection with CatBoost and expert opinion, addressing class imbalance with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and rigorous model tuning through 5-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters. Key models evaluated included SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and AdaBoost. Additionally, we conducted SHAP analysis to determine feature importance and performed an ablation study to assess feature impacts on model performance.   Results: XGBoost outperformed the baseline models and the best existing literature. We used metrics, including AUC, Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, F1 Score, PPV, and NPV. XGBoost demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.940 and an Accuracy of 0.875, which are 23.4% and 23.5% higher than the best results in the existing literature, with an AUC of 0.706 and an Accuracy of 0.640, respectively. This enhanced performance underscores the models' effectiveness in clinical settings.   Conclusions: This study enhances the predictive modeling of VAP in TBI patients, improving early detection and intervention potential. Refined feature selection and advanced ensemble techniques significantly boosted model accuracy and reliability, offering promising directions for future clinical applications and medical diagnostics research."

Currently, LLM outputs often need to be edited and evaluated by a human to ensure both factual accuracy and comprehensibility, and this is true for the above use case. We aim to minimize this step by proposing an agentic workflow with the Reflexion framework, which uses iterative self-reflection to correct outputs from an LLM. This pipeline was tested and compared to zero-shot prompting on 16 randomized radiology reports. In our multi-agent approach, reports had an accuracy rate of 94.94% when looking at verification of ICD-10 codes, compared to zero-shot prompted reports, which had an accuracy rate of 68.23%. Additionally, 81.25% of the final reflected reports required no corrections for accuracy or readability, while only 25% of zero-shot prompted reports met these criteria without needing modifications. These results indicate that our approach presents a feasible method for communicating clinical findings to patients in a quick, efficient and coherent manner whilst also retaining medical accuracy.
