      "abstract": "Semantic segmentation and stereo matching, respectively analogous to the ventral and dorsal streams in our human brain, are two key components of autonomous driving perception systems. Addressing these two tasks with separate networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2 datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in mIoU by over 9%.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular and genetic research have identified a diverse range of brain tumor sub-types, shedding light on differences in their molecular mechanisms, heterogeneity, and origins. The present study performs whole-brain connectome analysis using diffusionweighted images. To achieve this, both graph theory and persistent homology - a prominent approach in topological data analysis are employed in order to quantify changes in the structural connectivity of the wholebrain connectome in subjects with brain tumors. Probabilistic tractography is used to map the number of streamlines connecting 84 distinct brain regions, as delineated by the Desikan-Killiany atlas from FreeSurfer. These streamline mappings form the connectome matrix, on which persistent homology based analysis and graph theoretical analysis are executed to evaluate the discriminatory power between tumor sub-types that include meningioma and glioma. A detailed statistical analysis is conducted on persistent homology-derived topological features and graphical features to identify the brain regions where differences between study groups are statistically significant (p < 0.05). For classification purpose, graph-based local features are utilized, achieving a highest accuracy of 88%. In classifying tumor sub-types, an accuracy of 80% is attained. The findings obtained from this study underscore the potential of persistent homology and graph theoretical analysis of the whole-brain connectome in detecting alterations in structural connectivity patterns specific to different types of brain tumors.",

      "abstract": "Representations from deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven remarkably predictive of neural activity involved in both visual and linguistic processing. Despite these successes, most studies to date concern unimodal DNNs, encoding either visual or textual input but not both. Yet, there is growing evidence that human meaning representations integrate linguistic and sensory-motor information. Here we investigate whether the integration of multimodal information operated by current vision-and-language DNN models (VLMs) leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity than those obtained by language-only and vision-only DNNs. We focus on fMRI responses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of either a full sentence or an accompanying picture. Our results reveal that VLM representations correlate more strongly than language- and vision-only DNNs with activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. A comparison between different types of visuo-linguistic architectures shows that recent generative VLMs tend to be less brain-aligned than previous architectures with lower performance on downstream applications. Moreover, through an additional analysis comparing brain vs. behavioural alignment across multiple VLMs, we show that -- with one remarkable exception -- representations that strongly align with behavioural judgments do not correlate highly with brain responses. This indicates that brain similarity does not go hand in hand with behavioural similarity, and vice versa."

Subsequent to predictive inference on the values of the random field (or spatial surface indexed continuously over time) at arbitrary space-time coordinates, scientific interest often turns to gleaning information regarding zones of rapid spatial-temporal change. We develop Bayesian modeling and inference for directional rates of change along a given surface. These surfaces, which demarcate regions of rapid change, are referred to as ``wombling'' surface boundaries. Existing methods for studying such changes have often been associated with curves and are not easily extendable to surfaces resulting from curves evolving over time. Our current contribution devises a fully model-based inferential framework for analyzing differential behavior in spatiotemporal responses by formalizing the notion of a ``wombling'' surface boundary using conventional multi-linear vector analytic frameworks and geometry followed by posterior predictive computations using triangulated surface approximations. We illustrate our methodology with comprehensive simulation experiments followed by multiple applications in environmental and climate science; pollutant analysis in environmental health; and brain imaging.",

      "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a means to convert neural signals into control signals, providing a potential restoration of movement for people with paralysis. Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease afflicts millions of individuals globally. Emerging as a promising brain rehabilitation therapy for Parkinson's Disease, Closed-loop Deep Brain Stimulation (CL-DBS) aims to alleviate motor symptoms. The CL-DBS system comprises an implanted battery-powered medical device in the chest that sends stimulation signals to the brains of patients. These electrical stimulation signals are delivered to targeted brain regions via electrodes, with the magnitude of stimuli adjustable. However, current CL-DBS systems utilize energy-inefficient approaches, including reinforcement learning, fuzzy interface, and field-programmable gate array (FPGA), among others. These approaches make the traditional CL-DBS system impractical for implanted and wearable medical devices. This research proposes a novel neuromorphic approach that builds upon Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron (LIF) controllers to adjust the magnitude of DBS electric signals according to the various severities of PD patients. Our neuromorphic controllers, on-off LIF controller, and dual LIF controller, successfully reduced the power consumption of CL-DBS systems by 19% and 56%, respectively. Meanwhile, the suppression efficiency increased by 4.7% and 6.77%. Additionally, to address the data scarcity of Parkinson's Disease symptoms, we built Parkinson's Disease datasets that include the raw neural activities from the subthalamic nucleus at beta oscillations, which are typical physiological biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease."

Most methods for extracting brain regions are applied to scans from study participants independently, resulting in wide variability in shape and volume estimates of these regions over time in longitudinal studies. To address this problem, we propose a longitudinal principal manifold estimation method, which seeks to recover smooth, longitudinally meaningful manifold estimates of shapes over time. The proposed approach uses a smoothing spline to smooth over the coefficients of principal manifold embedding functions estimated at each time point. This mitigates the effects of random disturbances to the manifold between time points. Additionally, we propose a novel data augmentation approach to enable principal manifold estimation on self-intersecting manifolds. Simulation studies demonstrate performance improvements over naive applications of principal manifold estimation and principal curve/surface methods. The proposed method improves the estimation of surfaces of hippocampuses and thalamuses using data from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. An analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data from 236 individuals shows the advantages of our proposed methods that leverage regional longitudinal trends for segmentation."

      "abstract": "Humans and many animals show remarkably adaptive behavior and can respond differently to the same input depending on their internal goals. The brain not only represents the intermediate abstractions needed to perform a computation but also actively maintains a representation of the computation itself (task abstraction). Such separation of the computation and its abstraction is associated with faster learning, flexible decision-making, and broad generalization capacity. We investigate if such benefits might extend to neural networks trained with task abstractions. For such benefits to emerge, one needs a task inference mechanism that possesses two crucial abilities: First, the ability to infer abstract task representations when no longer explicitly provided (task inference), and second, manipulate task representations to adapt to novel problems (task recomposition). To tackle this, we cast task inference as an optimization problem from a variational inference perspective and ground our approach in an expectation-maximization framework. We show that gradients backpropagated through a neural network to a task representation layer are an efficient heuristic to infer current task demands, a process we refer to as gradient-based inference (GBI). Further iterative optimization of the task representation layer allows for recomposing abstractions to adapt to novel situations. Using a toy example, a novel image classifier, and a language model, we demonstrate that GBI provides higher learning efficiency and generalization to novel tasks and limits forgetting. Moreover, we show that GBI has unique advantages such as preserving information for uncertainty estimation and detecting out-of-distribution samples."

      "abstract": "In vector tomography (VT), the aim is to reconstruct an unknown multi-dimensional vector field using line integral data. In the case of a 2-dimensional VT, two types of line integral data are usually required. These data correspond to integration of the parallel and perpendicular projection of the vector field along integration lines. VT methods are non-invasive, non-intrusive and offer more information on the field than classical point measurements; they are typically used to reconstruct divergence-free (or source-free) velocity and flow fields. In this paper, we show that VT can also be used for the reconstruction of fields with non-zero divergence. In particular, we study electric fields generated by dipole sources in bounded domains which arise, for example, in electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging. To the best of our knowledge, VT has not previously been used to reconstruct such fields. We explain in detail the theoretical background, the derivation of the electric field inverse problem and the numerical approximation of the line integrals. We show that fields with non-zero divergence can be reconstructed from the longitudinal measurements with the help of two sparsity constraints that are constructed from the transverse measurements and the vector Laplace operator. As a comparison to EEG source imaging, we note that VT does not require mathematical modelling of the sources. By numerical simulations, we show that the pattern of the electric field can be correctly estimated using VT and the location of the source activity can be determined accurately from the reconstructed magnitudes of the field."

Our model features two primary innovations: EEG-SSM temporal and EEG-SSM spectral components. The temporal component is designed to efficiently process EEG sequences of varying lengths, while the spectral component enhances the model by integrating frequency-domain information from EEG signals. The synergy of these components allows EEG-SSM to adeptly manage the complexities of multivariate EEG data, significantly improving accuracy and stability across different temporal resolutions. Demonstrating a remarkable 91.0 percent accuracy in classifying Healthy Control (HC), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) groups, EEG-SSM outperforms existing models on the same dataset. The development of EEG-SSM represents an improvement in the use of state-space models for screening dementia, offering more precise and cost-effective tools for clinical neuroscience."

EEG is extensively used in traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and high temporal resolution. This makes it invaluable for identifying different brain states relevant to both medical and non-medical applications. Although this practice is widely recognized, current methods are mainly confined to lab or clinical environments because they rely on data from multiple EEG electrodes covering the entire head. Nonetheless, a significant advancement for these applications would be their adaptation for \"real-world\" use, using portable devices with a single-channel. In this study, we tackle this challenge through two distinct strategies: the first approach involves training models with data from multiple channels and then testing new trials on data from a single channel individually. The second method focuses on training with data from a single channel and then testing the performances of the models on data from all the other channels individually. To efficiently classify cognitive tasks from EEG data, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with only a few parameters and fast learnable spectral-temporal features. We demonstrated the feasibility of these approaches on EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks from three datasets. We achieved the highest accuracies of 100%, 91.55% and 73.45% in binary and 3-class classification on specific channels across three datasets.

Here, we not only develop a competitive deep learning model for seizure prediction but, more importantly, leverage it to demonstrate a methodology to comprehensively evaluate the predictive performance in the seizure prediction task. For this, we introduce a CNN-Transformer deep learning model to detect preictal spatiotemporal dynamics, alongside a novel Continuous Input-Output Performance Ratio (CIOPR) metric to determine the OPP.

To achieve this, we align neural signals in these image-paired neural datasets to pre-trained vision-language embeddings. Neurobind is the first model that studies different neural modalities interconnectedly and is able to leverage high-resource modality models for various neuroscience tasks. We also showed that by combining information from different neural signal modalities, NeuroBind enhances downstream performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different neural modalities.

While useful for studying topological patterns in functional brain connectivity, the main limitation of these methods is their inability to capture the directional dynamics - which is crucial for understanding effective brain connectivity. We propose the Causality-Based Topological Ranking (CBTR) method, which integrates Causal Inference (CI) to assess effective brain connectivity with Hodge Decomposition (HD) to rank brain regions based on their mutual influence. Our simulations confirm that the CBTR method accurately and consistently identifies hierarchical structures in multivariate time series data. Moreover, this method effectively identifies brain regions showing the most significant interaction changes with other regions during seizures using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. These results provide novel insights into the brain's hierarchical organization and illuminate the impact of seizures on its dynamics."

      "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a means to convert neural signals into control signals, providing a potential restoration of movement for people with paralysis. Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR."

EEG is extensively used in traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and high temporal resolution. This makes it invaluable for identifying different brain states relevant to both medical and non-medical applications. Although this practice is widely recognized, current methods are mainly confined to lab or clinical environments because they rely on data from multiple EEG electrodes covering the entire head. Nonetheless, a significant advancement for these applications would be their adaptation for \"real-world\" use, using portable devices with a single-channel. In this study, we tackle this challenge through two distinct strategies: the first approach involves training models with data from multiple channels and then testing new trials on data from a single channel individually. The second method focuses on training with data from a single channel and then testing the performances of the models on data from all the other channels individually. To efficiently classify cognitive tasks from EEG data, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with only a few parameters and fast learnable spectral-temporal features. We demonstrated the feasibility of these approaches on EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks from three datasets. We achieved the highest accuracies of 100%, 91.55% and 73.45% in binary and 3-class classification on specific channels across three datasets. This study can contribute to the development of single-channel BCI and provides a robust EEG biomarker for brain states classification."

Nevertheless, the continuous generation of brain signals in BCI frameworks poses challenges for efficient storage and real-time transmission. While considering the human brain as a semantic source, the meaningful information associated with cognitive activities often gets obscured by substantial noise present in acquired brain signals, resulting in abundant redundancy. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal brain-computer semantic communication paradigm, named EidetiCom, for decoding visual perception under limited-bandwidth constraint. The framework consists of three hierarchical layers, each responsible for compressing the semantic information of brain signals into representative features. These low-dimensional compact features are transmitted and converted into semantically meaningful representations at the receiver side, serving three distinct tasks for decoding visual perception: brain signal-based visual classification, brain-to-caption translation, and brain-to-image generation, in a scalable manner. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm facilitates the semantic communication under low bit rate conditions ranging from 0.017 to 0.192 bits-per-sample, achieving high-quality semantic reconstruction and highlighting its potential for efficient storage and real-time communication of brain recordings in BCI applications, such as eidetic memory storage and assistive communication for patients."

In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part.

In this study, we investigated the interpretability of features derived from brain network lateralization, benchmarking against widely used techniques like power spectrum density (PSD), common spatial pattern (CSP), and Riemannian geometry. We focused on the spatial distribution of the functional connectivity within and between hemispheres during motor imagery tasks, introducing network-based metrics such as integration and segregation. Evaluating these metrics across multiple EEG-based BCI datasets, our findings reveal that network lateralization offers neurophysiological plausible insights, characterized by stronger lateralization in sensorimotor and frontal areas contralateral to imagined movements. While these lateralization features did not outperform CSP and Riemannian geometry in terms of classification accuracy, they demonstrated competitive performance against PSD alone and provided biologically relevant interpretation. This study underscores the potential of brain network lateralization as a new feature to be integrated in motor imagery-based BCIs for enhancing the interpretability of noninvasive applications.",

However, recordings are typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\\% and a top-10 accuracy of 76\\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the data was limited to the typical amount used in practice ($\\sim$10 hours), the top-1 accuracy dropped to 2.5\\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical realization of EEG-based speech BCIs."

Considering many users struggle with effective control of MI-BCI systems, a more user-centered approach to training might help motivate users and facilitate learning, alleviating inefficiency of the BCI system. With the increase of BCI-controlled games, researchers have suggested using game principles for BCI training, as games are naturally centered on the player. This review identifies and evaluates the application of game design elements to MI-BCI training, a process known as gamification. Through a systematic literature search, we examined how MI-BCI training protocols have been gamified and how specific game elements impacted the training outcomes. We identified 86 studies that employed gamified MI-BCI protocols in the past decade. The prevalence and reported effects of individual game elements on user experience and performance were extracted and synthesized. Results reveal that MI-BCI training protocols are most often gamified by having users move an avatar in a virtual environment that provides visual feedback. Furthermore, in these virtual environments, users were provided with goals that guided their actions. Using gamification, the reviewed protocols allowed users to reach effective MI-BCI control, with studies reporting positive effects of four individual elements on user performance and experience, namely: feedback, avatars, assistance, and social interaction. Based on these elements, this review makes current and future recommendations for effective gamification, such as the use of virtual reality and adaptation of game difficulty to user skill level."

However, simultaneously recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules, the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems."

Despite these successes, most studies to date concern unimodal DNNs, encoding either visual or textual input but not both. Yet, there is growing evidence that human meaning representations integrate linguistic and sensory-motor information. Here we investigate whether the integration of multimodal information operated by current vision-and-language DNN models (VLMs) leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity than those obtained by language-only and vision-only DNNs. We focus on fMRI responses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of either a full sentence or an accompanying picture. Our results reveal that VLM representations correlate more strongly than language- and vision-only DNNs with activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. A comparison between different types of visuo-linguistic architectures shows that recent generative VLMs tend to be less brain-aligned than previous architectures with lower performance on downstream applications. Moreover, through an additional analysis comparing brain vs. behavioural alignment across multiple VLMs, we show that -- with one remarkable exception -- representations that strongly align with behavioural judgments do not correlate highly with brain responses. This indicates that brain similarity does not go hand in hand with behavioural similarity, and vice versa."

Methods: By adopting a coupled modelling approach that integrates the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with Fick's law and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs), we provide a computational framework for the diffusion-driven transport of deoxygenated and total blood volume fractions (DBV and TBV), essential for understanding blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applications. Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: By integrating spatiotemporal modelling within a realistic head model derived from high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI, we analyze the complex interplay between blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain tissue dynamics.

This is a challenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of the statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear scaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first conjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which ordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes the existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range of brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we observe that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature.

Our findings reveal that higher cognitive abilities correspond to better brain scores, with correlations peaking in the middle temporal gyrus. This study highlights the potential of fMRI encoding models and brain scores for detecting early functional changes in NCD patients."

      "abstract": "Brain decoding that classifies cognitive states using the functional fluctuations of the brain can provide insightful information for understanding the brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. Among the common procedures of decoding the brain cognitive states with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), extracting the time series of each brain region after brain parcellation traditionally averages across the voxels within a brain region. This neglects the spatial information among the voxels and the requirement of extracting information for the downstream tasks. In this study, we propose to use a fully connected neural network that is jointly trained with the brain decoder to perform an adaptively weighted average across the voxels within each brain region. We perform extensive evaluations by cognitive state decoding, manifold learning, and interpretability analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The performance comparison of the cognitive state decoding presents an accuracy increase of up to 5\\% and stable accuracy improvement under different time window sizes, resampling sizes, and training data sizes. The results of manifold learning show that our method presents a considerable separability among cognitive states and basically excludes subject-specific information. The interpretability analysis shows that our method can identify reasonable brain regions corresponding to each cognitive state. Our study would aid the improvement of the basic pipeline of fMRI processing."

We propose a multi-atlas deep ensemble network, MADE-for-ASD, that integrates multiple atlases of the brain's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data through a weighted deep ensemble network. Our approach integrates demographic information into the prediction workflow, which enhances ASD diagnosis performance and offers a more holistic perspective on patient profiling. We experiment with the well-known publicly available ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) I dataset, consisting of resting state fMRI data from 17 different laboratories around the globe. Our proposed system achieves 75.20% accuracy on the entire dataset and 96.40% on a specific subset $-$ both surpassing reported ASD diagnosis accuracy in ABIDE I fMRI studies. Specifically, our model improves by 4.4 percentage points over prior works on the same amount of data. The model exhibits a sensitivity of 82.90% and a specificity of 69.70% on the entire dataset, and 91.00% and 99.50%, respectively, on the specific subset. We leverage the F-score to pinpoint the top 10 ROI in ASD diagnosis, such as \\emph{precuneus} and anterior \\emph{cingulate/ventromedial}.

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.",

Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation.

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.",

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.   This study presents a novel approach for translating MEG signals into text using a speech-decoding framework with multiple alignments. Our method is the first to introduce an end-to-end multi-alignment framework for totally unseen text generation directly from MEG signals.

In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels. We do this using two datasets; the Kaneshiro et al. (2015) dataset and the Gifford et al. (2022) dataset.

      "abstract": "Growing interest and investment in the capabilities of foundation models has positioned such systems to impact a wide array of public services. Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question.   First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the \"foundation\" layer, our framework proposes the \"subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the \"surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate \"subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer."

Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the classification of primate behavior from video data, but these studies have been carried out in captivity or from ground-based cameras. To understand group behavior and the self-organization of a collective, the whole troop needs to be seen at a scale where behavior can be seen in relation to the natural environment in which ecological decisions are made. This study presents a novel dataset from drone videos for baboon detection, tracking, and behavior recognition. The baboon detection dataset was created by manually annotating all baboons in drone videos with bounding boxes. A tiling method was subsequently applied to create a pyramid of images at various scales from the original 5.3K resolution images, resulting in approximately 30K images used for baboon detection. The tracking dataset is derived from the detection dataset, where all bounding boxes are assigned the same ID throughout the video. This process resulted in half an hour of very dense tracking data. The behavior recognition dataset was generated by converting tracks into mini-scenes, a video subregion centered on each animal; each mini-scene was manually annotated with 12 distinct behavior types, resulting in over 20 hours of data. Benchmark results show mean average precision (mAP) of 92.62\\% for the YOLOv8-X detection model, multiple object tracking precision (MOTA) of 63.81\\% for the BotSort tracking algorithm, and micro top-1 accuracy of 63.97\\% for the X3D behavior recognition model.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties.

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

However, despite their success, current approaches generally issue predictions using data from a single modality. This stands in stark contrast with clinician decision-making which employs diverse information from multiple sources. While several multimodal machine learning approaches exist, significant challenges in developing multimodal systems remain that are hindering clinical adoption. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal framework, AutoPrognosis-M, that enables the integration of structured clinical (tabular) data and medical imaging using automated machine learning. AutoPrognosis-M incorporates 17 imaging models, including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, and three distinct multimodal fusion strategies. In an illustrative application using a multimodal skin lesion dataset, we highlight the importance of multimodal machine learning and the power of combining multiple fusion strategies using ensemble learning. We have open-sourced our framework as a tool for the community and hope it will accelerate the uptake of multimodal machine learning in healthcare and spur further innovation."

The modeling derivation and corresponding analysis have been addressed in a previous contribution. Building on this foundation, the scope of this study involves investigating a distributed control problem with the goal of optimizing a tracking-type cost functional. This latter aims to minimize the deviation of tumor cell location from desired target configurations while penalizing the costs associated with implementing control measures, akin to introducing a suitable medication. Under appropriate mathematical assumptions, we demonstrate that sufficiently regular solutions exhibit continuous dependence on the control variable. Furthermore, we establish the existence of optimal controls and characterize the first-order necessary optimality conditions through a suitable variational inequality."

This study introduces a new self-supervised pre-training protocol based on diffusion models for landmark detection in x-ray images. Our results show that the proposed self-supervised framework can provide accurate landmark detection with a minimal number of available annotated training images (up to 50), outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training and state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-trainings for three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity."

Our research addresses this issue by implementing Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) training directly on smartphones for accessible X-ray lung segmentation. We confirm the practicality and feasibility of deploying and training these advanced models on five Android devices, improving medical diagnostics accessibility and bridging the tech divide to extend machine learning benefits in medical imaging to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We further enhance this approach with an unsupervised adaptation method using the novel Variance-Weighted Segmentation Loss (VWSL), which efficiently learns from unlabeled data by minimizing the variance from multiple NCA predictions. This strategy notably improves model adaptability and performance across diverse medical imaging contexts without the need for extensive computational resources or labeled datasets, effectively lowering the participation threshold. Our methodology, tested on three multisite X-ray datasets -- Padchest, ChestX-ray8, and MIMIC-III -- demonstrates improvements in segmentation Dice accuracy by 0.7 to 2.8%, compared to the classic Med-NCA. Additionally, in extreme cases where no digital copy is available and images must be captured by a phone from an X-ray lightbox or monitor, VWSL enhances Dice accuracy by 5-20%, demonstrating the method's robustness even with suboptimal image sources."

In this study, we propose CSWin-UNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation method that incorporates the CSWin self-attention mechanism into the UNet to facilitate horizontal and vertical stripes self-attention. This method significantly enhances both computational efficiency and receptive field interactions. Additionally, our innovative decoder utilizes a content-aware reassembly operator that strategically reassembles features, guided by predicted kernels, for precise image resolution restoration. Our extensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets, including synapse multi-organ CT, cardiac MRI, and skin lesions, demonstrate that CSWin-UNet maintains low model complexity while delivering high segmentation accuracy."

To address this issue, we propose LKCell, a high-accuracy and efficient cell segmentation method. Its core insight lies in unleashing the potential of large convolution kernels to achieve computationally efficient large receptive fields. Specifically, (1) We transfer pre-trained large convolution kernel models to the medical domain for the first time, demonstrating their effectiveness in cell segmentation. (2) We analyze the redundancy of previous methods and design a new segmentation decoder based on large convolution kernels. It achieves higher performance while significantly reducing the number of parameters. We evaluate our method on the most challenging benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results (0.5080 mPQ) in cell nuclei instance segmentation with only 21.6% FLOPs compared with the previous leading method.

      "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly-used tools to diagnose cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Although deep learning models have achieved very impressive success in the field of automatic ECG analysis, they often lack model interpretability that is significantly important in the healthcare applications. To this end, many schemes such as general-purpose attention mechanism, Grad-CAM technique and ECG knowledge graph were proposed to be integrated with deep learning models. However, they either result in decreased classification performance or do not consist with the one in cardiologists' mind when interpreting ECG. In this study, we propose a novel disease-specific attention-based deep learning model (DANet) for arrhythmia detection from short ECG recordings. The novel idea is to introduce a soft-coding or hard-coding waveform enhanced module into existing deep neural networks, which amends original ECG signals with the guidance of the rule for diagnosis of a given disease type before being fed into the classification module. For the soft-coding DANet, we also develop a learning framework combining self-supervised pre-training with two-stage supervised training. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed DANet, we applied it to the problem of atrial premature contraction detection and the experimental results shows that it demonstrates superior performance compared to the benchmark model. Moreover, it also provides the waveform regions that deserve special attention in the model's decision-making process, allowing it to be a medical diagnostic assistant for physicians."

Repaired cartilage, after certain surgical procedures, exhibits imaging patterns unseen to pre-training, posing further challenges for using models like SAM with or without general-purpose fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a novel registration-based prompt engineering framework for medical image segmentation using SAM. This approach utilises established image registration algorithms to align the new image (to-be-segmented) and a small number of reference images, without requiring segmentation labels. The spatial transformations generated by registration align either the new image or pre-defined point-based prompts, before using them as input to SAM. This strategy, requiring as few as five reference images with defined point prompts, effectively prompts SAM for inference on new images, without needing any segmentation labels. Evaluation of MR images from patients who received cartilage stem cell therapy yielded Dice scores of 0.89, 0.87, 0.53, and 0.52 for segmenting femur, tibia, femoral- and tibial cartilages, respectively. This outperforms atlas-based label fusion and is comparable to supervised nnUNet, an upper-bound fair baseline in this application, both of which require full segmentation labels for reference samples.

Despite this growth, the impact of surgical computer vision remains limited compared to other medical fields like pathology and radiology, primarily due to the scarcity of representative annotated data. Whereas transfer learning from large annotated datasets such as ImageNet has been conventionally the norm to achieve high-performing models, recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated superior performance. In medical image analysis, in-domain SSL pretraining has already been shown to outperform ImageNet-based initialization. Although unlabeled data in the field of surgical computer vision is abundant, the diversity within this data is limited. This study investigates the role of dataset diversity in SSL for surgical computer vision, comparing procedure-specific datasets against a more heterogeneous general surgical dataset across three different downstream surgical applications. The obtained results show that using solely procedure-specific data can lead to substantial improvements of 13.8%, 9.5%, and 36.8% compared to ImageNet pretraining. However, extending this data with more heterogeneous surgical data further increases performance by an additional 5.0%, 5.2%, and 2.5%, suggesting that increasing diversity within SSL data is beneficial for model performance.

      "abstract": "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model. Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.765 and an AP value of 0.415 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions."
