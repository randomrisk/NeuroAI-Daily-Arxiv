      "abstract": "Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Rongzhao-He/surface-vision-mamba."

      "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making within large and redundant action spaces remains challenging in deep reinforcement learning. Considering similar but ineffective actions at each step can lead to repetitive and unproductive trials. Existing methods attempt to improve agent exploration by reducing or penalizing redundant actions, yet they fail to provide quantitative and reliable evidence to determine redundancy. In this paper, we propose a method to improve exploration efficiency by estimating the causal effects of actions. Unlike prior methods, our approach offers quantitative results regarding the causality of actions for one-step transitions. We first pre-train an inverse dynamics model to serve as prior knowledge of the environment. Subsequently, we classify actions across the entire action space at each time step and estimate the causal effect of each action to suppress redundant actions during exploration. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and present empirical results from simulations in environments with redundant actions to evaluate its performance.

      "abstract": "Reconstructing perceived images from human brain activity forms a crucial link between human and machine learning through Brain-Computer Interfaces. Early methods primarily focused on training separate models for each individual to account for individual variability in brain activity, overlooking valuable cross-subject commonalities. Recent advancements have explored multisubject methods, but these approaches face significant challenges, particularly in data privacy and effectively managing individual variability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce BrainGuard, a privacy-preserving collaborative training framework designed to enhance image reconstruction from multisubject fMRI data while safeguarding individual privacy. BrainGuard employs a collaborative global-local architecture where individual models are trained on each subject's local data and operate in conjunction with a shared global model that captures and leverages cross-subject patterns. This architecture eliminates the need to aggregate fMRI data across subjects, thereby ensuring privacy preservation. To tackle the complexity of fMRI data, BrainGuard integrates a hybrid synchronization strategy, enabling individual models to dynamically incorporate parameters from the global model. By establishing a secure and collaborative training environment, BrainGuard not only protects sensitive brain data but also improves the image reconstructions accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BrainGuard sets a new benchmark in both high-level and low-level metrics, advancing the state-of-the-art in brain decoding through its innovative design.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts framework for MRI image denoising. Each expert is a specialized denoising convolutional neural network fine-tuned to target specific noise characteristics associated with different image regions. Our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art denoising techniques on both synthetic and real-world brain MRI datasets. Furthermore, we show that it generalizes effectively to unseen datasets, highlighting its robustness and adaptability."

      "abstract": "Non-equilibrium dynamics are present in many aspects of our lives, ranging from microscopic physical systems to the functioning of the brain. What characterizes stochastic models of non-equilibrium processes is the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation relations as well as the existence of non-static stable states, or phases. A prototypical example is a dynamical phase characterized by a limit cycle - the order parameter of finite magnitude rotating or oscillating at a fixed frequency. Consequently, birhythmicity, where two stable limit cycles coexist, is a natural extension of the simpler single limit cycle phase. Both the abundance of real systems exhibiting such states as well as their relevance for building our understanding of non-equilibrium phases and phase transitions are strong motivations to build and study models of such behavior. Field theoretic tools can be used to provide insights into either phase and the transition between them. In this work we explore a simple linear model of the single limit cycle phase with phase-amplitude coupling. We demonstrate how such non-equilibrium coupling affects the fluctuation spectrum of the theory. We then extend this model to include a continuous transition to a two-cycle phase. We give various results, such as an appearance of a critical exceptional point, the destruction of the transition, enhancement of noise for the phase and the presence of KPZ dynamics. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate these results with numerics and discuss future directions."

      "abstract": "Multi-modal brain MRI provides essential complementary information for clinical diagnosis. However, acquiring all modalities is often challenging due to time and cost constraints. To address this, various methods have been proposed to generate missing modalities from available ones. Traditional approaches can be broadly categorized into two main types: paired and unpaired methods. While paired methods offer superior performance, obtaining large-scale paired datasets is challenging in real-world scenarios. Conversely, unpaired methods facilitate large-scale data collection but struggle to preserve critical image features, such as tumors. In this paper, we propose Fully Guided Schr\\\"odinger Bridges (FGSB), a novel framework based on Neural Schr\\\"odinger Bridges, to overcome these limitations. FGSB achieves stable, high-quality generation of missing modalities using minimal paired data. Furthermore, when provided with ground truth or a segmentation network for specific regions, FGSB can generate missing modalities while preserving these critical areas with reduced data requirements. Our proposed model consists of two consecutive phases. 1) Generation Phase: Fuses a generated image, a paired reference image, and Gaussian noise, employing iterative refinement to mitigate issues such as mode collapse and improve generation quality 2) Training Phase: Learns the mapping from the generated image to the target modality. Experiments demonstrate that FGSB achieves comparable generation performance to methods trained on large datasets, while using data from only two subjects. Moreover, the utilization of lesion information with FGSB significantly enhances its ability to preserve crucial lesion features."

MG is one of the most common primary brain tumor, with high resistance to therapy and unfavorable prognosis. Here, we develop a mathematical model that describes the application of chemo- and CAR-T cell therapies and the dynamics of sensitive and resistant populations of tumor cells. This model is a five-dimensional dynamical system with impulsive inputs corresponding to clinical administration of chemo- and immunotherapy. We provide a proof of non-negativeness of solutions of the proposed model for non-negative initial data. We demonstrate that if we apply both therapies only once, the trajectories will be attracted to an invariant surface that corresponds to the tumor carrying capacity. On the other hand, if we apply both treatments constantly, we find regions of the parameter where the tumor is eradicated. Moreover, we study applications of different combinations of the above treatments in order to find an optimal combination at the population level. To this aim, we generate a population of $10^{4}$ virtual patients with the model parameters uniformly distributed in the medically relevant ranges and perform \\emph{in silico} trials with different combinations of treatments. We obtain optimal protocols for several different relations of tumor growth rates between sensitive and drug resistant cells. We demonstrate that the tumor growth rate, efficacy of chemotherapy, and tumor immunosuppression are the parameters that mostly impact survival time in \\emph{in silico} trials.

However, architectures based on deep neural networks have started to yield diminishing returns, primarily due to their statistical nature and inability to capture causal structure in the training data. Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption, which is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective.   Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these issues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One approach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items in the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this will help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned representations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos Learning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear chaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks (brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results over just deep learning alone.   To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos learning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results, especially in domains that contain linked data. We propose an approach for this integration to enhance classification, prediction and reinforcement learning. We also propose a set of research questions that need to be investigated in order to make this integration a reality."

Analogously, functional Ward's linkage defines the distance of two clusters as the increased width of the band delimited by the merged clusters. To address the limitations of conventional Ward's linkage in handling outliers and contamination, the proposed linkages focus exclusively on the most central curves by leveraging magnitude-shape outlyingness measures and modified band depth, respectively. Simulations and real-world electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform other competitive approaches, particularly in the presence of various types of outliers and contamination."

Recently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets have emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available annotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the following limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in the hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private datasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of Brain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG foundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a per-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial correlations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required compared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging from 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of publicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations, our models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks, with competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction.

While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews."

      "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising modality for biometric identification. While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).",

      "abstract": "The decoding of continuously spoken speech from neuronal activity has the potential to become an important clinical solution for paralyzed patients. Deep Learning Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have recently successfully mapped neuronal activity to text contents in subjects who attempted to formulate speech. However, only small BCI datasets are available. In contrast, labeled data and pre-trained models for the closely related task of speech recognition from audio are widely available. One such model is Wav2Vec2 which has been trained in a self-supervised fashion to create meaningful representations of speech audio data. In this study, we show that patterns learned by Wav2Vec2 are transferable to brain data. Specifically, we replace its audio feature extractor with an untrained Brain Feature Extractor (BFE) model. We then execute full fine-tuning with pre-trained weights for Wav2Vec2, training ''from scratch'' without pre-trained weights as well as freezing a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 and training only the BFE each for 45 different BFE architectures. Across these experiments, the best run is from full fine-tuning with pre-trained weights, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 18.54\\%, outperforming the best training from scratch run by 20.46\\% and that of frozen Wav2Vec2 training by 15.92\\% percentage points. These results indicate that knowledge transfer from audio speech recognition to brain decoding is possible and significantly improves brain decoding performance for the same architectures.

      "abstract": "Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal EEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness BCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness, as measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall EEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI fosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential to enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews."

      "abstract": "Assistive mobile robots are a transformative technology that helps persons with disabilities regain the ability to move freely. Although autonomous wheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to allow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does not require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users want to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete speed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments. This limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed changes seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this limitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled robotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion intentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better reflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping. The scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered a normative question \"what computation should the robotic agent carry out to optimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?\" Empirical EEG data were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world state distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial Network framework. The ROS framework was established that connected with a Gazebo environment containing a digital twin of an indoor space and a virtual model of a robotic wheelchair. Signal processing and statistical analyses were implemented to identity the most discriminative features in the spatial-spectral-temporal dimensions, which are then used to construct the world model for the robotic agent to interpret user motion intentions as a Bayesian observer."

Despite some advances in recent years, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor-imagery tasks face challenges, such as amplitude and phase variability and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller models and faster inference. In this study, we develop a prototype, called the Lightweight Geometric Learning Brain--Computer Interface (LGL-BCI), which uses our customized geometric deep learning architecture for swift model inference without sacrificing accuracy. LGL-BCI contains an EEG channel selection module via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of a symmetric positive definite matrix, providing adaptiveness among the continuously changing EEG signal. Meanwhile, a built-in lossless transformation helps boost the inference speed. The performance of our solution was evaluated using two real-world EEG devices and two public EEG datasets. LGL-BCI demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an accuracy of 82.54% compared to 62.22% for the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, LGL-BCI uses fewer parameters (64.9K vs. 183.7K), highlighting its computational efficiency. These findings underscore both the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of LGL-BCI, demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of geometric deep learning in motor-imagery brain--computer interface applications."

This study investigates the effectiveness of fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data for classifying rest versus task states in a motor execution paradigm. Using the SMR Hybrid BCI dataset, this work compares unimodal (EEG and fNIRS) classifiers with a multimodal fusion approach. It proposes Motor Execution using Convolutional Additive Self-Attention Mechanisms (MECASA), a novel architecture leveraging convolutional operations and self-attention to capture complex patterns in multimodal data. MECASA, built upon the CAS-ViT architecture, employs a computationally efficient, convolutional-based self-attention module (CASA), a hybrid block design, and a dedicated fusion network to combine features from separate EEG and fNIRS processing streams. Experimental results demonstrate that MECASA consistently outperforms established methods across all modalities (EEG, fNIRS, and fused), with fusion consistently improving accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. fNIRS generally achieved higher accuracy than EEG alone. Ablation studies revealed optimal configurations for MECASA, with embedding dimensions of 64-128 providing the best performance for EEG data and OD128 (upsampled optical density) yielding superior results for fNIRS data.

The proposed model architecture consists of three main parts: EEG module, speech module, and phoneme predictor. The EEG module learns to properly represent EEG signals into EEG embeddings. The speech module generates speech waveforms from the EEG embeddings. The phoneme predictor outputs the decoded phoneme sequences in text modality. Our proposed approach allows users to obtain decoded listened speech from EEG signals in both modalities (speech waveforms and textual phoneme sequences) simultaneously, eliminating the need for a concatenated sequential pipeline for each modality. The proposed approach also outperforms previous methods in both modalities. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.",

This study attempts to address these challenges by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) for EEG data augmentation to improve data quality and applying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, originally successful in electromyography (EMG) tasks, to EEG-based speech decoding. Additionally, we adapt this architecture for word classification tasks. Using the Brennan dataset, which contains EEG recordings of subjects listening to narrated speech, we preprocess the data and evaluate both classification and sequence-to-sequence models for EEG-to-words/sentences tasks. Our experiments show that VAEs have the potential to reconstruct artificial EEG data for augmentation. Meanwhile, our sequence-to-sequence model achieves more promising performance in generating sentences compared to our classification model, though both remain challenging tasks. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on EEG speech perception decoding, with possible extensions to speech production tasks such as silent or imagined speech."

      "abstract": "Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) facilitate high-throughput target image detection by identifying event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked in EEG signals. The RSVP-BCI systems effectively detect single-class targets within a stream of images but have limited applicability in scenarios that require detecting multiple target categories. Multi-class RSVP-BCI systems address this limitation by simultaneously identifying the presence of a target and distinguishing its category. However, existing multi-class RSVP decoding algorithms predominantly rely on single-modality EEG decoding, which restricts their performance improvement due to the high similarity between ERPs evoked by different target categories. In this work, we introduce eye movement (EM) modality into multi-class RSVP decoding and explore EEG and EM fusion to enhance decoding performance. First, we design three independent multi-class target RSVP tasks and build an open-source dataset comprising EEG and EM signals from 43 subjects. Then, we propose the Multi-class Target RSVP EEG and EM fusion Network (MTREE-Net) to enhance multi-class RSVP decoding. Specifically, a dual-complementary module is proposed to strengthen the differentiation of uni-modal features across categories. To improve multi-modal fusion performance, we adopt a dynamic reweighting fusion strategy guided by theoretically derived modality contribution ratios. Furthermore, we reduce the misclassification of non-target samples through knowledge transfer between two hierarchical classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of integrating EM signals into multi-class RSVP decoding and highlight the superior performance of MTREE-Net compared to existing RSVP decoding methods. The proposed MTREE-Net and open-source dataset provide a promising framework for developing practical multi-class RSVP-BCI systems."

Early methods primarily focused on training separate models for each individual to account for individual variability in brain activity, overlooking valuable cross-subject commonalities. Recent advancements have explored multisubject methods, but these approaches face significant challenges, particularly in data privacy and effectively managing individual variability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce BrainGuard, a privacy-preserving collaborative training framework designed to enhance image reconstruction from multisubject fMRI data while safeguarding individual privacy. BrainGuard employs a collaborative global-local architecture where individual models are trained on each subject's local data and operate in conjunction with a shared global model that captures and leverages cross-subject patterns. This architecture eliminates the need to aggregate fMRI data across subjects, thereby ensuring privacy preservation. To tackle the complexity of fMRI data, BrainGuard integrates a hybrid synchronization strategy, enabling individual models to dynamically incorporate parameters from the global model. By establishing a secure and collaborative training environment, BrainGuard not only protects sensitive brain data but also improves the image reconstructions accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BrainGuard sets a new benchmark in both high-level and low-level metrics, advancing the state-of-the-art in brain decoding through its innovative design.",

Biological networks, such as the brain, are known to exhibit group structure at a variety of scales -- local, meso, and global scale. Modularity, while useful in describing mesoscale brain organization, is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure. This approach, while valuable, overlooks important localized variations in community structure at the node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity ($nQ$) captures both meso and local scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that $nQ$ illuminates granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored $nQ$ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. Observed changes in $nQ$ in fMRI and DTI networks aligned with known trajectories of AD and were linked to common biomarkers of the disease, including amyloid-$\\beta$ and tau. Additionally, $nQ$ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters showing indications that $nQ$ may be a useful diagnostic tool for characterizing disease stages. Our findings demonstrate the utility of $nQ$ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into temporal and disease related variability at the node level.

A particularly useful branch of NCT is optimal control, which focuses on applying theoretical and computational principles of control theory to design optimal strategies to achieve specific goals in neural processes. However, most existing research focuses on optimally controlling brain network dynamics from the original state to a target state at a specific time point. In this paper, we present the first investigation of introducing optimal stochastic tracking control strategy to synchronize the dynamics of the brain network to a target dynamics rather than to a target state at a specific time point. We utilized fMRI data from healthy groups, and cases of stroke and post-stroke aphasia. For all participants, we utilized a gradient descent optimization method to estimate the parameters for the brain network dynamic system. We then utilized optimal stochastic tracking control techniques to drive original unhealthy dynamics by controlling a certain number of nodes to synchronize with target healthy dynamics. Results show that the energy associated with optimal stochastic tracking control is negatively correlated with the intrinsic average controllability of the brain network system, while the energy of the optimal state approaching control is significantly related to the target state value. For a 100-dimensional brain network system, controlling the five nodes with the lowest tracking energy can achieve relatively acceptable dynamics control effects. Our results suggest that stochastic tracking control is more aligned with the objective of brain stimulation interventions, and is closely related to the intrinsic characteristics of the brain network system, potentially representing a new direction for future brain network optimal control research."

Traditional analyses that focus solely on pairwise interactions often oversimplify these systems, neglecting the higher-order interactions critical for understanding their full collective dynamics. Recent advances in multivariate information theory provide a principled framework for quantifying these higher-order interactions, capturing key properties such as redundancy, synergy, shared randomness, and collective constraints. However, two major challenges persist: accurately estimating joint entropies and addressing the combinatorial explosion of interacting terms. To overcome these challenges, we introduce THOI (Torch-based High-Order Interactions), a novel, accessible, and efficient Python library for computing high-order interactions in continuous-valued systems. THOI leverages the well-established Gaussian copula method for joint entropy estimation, combined with state-of-the-art batch and parallel processing techniques to optimize performance across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments. Our results demonstrate that THOI significantly outperforms existing tools in terms of speed and scalability. For larger systems, where exhaustive analysis is computationally impractical, THOI integrates optimization strategies that make higher-order interaction analysis feasible. We validate THOI accuracy using synthetic datasets with parametrically controlled interactions and further illustrate its utility by analyzing fMRI data from human subjects in wakeful resting states and under deep anesthesia. Finally, we analyzed over 900 real-world and synthetic datasets, establishing a comprehensive framework for applying higher-order interaction (HOI) analysis in complex systems."

However, the current captioning approach introduces the challenge of potential data contamination given that the GIT model was trained on the COCO dataset. In this work, we present an alternative method for decoding brain signals into image captions by predicting a DINOv2 model's embedding of an image from the corresponding fMRI signal and then providing its [CLS] token as the prefix to the GPT-2 language model which decreases computational requirements considerably. Additionally, instead of commonly used Linear Regression, we explore 3D Convolutional Neural Network mapping of fMRI signals to image embedding space for better accounting positional information of voxels.",

Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships."

MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG."

These issues are prominent in neuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are analyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), where signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's underlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are assumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View Independent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across subjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual variability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a temporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory stimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays alone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to differ across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a model with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in closed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms existing multi-view ICA methods. We further validate its effectiveness using the Cam-CAN dataset, and showing how delays and dilations are related to aging.",

It serves as one of the primary tools for describing the spatial dynamics of the brain using various neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the distribution rules or potential modes of functional connectivity weights in the resting state remain unclear. In this context, we first start from simulation, using forward solving model to generate scalp EEG with four channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128). Subsequently, we construct scalp brain networks using five coupling measures, aiming to explore whether different channel density or coupling measures affect the distribution pattern of functional connectivity weights. Next, we quantify the distribution pattern by calculating the skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy of the functional connectivity network weights. Finally, the results of the simulation were validated in a normative database. We observed that: 1) The functional connection weights exhibit a right-skewed distribution, and are not influenced by channel density or coupling measures; 2) The functional connection weights exhibit a relatively uniform distribution, with the potential for volume conduction to affect the degree of uniformity in the distribution; 3) Networks constructed using coupling measures influenced by volume conduction exhibit significant correlations between the average connection weight and measures of skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of RSNs, providing valuable insights for research in the field of neuroscience, and holds promise for being associated with brain cognition and disease diagnosis."

The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future."

Existing research addresses MEG spike detection by encoding neural network inputs with signals from all channel within a time segment, followed by classification. However, these methods overlook simultaneous spiking occurred from nearby sensors. We introduce a simple yet effective paradigm that first clusters MEG channels based on their sensor's spatial position. Next, a novel convolutional input module is designed to integrate the spatial clustering and temporal changes of the signals.

Recent research has shown predictive signals can be revealed in pre-onset ECoG activity during naturalistic narrative listening, by building encoding models based on word embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs). Similarly, evidence for long-range predictive encoding has been observed in fMRI data, where incorporating embeddings for multiple upcoming words in a narrative improves alignment with brain activity. This study examines whether similar predictive information can be detected in MEG, a technique with higher temporal resolution than fMRI but a lower signal-to-noise ratio than ECoG. Our findings indicate that MEG captures pre-onset representations up to 1 second before word onset, consistent with ECoG results. However, unlike fMRI findings, incorporating future word embeddings did not enhance MEG encoding, even for one word into the future, which suggests that the pre-onset encoding may not reflect predictive processing. This work demonstrates that MEG combined with LLMs is a valuable approach for studying language processing in naturalistic narratives and highlights the need to study further what constitutes evidence for prediction during natural listening."

In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli."

To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior.

In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods.

Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short.

      "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of the ventral visual stream, despite their lack of biological specificity. While current state-of-the-art models of the primary visual cortex (V1) have surfaced from training with adversarial examples and extensively augmented data, these models are still unable to explain key neural properties observed in V1 that arise from biological circuitry. To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

      "abstract": "Recent applications of pattern recognition techniques on brain connectome classification using functional connectivity (FC) are shifting towards acknowledging the non-Euclidean topology and dynamic aspects of brain connectivity across time. In this paper, a deep spatiotemporal variational Bayes (DSVB) framework is proposed to learn time-varying topological structures in dynamic FC networks for identifying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human participants. The framework incorporates a spatial-aware recurrent neural network with an attention-based message passing scheme to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns across dynamic FC networks. To overcome model overfitting on limited training datasets, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to learn graph embedding models that generalize well to unseen brain networks. Evaluation on the ABIDE resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset shows that our proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying patients with ASD. Dynamic FC analyses with DSVB-learned embeddings reveal apparent group differences between ASD and healthy controls in brain network connectivity patterns and switching dynamics of brain states.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

Instead, our methodology mimics the diagnostic process by thoroughly analyzing both normal and pathological features of fundus structures, leaving the ultimate decision-making authority in the hands of healthcare professionals. Our initiative addresses the need for objective clinical analysis and seeks to automate and enhance the clinical workflow of fundus image examination. The system, from its overarching architecture to the modular analysis design powered by artificial intelligence (AI) models, aligns seamlessly with ophthalmological practices. Our unique approach utilizes a combination of state-of-the-art deep learning methods and traditional computer vision algorithms to provide a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of fundus structures. We present a distinctive methodology for designing medical applications, using our system as an illustrative example. Comprehensive verification and validation results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in revolutionizing fundus image analysis, with potential applications across various medical domains."

These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.",

      "abstract": "Automated segmentation plays a pivotal role in medical image analysis and computer-assisted interventions. Despite the promising performance of existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they neglect useful equivariant properties for images, such as rotational and reflection equivariance. This limitation can decrease performance and lead to inconsistent predictions, especially in applications like vessel segmentation where explicit orientation is absent. While existing equivariant learning approaches attempt to mitigate these issues, they substantially increase learning cost, model size, or both. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel application of an efficient symmetric rotation-equivariant (SRE) convolutional (SRE-Conv) kernel implementation to the U-Net architecture, to learn rotation and reflection-equivariant features, while also reducing the model size dramatically. We validate the effectiveness of our method through improved segmentation performance on retina vessel fundus imaging. Our proposed SRE U-Net not only significantly surpasses standard U-Net in handling rotated images, but also outperforms existing equivariant learning methods and does so with a reduced number of trainable parameters and smaller memory cost.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in assisting radiologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image interpretation and diagnosis. However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation. In the zero-shot classification task, we achieved an average AUC of 81.3% on 54 diagnosis tasks, surpassing CLIP and supervised methods by 12.9% and 8.0%, respectively.",

We introduce PARASIDE, an automatic tool for segmenting air and soft tissue volumes of the structures of the sinus maxillaris, frontalis, sphenodalis and ethmoidalis in T1 MRI. By utilizing that segmentation, we can quantify feature relations that have been observed only manually and subjectively before. We performed an exemplary study and showed both volume and intensity relations between structures and radiology reports. While the soft tissue segmentation is good, the automated annotations of the air volumes are excellent. The average intensity over air structures are consistently below those of the soft tissues, close to perfect separability. Healthy subjects exhibit lower soft tissue volumes and lower intensities. Our developed system is the first automated whole nasal segmentation of 16 structures, and capable of calculating medical relevant features such as the Lund-Mackay score."

      "abstract": "Assessing cancer progression in liver CT scans is a clinical challenge, requiring a comparison of scans at different times for the same patient. Practitioners must identify existing tumors, compare them with prior exams, identify new tumors, and evaluate overall disease evolution. This process is particularly complex in liver examinations due to misalignment between exams caused by several factors. Indeed, longitudinal liver examinations can undergo different non-pathological and pathological changes due to non-rigid deformations, the appearance or disappearance of pathologies, and other variations. In such cases, existing registration approaches, mainly based on intrinsic features may distort tumor regions, biasing the tumor progress evaluation step and the corresponding diagnosis. This work proposes a registration method based only on geometrical and anatomical information from liver segmentation, aimed at aligning longitudinal liver images for aided diagnosis. The proposed method is trained and tested on longitudinal liver CT scans, with 317 patients for training and 53 for testing. Our experimental results support our claims by showing that our method is better than other registration techniques by providing a smoother deformation while preserving the tumor burden (total volume of tissues considered as tumor) within the volume. Qualitative results emphasize the importance of smooth deformations in preserving tumor appearance."

The dataset consisted of patients and healthy individuals who read a predefined text using the H1N Zoom microphone in a suitable recording environment at F{\\i}rat University Neurology Department. Speech recordings from PD patients and healthy controls were analyzed, and 19 key features were extracted, including jitter, luminance, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), root mean square (RMS) energy, entropy, skewness, and kurtosis.These features were visualized in graphs and statistically evaluated to identify distinctive patterns in PD patients. Using MATLAB's Classification Learner toolbox, several machine learning classification algorithm models were applied to classify groups and significant accuracy rates were achieved. The accuracy of our 3-layer artificial neural network architecture was also compared with classical machine learning algorithms. This study highlights the potential of noninvasive voice analysis combined with machine learning for early detection and monitoring of PD patients.
