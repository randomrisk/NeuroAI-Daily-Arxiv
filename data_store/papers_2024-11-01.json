      "abstract": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) presents an exciting opportunity to unlock the potential of vast, untapped clinical datasets, for various downstream applications that suffer from the scarcity of labeled data. While SSL has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, their adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by three key pitfalls: Small pre-training dataset sizes, architectures inadequate for 3D medical image analysis, and insufficient evaluation practices. We address these issues by i) leveraging a large-scale dataset of 44k 3D brain MRI volumes and ii) using a Residual Encoder U-Net architecture within the state-of-the-art nnU-Net framework. iii) A robust development framework, incorporating 5 development and 8 testing brain MRI segmentation datasets, allowed performance-driven design decisions to optimize the simple concept of Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) for 3D CNNs. The resulting model not only surpasses previous SSL methods but also outperforms the strong nnU-Net baseline by an average of approximately 3 Dice points. Furthermore, our model demonstrates exceptional stability, achieving the highest average rank of 2 out of 7 methods, compared to the second-best method's mean rank of 3."

      "abstract": "When solving inverse problems, one has to deal with numerous potential sources of model inexactnesses, like object motion, calibration errors, or simplified data models. Regularized Sequential Subspace Optimization (ReSeSOp) allows to compensate for such inaccuracies within the reconstruction step by employing consecutive projections onto suitably defined subspaces. However, this approach relies on a priori estimates for the model inexactness levels which are typically unknown. In dynamic imaging applications, where inaccuracies arise from the unpredictable dynamics of the object, these estimates are particularly challenging to determine in advance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a learned version of ReSeSOp which allows to approximate inexactness levels on the fly. The proposed framework generalizes established unrolled iterative reconstruction schemes to inexact forward operators and is particularly tailored to the structure of dynamic problems. We also present a comprehensive mathematical analysis regarding the effect of dependencies within the forward problem, clarifying when and why dividing the overall problem into subproblems is essential. The proposed method is evaluated on various examples from dynamic imaging, including datasets from a rheological CT experiment, brain MRI, and real-time cardiac MRI. The respective results emphasize improvements in reconstruction quality while ensuring adequate data consistency."

These impairments degrade their quality of life and potentially make software use more challenging for them. However, there has been limited research on designing accessible software for cancer survivors. To bridge this research gap, we conducted a formative study including a survey (n=46), semi-structured interviews (n=20), and a diary study (n=10) with cancer survivors. Our results revealed a wide range of impairments experienced by cancer survivors, including chemo brain, neuropathy, and visual impairments. Cancer survivors heavily relied on software for socialization, health purposes, and cancer advocacy, but their impairments made software use more challenging for them. Based on the results, we offer a set of accessibility guidelines that software designers can utilize when creating applications for cancer survivors. Further, we suggest design features for inclusion, such as health resources, socialization tools, and games, tailored to the needs of cancer survivors. This research aims to spotlight cancer survivors' software accessibility challenges and software needs and invite more research in this important yet under-investigated domain."

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often linked to early neurodegeneration, is characterized by subtle cognitive declines and disruptions in brain connectivity. The present study offers a detailed analysis of topological changes associated with MCI, focusing on two subtypes: Early MCI and Late MCI. This analysis utilizes fMRI time series data from two distinct populations: the publicly available ADNI dataset (Western cohort) and the in-house TLSA dataset (Indian Urban cohort). Persistent Homology, a topological data analysis method, is employed with two distinct filtration techniques - Vietoris-Rips and graph filtration-for classifying MCI subtypes. For Vietoris-Rips filtration, inter-ROI Wasserstein distance matrices between persistent diagrams are used for classification, while graph filtration relies on the top ten most persistent homology features. Comparative analysis shows that the Vietoris-Rips filtration significantly outperforms graph filtration, capturing subtle variations in brain connectivity with greater accuracy. The Vietoris-Rips filtration method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 85.7\\% for distinguishing between age and gender matched healthy controls and MCI, whereas graph filtration reached a maximum accuracy of 71.4\\% for the same task. This superior performance highlights the sensitivity of Vietoris-Rips filtration in detecting intricate topological features associated with neurodegeneration. The findings underscore the potential of persistent homology, particularly when combined with the Wasserstein distance, as a powerful tool for early diagnosis and precise classification of cognitive impairments, offering valuable insights into brain connectivity changes in MCI."

This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of the brain, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this research. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved. In order to evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the features via the following machine learning models: KNN, Logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Perception. CNN and machine learning models were also evaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the CNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the patient."

      "abstract": "Estimated brain age from magnetic resonance image (MRI) and its deviation from chronological age can provide early insights into potential neurodegenerative diseases, supporting early detection and implementation of prevention strategies. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), a widely used modality for brain age estimation, presents an opportunity to build an earlier biomarker for neurodegenerative disease prediction because it captures subtle microstructural changes that precede more perceptible macrostructural changes. However, the coexistence of macro- and micro-structural information in dMRI raises the question of whether current dMRI-based brain age estimation models are leveraging the intended microstructural information or if they inadvertently rely on the macrostructural information. To develop a microstructure-specific brain age, we propose a method for brain age identification from dMRI that minimizes the model's use of macrostructural information by non-rigidly registering all images to a standard template. Imaging data from 13,398 participants across 12 datasets were used for the training and evaluation. We compare our brain age models, trained with and without macrostructural information minimized, with an architecturally similar T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based brain age model and two state-of-the-art T1w MRI-based brain age models that primarily use macrostructural information. We observe difference between our dMRI-based brain age and T1w MRI-based brain age across stages of neurodegeneration, with dMRI-based brain age being older than T1w MRI-based brain age in participants transitioning from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but younger in participants already diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Approximately 4 years before MCI diagnosis, dMRI-based brain age yields better performance than T1w MRI-based brain ages in predicting transition from CN to MCI."

Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.",

We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio.

      "abstract": "Sleep monitoring plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, with sleep staging serving as an essential metric in the monitoring process. Traditional methods, utilizing medical sensors like EEG and ECG, can be effective but often present challenges such as unnatural user experience, complex deployment, and high costs. Ballistocardiography~(BCG), a type of piezoelectric sensor signal, offers a non-invasive, user-friendly, and easily deployable alternative for long-term home monitoring. However, reliable BCG-based sleep staging is challenging due to the limited sleep monitoring data available for BCG. A restricted training dataset prevents the model from generalization across populations. Additionally, transferring to BCG faces difficulty ensuring model robustness when migrating from other data sources. To address these issues, we introduce SleepNetZero, a zero-shot learning based approach for sleep staging. To tackle the generalization challenge, we propose a series of BCG feature extraction methods that align BCG components with corresponding respiratory, cardiac, and movement channels in PSG. This allows models to be trained on large-scale PSG datasets that are diverse in population. For the migration challenge, we employ data augmentation techniques, significantly enhancing generalizability. We conducted extensive training and testing on large datasets~(12393 records from 9637 different subjects), achieving an accuracy of 0.803 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.718. ZeroSleepNet was also deployed in real prototype~(monitoring pads) and tested in actual hospital settings~(265 users), demonstrating an accuracy of 0.697 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.589. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first known reliable BCG-based sleep staging effort and marks a significant step towards in-home health monitoring."

Especially collaborative VR applications where different people can work together are gaining momentum. In this context, human avatars and their representations are a crucial aspect of collaborative VR applications as they represent a digital twin of the end-users and determine how one is perceived in a virtual environment. When it comes to the effect of avatar representation on the end-users of collaborative VR applications, so far mostly questionnaires have been used to assess the quality of avatar representations. A promising alternative to objectively measure the effect of avatar representation is the investigation of inter-brain connections during the usage of a collaborative VR application. However, the combination of immersive VR applications and inter-brain connections has not been fully researched yet. Thus, our work investigates how different human avatar representations (real (RL), full-body (FB), and head-hand (HH)) affect inter-brain connections. For this purpose, we have designed and conducted a hyperscanning study with eight pairs. The main results of our hyperscanning study show that the number of significant sensor pairs was the highest in the RL, medium in the FB, and lowest in the HH condition indicating that an avatar that looks more like a real human enables more significant sensor pairs to appear in an EEG analysis."

In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing 3D objects with color consistency based on EEG signals. The method adopts a two-stage strategy: in the first stage, we train an implicit neural EEG encoder with the capability of perceiving 3D objects, enabling it to capture regional semantic features; in the second stage, based on the latent EEG codes obtained in the first stage, we integrate a diffusion model, neural style loss, and NeRF to implicitly decode the 3D objects.

To address this challenge, we advocate for predictive systems that provide timely alerts to individuals at risk, enabling them to take precautionary actions. Our framework employs advanced DL techniques and uses personalized data from a network of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions.

One intriguing question is whether these word categories can be predicted from EEG responses with the use of machine learning methods. To address this question, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to decode the word categories from Event Related Potential (ERP) in 40 native Italian speakers. 240 neutral, negative and taboo words were used to this aim. Results indicate that the SVM classifier successfully distinguished between the three-word categories, with significant differences in neural activity ascribed to the late positive potential mainly detected in the central-parietal-occipital and anterior right scalp areas in the time windows of 450-649 ms and 650-850 ms. These findings were in line with the established distribution pattern of the late positive potential. Intriguingly, the study also revealed that word categories were still detectable in the regulate condition.

      "abstract": "Carrying conversations in multi-sound environments is one of the more challenging tasks, since the sounds overlap across time and frequency making it difficult to understand a single sound source. One proposed approach to help isolate an attended speech source is through decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) and identifying the attended audio source using statistical or machine learning techniques. However, the limited amount of data in comparison to other machine learning problems and the distributional shift between different EEG recordings emphasizes the need for a self supervised approach that works with limited data to achieve a more robust solution. In this paper, we propose a method based on self supervised learning to minimize the difference between the latent representations of an attended speech signal and the corresponding EEG signal. This network is further finetuned for the auditory attention classification task. We compare our results with previously published methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the validation set."

The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.",

This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification.

This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data. The model's efficacy is demonstrated across three datasets: 12JFPM (89.70% accuracy for 1s with an information transfer rate (ITR) of 149.58), Benchmark (85.81% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 213.99), and eldBETA (76.50% accuracy for 1s with an ITR of 94.63), achieving state-of-the-art results and setting new benchmarks for SSVEP BCI performance."

Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise.

The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants.

Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning."

The present study offers a detailed analysis of topological changes associated with MCI, focusing on two subtypes: Early MCI and Late MCI. This analysis utilizes fMRI time series data from two distinct populations: the publicly available ADNI dataset (Western cohort) and the in-house TLSA dataset (Indian Urban cohort). Persistent Homology, a topological data analysis method, is employed with two distinct filtration techniques - Vietoris-Rips and graph filtration-for classifying MCI subtypes. For Vietoris-Rips filtration, inter-ROI Wasserstein distance matrices between persistent diagrams are used for classification, while graph filtration relies on the top ten most persistent homology features. Comparative analysis shows that the Vietoris-Rips filtration significantly outperforms graph filtration, capturing subtle variations in brain connectivity with greater accuracy. The Vietoris-Rips filtration method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 85.7\\% for distinguishing between age and gender matched healthy controls and MCI, whereas graph filtration reached a maximum accuracy of 71.4\\% for the same task. This superior performance highlights the sensitivity of Vietoris-Rips filtration in detecting intricate topological features associated with neurodegeneration. The findings underscore the potential of persistent homology, particularly when combined with the Wasserstein distance, as a powerful tool for early diagnosis and precise classification of cognitive impairments, offering valuable insights into brain connectivity changes in MCI."

Current studies mostly use linear encoding models for clarity, even though brain responses are often nonlinear. This has sparked interest in developing nonlinear encoding models that are still interpretable. To address this problem, we propose LinBridge, a learnable and flexible framework based on Jacobian analysis for interpreting nonlinear encoding models. LinBridge posits that the nonlinear mapping between ANN representations and neural responses can be factorized into a linear inherent component that approximates the complex nonlinear relationship, and a mapping bias that captures sample-selective nonlinearity. The Jacobian matrix, which reflects output change rates relative to input, enables the analysis of sample-selective mapping in nonlinear models. LinBridge employs a self-supervised learning strategy to extract both the linear inherent component and nonlinear mapping biases from the Jacobian matrices of the test set, allowing it to adapt effectively to various nonlinear encoding models. We validate the LinBridge framework in the scenario of neural visual encoding, using computational visual representations from CLIP-ViT to predict brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the linear inherent component extracted by LinBridge accurately reflects the complex mappings of nonlinear neural encoding models; 2) the sample-selective mapping bias elucidates the variability of nonlinearity across different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. This study presents a novel tool for interpreting nonlinear neural encoding models and offers fresh evidence about hierarchical nonlinearity distribution in the visual cortex."

Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles."

To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures.   The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches.   By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented.

However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN."

      "abstract": "In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain."

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP)."

Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control."

Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities. Drawing inspiration from the success of pre-trained large models in NLP, computer vision, and speech processing, NeuGPT is architected to process a diverse array of neural recordings and interact with speech and text data. Our model mainly focus on brain-to-text decoding, improving SOTA from 6.94 to 12.92 on BLEU-1 and 6.93 to 13.06 on ROUGE-1F.

However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community."

In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well. We show that this enables spatial inductive biases, spatial data augmentations, better interpretability, zero-shot generalisation between datasets, and data harmonisation."

However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces."

Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.

We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

While SSL has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, their adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by three key pitfalls: Small pre-training dataset sizes, architectures inadequate for 3D medical image analysis, and insufficient evaluation practices. We address these issues by i) leveraging a large-scale dataset of 44k 3D brain MRI volumes and ii) using a Residual Encoder U-Net architecture within the state-of-the-art nnU-Net framework. iii) A robust development framework, incorporating 5 development and 8 testing brain MRI segmentation datasets, allowed performance-driven design decisions to optimize the simple concept of Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) for 3D CNNs. The resulting model not only surpasses previous SSL methods but also outperforms the strong nnU-Net baseline by an average of approximately 3 Dice points. Furthermore, our model demonstrates exceptional stability, achieving the highest average rank of 2 out of 7 methods, compared to the second-best method's mean rank of 3."

      "abstract": "We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger-Meitner electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event coincidence ion, electron time-of-flight and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger-Meitner decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger-Meitner electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology, which enables well-defined initial conditions, gas-phase, high activity introduction of Auger-Meitner emitters into the detection region, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities, which enables the simultaneous detection of many electrons emitted in a single decay.   The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger-Meitner multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. As the multiplicities are binned by energy, this data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger-Meitner electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes."

Capturing images using multispectral camera arrays has gained importance in medical, agricultural, and environmental processes. Due to fabrication differences, noise, or device altering, varying pixel sensitivities occur, influencing classification processes. Therefore, color calibration between the cameras is necessary. In existing methods, one of the camera images is chosen and considered as a reference, ignoring the color information of all other recordings. Our new approach does not just take one image as reference, but uses statistical information such as the location parameter to generate a consensus image as basis for calibration. This way, we managed to improve the PSNR values for the linear regression color correction algorithm by 1.15 dB and the improved color difference (iCID) values by 2.81."

      "abstract": "Non-rigid point cloud registration is a critical challenge in 3D scene understanding, particularly in surgical navigation. Although existing methods achieve excellent performance when trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets, these datasets are prohibitively expensive to collect and annotate, e.g., organ data in authentic medical scenarios. With insufficient training samples and data noise, existing methods degrade significantly since non-rigid patterns are more flexible and complicated than rigid ones, and the distributions across samples are more distinct, leading to higher difficulty in representation learning with few data. In this work, we aim to deal with this challenging few-shot non-rigid point cloud registration problem. Based on the observation that complex non-rigid transformation patterns can be decomposed into rigid and small non-rigid transformations, we propose a novel and effective framework, UniRiT. UniRiT adopts a two-step registration strategy that first aligns the centroids of the source and target point clouds and then refines the registration with non-rigid transformations, thereby significantly reducing the problem complexity. To validate the performance of UniRiT on real-world datasets, we introduce a new dataset, MedMatch3D, which consists of real human organs and exhibits high variability in sample distribution. We further establish a new challenging benchmark for few-shot non-rigid registration. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that UniRiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on MedMatch3D, improving the existing best approach by 94.22%."

This study proposes a dynamic frame prediction method for dynamic PET imaging, reduc-ing dynamic PET scanning time by applying a multi-module deep learning framework composed of reversible and irreversible modules. The network can predict kinetic parameter images based on the early frames of dynamic PET images, and then generate complete dynamic PET images. In validation experiments with simulated data, our network demonstrated good predictive performance for kinetic parameters and was able to reconstruct high-quality dynamic PET images. Additionally, in clinical data experiments, the network exhibited good generalization performance and attached that the proposed method has promising clinical application prospects."

      "abstract": "Sleep monitoring plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, with sleep staging serving as an essential metric in the monitoring process. Traditional methods, utilizing medical sensors like EEG and ECG, can be effective but often present challenges such as unnatural user experience, complex deployment, and high costs. Ballistocardiography~(BCG), a type of piezoelectric sensor signal, offers a non-invasive, user-friendly, and easily deployable alternative for long-term home monitoring. However, reliable BCG-based sleep staging is challenging due to the limited sleep monitoring data available for BCG. A restricted training dataset prevents the model from generalization across populations. Additionally, transferring to BCG faces difficulty ensuring model robustness when migrating from other data sources. To address these issues, we introduce SleepNetZero, a zero-shot learning based approach for sleep staging. To tackle the generalization challenge, we propose a series of BCG feature extraction methods that align BCG components with corresponding respiratory, cardiac, and movement channels in PSG. This allows models to be trained on large-scale PSG datasets that are diverse in population. For the migration challenge, we employ data augmentation techniques, significantly enhancing generalizability. We conducted extensive training and testing on large datasets~(12393 records from 9637 different subjects), achieving an accuracy of 0.803 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.718. ZeroSleepNet was also deployed in real prototype~(monitoring pads) and tested in actual hospital settings~(265 users), demonstrating an accuracy of 0.697 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.589. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first known reliable BCG-based sleep staging effort and marks a significant step towards in-home health monitoring."

This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of the brain, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this research. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved. In order to evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the features via the following machine learning models: KNN, Logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Perception. CNN and machine learning models were also evaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the CNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the patient."

      "abstract": "Image generation is a prevailing technique for clinical data augmentation for advancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing healthcare disparities. Diffusion Model (DM) has become a leading method in generating synthetic medical images, but it suffers from a critical twofold bias: (1) The quality of images generated for Caucasian individuals is significantly higher, as measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). (2) The ability of the downstream-task learner to learn critical features from disease images varies across different skin tones. These biases pose significant risks, particularly in skin disease detection, where underrepresentation of certain skin tones can lead to misdiagnosis or neglect of specific conditions. To address these challenges, we propose FairSkin, a novel DM framework that mitigates these biases through a three-level resampling mechanism, ensuring fairer representation across racial and disease categories. Our approach significantly improves the diversity and quality of generated images, contributing to more equitable skin disease detection in clinical settings."

When the study population consists of heterogeneous subgroups, the standard JM may be inadequate and lead to misleading results. Joint latent class models (JLCMs) and their variants have been proposed to incorporate latent class structures into JMs. JLCMs are useful for identifying latent subgroup structures, obtaining a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between longitudinal outcomes, and improving prediction performance. We consider the generic form of JLCM, which poses significant computational challenges for both frequentist and Bayesian approaches due to the numerical intractability and multimodality of the associated model's likelihood or posterior. Focusing on the less explored Bayesian paradigm, we propose a new Bayesian inference framework to tackle key limitations in the existing method. Our algorithm leverages state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques and parallel computing for parameter estimation and model selection. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed method over the existing approach. Our simulations also generate important computational insights and practical guidance for implementing such complex models. We illustrate our method using data from the PAQUID prospective cohort study, where we jointly investigate the association between a repeatedly measured cognitive score and the risk of dementia and the latent class structure defined from the longitudinal outcomes."

However, traditional FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), face difficulties in generalizing across domains due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics across institutions. This challenge is particularly evident in pancreas MRI segmentation, where anatomical variability and imaging artifacts significantly impact performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FL algorithms for pancreas MRI segmentation and introduce a novel approach that incorporates adaptive aggregation weights. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each client during model aggregation, our method accounts for domain-specific differences and improves generalization across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces the impact of domain shift compared to conventional FL methods while maintaining privacy-preserving capabilities. Significant performance improvements are observed across multiple hospitals (centers)."
