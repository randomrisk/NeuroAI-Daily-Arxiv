      "abstract": "Decoding emotion from brain activity could unlock a deeper understanding of the human experience. While a number of existing datasets align brain data with speech and with speech transcripts, no datasets have annotated brain data with sentiment. To bridge this gap, we explore the use of pre-trained Text-to-Sentiment models to annotate non invasive brain recordings, acquired using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants listened to audiobooks. Having annotated the text, we employ force-alignment of the text and audio to align our sentiment labels with the brain recordings. It is straightforward then to train Brainto-Sentiment models on these data. Experimental results show an improvement in balanced accuracy for Brain-to-Sentiment compared to baseline, supporting the proposed approach as a proof-of-concept for leveraging existing MEG datasets and learning to decode sentiment directly from the brain.",

      "abstract": "This study proposes an efficient Densely Swin Hybrid (EDSH) framework for brain tumor MRI analysis, designed to jointly capture fine grained texture patterns and long range contextual dependencies. Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale MRI dataset (stringent 40,260 images across four tumor classes) demonstrates consistent superiority over standalone CNNs, Vision Transformers, and hybrids, achieving 98.50 accuracy and recall on the test unseen dataset.",

Unlike Transformer architectures that employ dense attention mechanisms with   O(n^2) computational complexity, RSGN embeds computational nodes in learned hyperbolic space where connection strength   decays with geodesic distance, achieving dynamic sparsity that adapts to each input. The architecture operates on two   distinct timescales: fast differentiable activation propagation optimized through gradient descent, and slow   Hebbian-inspired structural learning for connectivity adaptation through local correlation rules. We provide rigorous   mathematical analysis demonstrating that RSGN achieves O(n*k) computational complexity, where k << n represents the average   active neighborhood size. Experimental evaluation on hierarchical classification and long-range dependency tasks   demonstrates that RSGN achieves 96.5% accuracy on long-range dependency tasks while using approximately 15x fewer   parameters than standard Transformers. On challenging hierarchical classification with 20 classes, RSGN achieves 23.8%   accuracy (compared to 5% random baseline) with only 41,672 parameters, nearly 10x fewer than the Transformer baselines   which require 403,348 parameters to achieve 30.1% accuracy. Our ablation studies confirm the contribution of each architectural   component, with Hebbian learning providing consistent improvements.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in fMRI-based image reconstruction have achieved remarkable photo-realistic fidelity. Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas.",

Experiments on EEG-based seizure detection indicate that state-of-the-art VLMs under RAICL achieved better or comparable performance with traditional time series based approaches. These findings suggest a new direction in physiological signal processing that effectively bridges the modalities of vision, language, and neural activities.

However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the \"cocktail party\" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations.

      "abstract": "Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) remains challenging due to strong inter-subject variability, which induces substantial distribution shifts in EEG signals, as well as the high complexity of emotion-related neural representations in both spatial organization and temporal evolution. Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.",

To address this challenge, we introduce BrainDistill, a novel implantable motor decoding pipeline that integrates an implantable neural decoder (IND) with a task-specific knowledge distillation (TSKD) framework. Unlike standard feature distillation methods that attempt to preserve teacher representations in full, TSKD explicitly prioritizes features critical for decoding through supervised projection.

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT.

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels.

Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all.

NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning.

Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas.",

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects.

However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter \u03bbin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global \u03bband do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.   In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.",

      "abstract": "Large-scale neuroimaging studies often collect data from multiple scanners across different sites, where variations in scanners, scanning procedures, and other conditions across sites can introduce artificial site effects. These effects may bias brain connectivity measures, such as functional connectivity (FC), which quantify functional network organization derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). How to leverage high-dimensional network structures to effectively mitigate site effects has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we propose SLACC (Sparse LAtent Covariate-driven Connectome) factorization, a multivariate method that explicitly parameterizes covariate effects in latent subject scores corresponding to sparse rank-1 latent patterns derived from brain connectivity. The proposed method identifies localized site-driven variability within and across brain networks, enabling targeted correction. We develop a penalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, incorporating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to guide optimization. Extensive simulations validate SLACC's robustness in recovering the true parameters and underlying connectivity patterns. Applied to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, SLACC demonstrates its ability to reduce site effects. The R package to implement our method is publicly available.",

In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.   We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity.

Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized.

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.",

This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.",

I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.",

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.",

EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%.

We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency. Empirically, across translation tasks in medical imaging, remote sensing, and electroluminescence semantic mapping, our framework improves structural fidelity and semantic consistency while converging in fewer denoising steps.",

Major research and implementation efforts have been devoted to indexing articles according to the major topics discussed, but much less effort to indexing their publication types and study designs (collectively, PTs). In this Perspective, we discuss how indexing PTs differs from topical MeSH indexing and requires a different approach. Materials and Methods. Rather than focus on the technical aspects of machine learning-based indexing models, we emphasize the goals and purposes for which biomedical articles are indexed, and the surprisingly thorny question of how indexing systems should be evaluated. Results. Topical Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms are assigned to articles that cover the major topics discussed; when more than one term is applicable, only the most specific term is assigned. In contrast, PTs are assigned to articles that have a given structure or use a particular design. To meet the needs of end users, particularly groups involved in evidence syntheses, PT indexing needs to be comprehensive and employ probabilistic prediction scores. Whereas existing NLM hierarchies place publication types and study design-related terms on separate trees from each other, a unified rubric permits more appropriate retrieval via automatic expansion. Discussion. Automated PT indexing systems should allow users to input article records or full text pdfs and receive scores in real time. This will offer consistent indexing across bibliographic databases, as well as preprints and unpublished manuscripts. Conclusions. Automated PT indexing systems, properly designed and implemented, hold the promise of greatly improving the retrieval of biomedical articles, saving substantial effort when writing evidence syntheses and benefiting other users as well.",

      "abstract": "In biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence has become a pivotal tool for enhancing medical diagnostics, particularly in medical image classification tasks such as detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays and breast cancer screening. However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment. The proposed method validates the feasibility of integrating generative augmentation with quantum-enhanced modeling in real-world medical imaging tasks, offering a novel research pathway for developing highly reliable medical AI systems in small-sample, highly imbalanced, and high-risk diagnostic scenarios.",

Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm.

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a partial remedy by grounding predictions in external knowledge. However, conventional RAG depends on semantic similarity, introducing new spurious correlations. We propose Multimodal Causal Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a framework that integrates causal inference principles with multimodal retrieval. It retrieves clinically relevant exemplars and causal graphs from external sources, conditioning model reasoning on counterfactual and interventional evidence rather than correlations alone. Applied to radiology report generation, diagnosis prediction, and visual question answering, it improves factual accuracy, robustness to distribution shifts, and interpretability.
