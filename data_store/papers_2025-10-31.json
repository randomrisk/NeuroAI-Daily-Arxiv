We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches.

As an application, we introduce a neural-network procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework.

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

Specifically, we demonstrate how malicious bit flips induced via Rowhammer can trigger implanted neural Trojans, leading to targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses (e.g., tumors or lesions) in medical scans. Through extensive experiments on benchmark medical imaging datasets such as ISIC, Brain Tumor, and MedMNIST, we show that such attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates about 82.51% and 92.56% in MobileViT and SwinTransformer, respectively. We further investigate how architectural properties, such as model sparsity, attention weight distribution, and the number of features of the layer, impact attack effectiveness.

While powerful for static associative memories, it falls short in modeling sequential memory, where transitions between memories are essential. We introduce the Exponential Dynamic Energy Network (EDEN), a novel architecture that extends the energy paradigm to temporal domains by evolving the energy function over multiple timescales. EDEN combines a static high-capacity energy network with a slow, asymmetrically interacting modulatory population, enabling robust and controlled memory transitions. We formally derive short-timescale energy functions that govern local dynamics and use them to analytically compute memory escape times, revealing a phase transition between static and dynamic regimes. The analysis of capacity, defined as the number of memories that can be stored with minimal error rate as a function of the dimensions of the state space (number of feature neurons), for EDEN shows that it achieves exponential sequence memory capacity $O(\\gamma^N)$, outperforming the linear capacity $O(N)$ of conventional models. Furthermore, EDEN's dynamics resemble the activity of time and ramping cells observed in the human brain during episodic memory tasks, grounding its biological relevance. By unifying static and sequential memory within a dynamic energy framework, EDEN offers a scalable and interpretable model for high-capacity temporal memory in both artificial and biological systems.",

We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.",

In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.",

      "abstract": "Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.",

Traditional approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.",

Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%) for lateralization.

However, problems in rendering can create sensorimotor disruptions that undermine presence and task performance. Presence is typically assessed with post-hoc questionnaires, but their coarse temporal resolution limits insight into how sensorimotor disruptions shape user experience. Here, we combined questionnaires with electroencephalography (EEG) to identify neural markers of presence-affecting prediction error in immersive VR. Twenty-five participants performed a grasp-and-place task under two levels of immersion (visual-only vs.~visuo-haptic). Occasional oddball-like sensorimotor disruptions introduced premature feedback to elicit prediction errors. Overall, higher immersion enhanced self-presence but not physical presence, while accuracy and speed improved over time irrespective of immersion. At the neural level, sensorimotor disruptions elicited robust event-related potential effects at FCz and Pz, accompanied by increases in frontal midline $\\theta$ and posterior $\\alpha$ suppression. Through source analyses localized to anterior- and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC/PCC) we found that PCC $\\alpha$ activity showed heightened sensitivity to disruptions exclusively in visuo-haptic immersion. Exploratory moderation analyses by presence scores revealed no consistent patterns. Together, these results suggest that higher immersion amplifies both the benefits and costs of sensorimotor coherence.",

Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.",

In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering.

We present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.",

Several studies have found that pulsed wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed. Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency, local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.",

Inspired by the framework of traditional Chinese lanterns, the electrode expands uniformly within the ventricle and conforms to the ependymal wall. Compared with conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal stability and immunocompatibility. Resting-state spectral analyses revealed a maximum effective bandwidth comparable to subdural ECoG. In evoked potential tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over 112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable through 168 days. We further designed an \"action-memory T-maze\" task and developed a microstate sequence classifier (MSSC) to predict rats' turn decisions. The LV-BCI achieved prediction accuracy up to 98%, significantly outperforming subdural ECoG, indicating enhanced access to decision-related information from deep structures such as the hippocampus. These results establish the lateral ventricle as a viable route for neural signal acquisition. Using a lantern-inspired flexible electrode, we achieve long-term stable recordings and robust memory decision decoding from within the ventricular system, opening new directions for BCI technology and systems neuroscience.",

Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds.

Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.",

We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated, multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head for causal temporal integration.   Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds, RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by +0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 / +2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest computational overhead.

However, such spatial sparsity of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.",

To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization.

In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering.

In response, we propose MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human visual perception.

Current fiber clustering strategies primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore, microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from each source of information separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.",

      "abstract": "A fine-grained account of functional selectivity in the cortex is essential for understanding how visual information is processed and represented in the brain. Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder-decoder transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a \"digital twin\" offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses about visual selectivity in the human brain - hypotheses that can guide future fMRI experiments.

However, brain signals infused with prior knowledge and associations exhibit a significant information asymmetry when compared to raw visual features, still posing challenges for decoding fMRI representations under the supervision of images. Consequently, the reconstructed images often lack fine-grained visual fidelity, such as missing attributes and distorted spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose BrainCognizer, a novel brain decoding model inspired by human visual cognition, which explores multi-level semantics and correlations without fine-tuning of generative models. Specifically, BrainCognizer introduces two modules: the Cognitive Integration Module which incorporates prior human knowledge to extract hierarchical region semantics; and the Cognitive Correlation Module which captures contextual semantic relationships across regions. Incorporating these two modules enhances intra-region semantic consistency and maintains inter-region contextual associations, thereby facilitating fine-grained brain decoding. Moreover, we quantitatively interpret our components from a neuroscience perspective and analyze the associations between different visual patterns and brain functions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that BrainCognizer outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple evaluation metrics.",

We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy.

Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\\%(Table.\\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway.

We model the molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate non-rotating components of the molecular gas -- the most likely contributor to future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and within the central kiloparsec. Our results indicate that the probability of occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.",

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data.

While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.",

We trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties, including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49) compared to a baseline methods.

The research aims to investigate what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) data.

We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset.

To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement.

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

This is particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized.

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.",

To analyze the impact of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This, however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression. We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching.

We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process.

While this enhances user experience, recent research reveals that it exposes a non-trivial attack surface through network side-channels. Adversaries can exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to infer sensitive information and reconstruct private conversations. In response, LLM providers and third-party services are deploying defenses such as traffic padding and obfuscation to mitigate these vulnerabilities.   This paper starts by presenting a systematic analysis of contemporary side-channel defenses in mainstream LLM applications, with a focus on services from vendors like OpenAI and DeepSeek. We identify and examine seven representative deployment scenarios, each incorporating active/passive mitigation techniques. Despite these enhanced security measures, our investigation uncovers significant residual information that remains vulnerable to leakage within the network traffic.   Building on this discovery, we introduce NetEcho, a novel, LLM-based framework that comprehensively unleashes the network side-channel risks of today's LLM applications. NetEcho is designed to recover entire conversations -- including both user prompts and LLM responses -- directly from encrypted network traffic. It features a deliberate design that ensures high-fidelity text recovery, transferability across different deployment scenarios, and moderate operational cost. In our evaluations on medical and legal applications built upon leading models like DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, NetEcho can recover avg $\\sim$70\\% information of each conversation, demonstrating a critical limitation in current defense mechanisms.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory.

The stopping power describes the average particle motion, which is encoded in the distribution of prompt-gamma photon emissions in time and space. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal emission distribution from multi-detector Prompt Gamma Timing (PGT) data. Solving this inverse problem relies on an accurate model of the prompt-gamma transport and detection including explicitly the dependencies on the time of emission and detection. Our previous work relied on Monte-Carlo (MC) based system models. The tradeoff between computational resources and statistical noise in the system model prohibits studies of new detector arrangements and beam scanning scenarios. Therefore, we propose here an analytical system model to speed up recalculations for new beam positions and to avoid statistical noise in the model. We evaluated the model for the MERLINO multi-detector-PGT prototype. Comparisons between the analytical model and a MC-based reference showed excellent agreement for single-detector setups. When several detectors were placed close together and partially obstructed each other, intercrystal scatter led to differences of up to 10 % between the analytical and MC-based model. Nevertheless, when evaluating the performance in reconstructing the spatiotemporal distribution and estimating the stopping power, no significant difference between the models was observed. Hence, the procedure proved robust against the small inaccuracies of the model for the tested scenarios. The model calculation time was reduced by 1500 times, now enabling many new studies for PGT-based systems.",

This graph is used exclusively to represent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any sensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC) federated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client configuration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes place within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct supervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by the hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only return aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance feedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the clinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a cKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context of real-world hospital environments.

Currently, there are only a handful of non-invasive monitoring systems. Optical methods offer molecular specificity (i.e., multi-biomarker monitoring) but have shallow reach (a few millimeters); ultrasound penetrates deeper but lacks specificity; and MRI is large, slow, and costly. Photoacoustic (PA) sensing combines the best of optical and ultrasound methods. A laser transmitter emits pulses that are absorbed by different molecules, providing specificity. These light pulses generate pressure changes that are captured by an ultrasound receiver, providing depth. Photoacoustic sensing is promising, but the current platforms are bulky, complex, and costly. We propose the first embedded PA platform. Our contributions are fourfold. First, inspired by LiDAR technology, we propose a novel transmitter that emits pulses similar to those in the state-of-the-art (SoA), but instead of using high-voltage sources and complex electronic interfaces, we use a simple low-power microcontroller (MCU). Second, we carry out a thorough analysis of our custom transmitter and a commercial system. Third, we build a basic ultrasound receiver that is able to process the faint signal generated by our transmitter. Lastly, we compare the performance of our platform against a SoA commercial system, and show that we can detect glucose and (de)oxygenated hemoglobin in two controlled solution studies. The resulting signal characteristics indicate a plausible path toward noninvasive, real-time, at-home sensing relevant to diabetes care.
