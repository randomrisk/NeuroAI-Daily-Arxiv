      "abstract": "Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods."

The resulting AMAES framework is based on masked-image-modeling and intensity-based augmentation reversal and balances memory usage, runtime, and finetuning performance. Using the popular U-Net and the recent MedNeXt architecture as backbones, we evaluate the effect of pretraining on three challenging downstream tasks, covering single-sequence, low-resource settings, and out-of-domain generalization. The results highlight that pretraining on the proposed dataset with AMAES significantly improves segmentation performance in the majority of evaluated cases, and that it is beneficial to pretrain the model with augmentations, despite pretraing on a large-scale dataset.

Recent advancements in self-supervised learning, particularly in contrastive learning, have demonstrated greater robustness when dealing with complex datasets. However, current approaches often fall short in generalizing across non-uniformly distributed data, prevalent in medical imaging scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that adapts dynamically during the training process, focusing on the localized neighborhoods of samples. Moreover, we expand beyond traditional structural features by incorporating brain stiffness, a mechanical property previously underexplored yet promising due to its sensitivity to age-related changes. This work presents the first application of self-supervised learning to brain mechanical properties, using compiled stiffness maps from various clinical studies to predict brain age. Our approach, featuring dynamic localized loss, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance and laying the way for new directions in brain aging research."

In the field of neuroscience, enriching a ML model for brain decoding with attribution-based XAI techniques means being able to highlight which brain areas correlate with the task at hand, thus offering valuable insights to domain experts. In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the \"StudyForrest\" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the \"Forrest Gump\" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can provide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation theory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models)."

Extending the fields-of-view of these methods is crucial for obtaining comparable quantitative results across beamlines and adapting to the smaller beam profiles of fourth-generation synchrotron sources. We introduce a novel technique combining an adapted eigenflat optimization with deformable image registration to address the challenges and enable quantitative high-resolution scans of centimeter-sized objects with micrometre resolution. We demonstrate the potential of the method by obtaining an electron density map of a rat brain sample 15 mm in diameter using speckle-based imaging, despite the limited horizontal field-of-view of 6 mm of the beamline (PETRA III, P05, operated by Hereon at DESY). This showcases the ability of the technique to significantly widen the range of application of wavefront marker-based techniques in both biological and materials science research."

To identify at-risk subjects and understand alterations of dFNC in different stages, we leverage deep learning advancements and introduce a transformer-convolution framework for predicting at-risk subjects based on dFNC, incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention to capture brain network dependencies and temporal dynamics. Our model significantly outperforms other popular machine learning methods. By analyzing individuals with diagnosed AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we studied the AD progression and observed a higher similarity between MCI and asymptomatic AD. The interpretable analysis highlights the cognitive-control network's diagnostic importance, with the model focusing on intra-visual domain dFNC when predicting asymptomatic AD subjects."

While CI research has focused on modeling the cochlear activations in response to low-level acoustic features, we hypothesize that the success of these implants is due in large part to the role of the upstream network in extracting useful features from a degraded signal and learned statistics of language to resolve the signal. In this work, we use the deep neural network (DNN) DeepSpeech2, as a paradigm to investigate how natural input and cochlear implant-based inputs are processed over time. We generate naturalistic and cochlear implant-like inputs from spoken sentences and test the similarity of model performance to human performance on analogous phoneme recognition tests. Our model reproduces error patterns in reaction time and phoneme confusion patterns under noise conditions in normal hearing and CI participant studies. We then use interpretability techniques to determine where and when confusions arise when processing naturalistic and CI-like inputs. We find that dynamics over time in each layer are affected by context as well as input type. Dynamics of all phonemes diverge during confusion and comprehension within the same time window, which is temporally shifted backward in each layer of the network. There is a modulation of this signal during processing of CI which resembles changes in human EEG signals in the auditory stream. This reduction likely relates to the reduction of encoded phoneme identity. These findings suggest that we have a viable model in which to explore the loss of speech-related information in time and that we can use it to find population-level encoding signals to target when optimizing cochlear implant inputs to improve encoding of essential speech-related information and improve perception."

Current EEG-based emotion recognition methods perform well with short segments of EEG data. However, these methods encounter significant challenges in real-life scenarios where emotional states evolve over extended periods. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attentive (DuA) transformer framework for long-term continuous EEG emotion analysis. Unlike segment-based approaches, the DuA transformer processes an entire EEG trial as a whole, identifying emotions at the trial level, referred to as trial-based emotion analysis. This framework is designed to adapt to varying signal lengths, providing a substantial advantage over traditional methods. The DuA transformer incorporates three key modules: the spatial-spectral network module, the temporal network module, and the transfer learning module. The spatial-spectral network module simultaneously captures spatial and spectral information from EEG signals, while the temporal network module detects temporal dependencies within long-term EEG data. The transfer learning module enhances the model's adaptability across different subjects and conditions. We extensively evaluate the DuA transformer using a self-constructed long-term EEG emotion database, along with two benchmark EEG emotion databases. On the basis of the trial-based leave-one-subject-out cross-subject cross-validation protocol, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DuA transformer significantly outperforms existing methods in long-term continuous EEG emotion analysis, with an average enhancement of 5.28%."

In the case of a 2-dimensional VT, two types of line integral data are usually required. These data correspond to integration of the parallel and perpendicular projection of the vector field along integration lines. VT methods are non-invasive, non-intrusive and offer more information on the field than classical point measurements; they are typically used to reconstruct divergence-free (or source-free) velocity and flow fields. In this paper, we show that VT can also be used for the reconstruction of fields with non-zero divergence. In particular, we study electric fields generated by dipole sources in bounded domains which arise, for example, in electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging. To the best of our knowledge, VT has not previously been used to reconstruct such fields. We explain in detail the theoretical background, the derivation of the electric field inverse problem and the numerical approximation of the line integrals. We show that fields with non-zero divergence can be reconstructed from the longitudinal measurements with the help of two sparsity constraints that are constructed from the transverse measurements and the vector Laplace operator. As a comparison to EEG source imaging, we note that VT does not require mathematical modelling of the sources. By numerical simulations, we show that the pattern of the electric field can be correctly estimated using VT and the location of the source activity can be determined accurately from the reconstructed magnitudes of the field."

      "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) have garnered attention for effectively processing long data sequences, reducing the need to segment time series into shorter intervals for model training and inference. Traditionally, SSMs capture only the temporal dynamics of time series data, omitting the equally critical spectral features. This study introduces EEG-SSM, a novel state-space model-based approach for dementia classification using EEG data. Our model features two primary innovations: EEG-SSM temporal and EEG-SSM spectral components. The temporal component is designed to efficiently process EEG sequences of varying lengths, while the spectral component enhances the model by integrating frequency-domain information from EEG signals. The synergy of these components allows EEG-SSM to adeptly manage the complexities of multivariate EEG data, significantly improving accuracy and stability across different temporal resolutions. Demonstrating a remarkable 91.0 percent accuracy in classifying Healthy Control (HC), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) groups, EEG-SSM outperforms existing models on the same dataset. The development of EEG-SSM represents an improvement in the use of state-space models for screening dementia, offering more precise and cost-effective tools for clinical neuroscience."

QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise.

Despite their promise, BCIs face a significant challenge in maintaining decoding accuracy over time due to neural nonstationarities. However, the decoding accuracy of BCI drops severely across days due to the neural data drift. While current recalibration techniques address this issue to a degree, they often fail to leverage the limited labeled data, to consider the signal correlation between two days, or to perform conditional alignment in regression tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance recalibration performance. We begin with preliminary experiments that reveal the temporal patterns of neural signal changes and identify three critical elements for effective recalibration: global alignment, conditional speed alignment, and feature-label consistency. Building on these insights, we propose the Speed-enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Regression (SSAR) framework, integrating semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation techniques in regression neural decoding. SSAR employs Speed-enhanced Subdomain Alignment (SeSA) for global and speed conditional alignment of similarly labeled data, with Contrastive Consistency Constraint (CCC) to enhance the alignment of SeSA by reinforcing feature-label consistency through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive set of experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, substantiate the superior recalibration performance and robustness of SSAR."

EEG is extensively used in traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and high temporal resolution. This makes it invaluable for identifying different brain states relevant to both medical and non-medical applications. Although this practice is widely recognized, current methods are mainly confined to lab or clinical environments because they rely on data from multiple EEG electrodes covering the entire head. Nonetheless, a significant advancement for these applications would be their adaptation for \"real-world\" use, using portable devices with a single-channel. In this study, we tackle this challenge through two distinct strategies: the first approach involves training models with data from multiple channels and then testing new trials on data from a single channel individually. The second method focuses on training with data from a single channel and then testing the performances of the models on data from all the other channels individually. To efficiently classify cognitive tasks from EEG data, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with only a few parameters and fast learnable spectral-temporal features. We demonstrated the feasibility of these approaches on EEG data recorded during mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks from three datasets. We achieved the highest accuracies of 100%, 91.55% and 73.45% in binary and 3-class classification on specific channels across three datasets. This study can contribute to the development of single-channel BCI and provides a robust EEG biomarker for brain states classification."

Nevertheless, the continuous generation of brain signals in BCI frameworks poses challenges for efficient storage and real-time transmission. While considering the human brain as a semantic source, the meaningful information associated with cognitive activities often gets obscured by substantial noise present in acquired brain signals, resulting in abundant redundancy. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal brain-computer semantic communication paradigm, named EidetiCom, for decoding visual perception under limited-bandwidth constraint. The framework consists of three hierarchical layers, each responsible for compressing the semantic information of brain signals into representative features. These low-dimensional compact features are transmitted and converted into semantically meaningful representations at the receiver side, serving three distinct tasks for decoding visual perception: brain signal-based visual classification, brain-to-caption translation, and brain-to-image generation, in a scalable manner. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm facilitates the semantic communication under low bit rate conditions ranging from 0.017 to 0.192 bits-per-sample, achieving high-quality semantic reconstruction and highlighting its potential for efficient storage and real-time communication of brain recordings in BCI applications, such as eidetic memory storage and assistive communication for patients."

Furthermore, we identify current shortcomings and propose future research directions in manifold learning and riemannian-based classification, focusing on practical implementations and theoretical expansions, such as feature tracking on manifolds, multitask learning, feature extraction, and transfer learning.

The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\\textbf{8.0}\\%$ on the DSEC dataset.

In this study, we investigated the interpretability of features derived from brain network lateralization, benchmarking against widely used techniques like power spectrum density (PSD), common spatial pattern (CSP), and Riemannian geometry. We focused on the spatial distribution of the functional connectivity within and between hemispheres during motor imagery tasks, introducing network-based metrics such as integration and segregation. Evaluating these metrics across multiple EEG-based BCI datasets, our findings reveal that network lateralization offers neurophysiological plausible insights, characterized by stronger lateralization in sensorimotor and frontal areas contralateral to imagined movements. While these lateralization features did not outperform CSP and Riemannian geometry in terms of classification accuracy, they demonstrated competitive performance against PSD alone and provided biologically relevant interpretation. This study underscores the potential of brain network lateralization as a new feature to be integrated in motor imagery-based BCIs for enhancing the interpretability of noninvasive applications.",

Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to decode speech is particularly promising due to its non-invasive nature. However, recordings are typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\\% and a top-10 accuracy of 76\\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the data was limited to the typical amount used in practice ($\\sim$10 hours), the top-1 accuracy dropped to 2.5\\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical realization of EEG-based speech BCIs."

In the field of neuroscience, enriching a ML model for brain decoding with attribution-based XAI techniques means being able to highlight which brain areas correlate with the task at hand, thus offering valuable insights to domain experts. In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the \"StudyForrest\" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the \"Forrest Gump\" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can provide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation theory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models)."

In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features.

The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features.

However, these approaches with unsupervised node partitions predict outcomes inefficiently with independently established connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the Supervised Brain Parcellation (SBP), a brain node parcellation scheme informed by the downstream predictive task. With voxel-level functional time courses generated under resting-state or cognitive tasks as input, our approach clusters voxels into nodes in a manner that maximizes the correlation between inter-node connections and the behavioral outcome, while also accommodating intra-node homogeneity. We rigorously evaluate the SBP approach using resting-state and task-based fMRI data from both the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our analyses show that SBP significantly improves out-of-sample connectome-based predictive performance compared to conventional step-wise methods under various brain atlases.

Methods: To address this gap, our study firstly leveraged fMRI to delineate activated regions associated with positive and negative emotions in healthy individuals, resulting in the creation of positive emotion atlas (PEA) and negative emotion atlas (NEA). Subsequently, we examined neuroimaging changes in depression patients using these atlases and evaluated their diagnostic performance based on machine learning. Results: Our findings demonstrate that the classification accuracy of depressed patients based on PEA and NEA exceeded 0.70, a notable improvement compared to the whole-brain atlases. Furthermore, ALFF analysis unveiled significant differences between depressed patients and healthy controls in eight functional clusters during the NEA, focusing on the left cuneus, cingulate gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. In contrast, the PEA revealed more pronounced differences across fifteen clusters, involving the right fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule. Limitations: Due to the limited sample size and subtypes of depressed patients, the efficacy may need further validation in future. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the complex interplay between emotion modulation and depression, showcasing significant alterations in both PEA and NEA among depression patients.

Despite these successes, most studies to date concern unimodal DNNs, encoding either visual or textual input but not both. Yet, there is growing evidence that human meaning representations integrate linguistic and sensory-motor information. Here we investigate whether the integration of multimodal information operated by current vision-and-language DNN models (VLMs) leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity than those obtained by language-only and vision-only DNNs. We focus on fMRI responses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of either a full sentence or an accompanying picture. Our results reveal that VLM representations correlate more strongly than language- and vision-only DNNs with activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. A comparison between different types of visuo-linguistic architectures shows that recent generative VLMs tend to be less brain-aligned than previous architectures with lower performance on downstream applications. Moreover, through an additional analysis comparing brain vs. behavioural alignment across multiple VLMs, we show that -- with one remarkable exception -- representations that strongly align with behavioural judgments do not correlate highly with brain responses. This indicates that brain similarity does not go hand in hand with behavioural similarity, and vice versa."

Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: By integrating spatiotemporal modelling within a realistic head model derived from high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI, we analyze the complex interplay between blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain tissue dynamics. This inclusion of a realistic head model not only enriches the accuracy of our simulations but is also beneficial for understanding the physiological and hemodynamic responses within the human brain."

Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low-dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in the Poincar\\'e disk model of hyperbolic geometry. Here, we define a local measure of distortion of the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain networks dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from DWI and fMRI scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method identifies more accurately the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormality detection in memory-related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing disease progression."

      "abstract": "Understanding neural activity and information representation is crucial for advancing knowledge of brain function and cognition. Neural activity, measured through techniques like electrophysiology and neuroimaging, reflects various aspects of information processing. Recent advances in deep neural networks offer new approaches to analyzing these signals using pre-trained models. However, challenges arise due to discrepancies between different neural signal modalities and the limited scale of high-quality neural data. To address these challenges, we present NeuroBind, a general representation that unifies multiple brain signal types, including EEG, fMRI, calcium imaging, and spiking data. To achieve this, we align neural signals in these image-paired neural datasets to pre-trained vision-language embeddings. Neurobind is the first model that studies different neural modalities interconnectedly and is able to leverage high-resource modality models for various neuroscience tasks. We also showed that by combining information from different neural signal modalities, NeuroBind enhances downstream performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different neural modalities. As a result, we can leverage multiple types of neural signals mapped to the same space to improve downstream tasks, and demonstrate the complementary strengths of different neural modalities. This approach holds significant potential for advancing neuroscience research, improving AI systems, and developing neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces."

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

Nonetheless, whether these fMRI-induced higher-order properties play a role in disentangling other neuroimaging modalities' insights remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this work, by analyzing fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset using persistent homology, we discovered that the volume-optimal persistence homological scaffolds of fMRI-based functional connectomes exhibited conservative topological reconfigurations from the resting state to attentional task-positive state. Specifically, while reflecting the extent to which each cortical region contributed to functional cycles following different cognitive demands, these reconfigurations were constrained such that the spatial distribution of cavities in the connectome is relatively conserved. Most importantly, such level of contributions covaried with powers of aperiodic activities mostly within the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) band measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG). This comprehensive result suggests that fMRI-induced hemodynamics and MEG theta-alpha aperiodic activities are governed by the same functional constraints specific to each cortical morpho-structure. Methodologically, our work paves the way toward an innovative computing paradigm in multimodal neuroimaging topological learning.",

Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted.

On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets.

EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%.

Non-invasive cerebral signaling techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and practicality, avoiding invasive electrode implantation. However, current works under-investigated three points: 1) a predominant focus on EEG with limited exploration of MEG, which provides superior signal quality; 2) poor performance on unseen text, indicating the need for models that can better generalize to diverse linguistic contexts; 3) insufficient integration of information from other modalities, which could potentially constrain our capacity to comprehensively understand the intricate dynamics of brain activity.

In this study we demonstrate that when trials relating to a single object are allowed to appear in both the training and testing sets, almost any classification algorithm is capable of learning the representation of an object given only category labels. This ability to learn object representations is of particular significance as it suggests that the results of several published studies which predict the category of observed objects from EEG signals may be affected by a subtle form of leakage which has inflated their reported accuracies. We demonstrate the ability of both simple classification algorithms, and sophisticated deep learning models, to learn object representations given only category labels.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1.

However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

In this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation of SAM 2's ability to segment both 2D and 3D medical images. We collect 18 medical imaging datasets, including common 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound. We consider two evaluation pipelines of SAM 2: (1) multi-frame 3D segmentation, where prompts are provided to one or multiple slice(s) selected from the volume, and (2) single-frame 2D segmentation, where prompts are provided to each slice. The former is only applicable to 3D modalities, while the latter applies to both 2D and 3D modalities. We learn that SAM 2 exhibits similar performance as SAM under single-frame 2D segmentation, and has variable performance under multi-frame 3D segmentation depending on the choices of slices to annotate, the direction of the propagation, the predictions utilized during the propagation, etc."

      "abstract": "The emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in solving medical questions. They can possess considerable medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a vanilla RAG system and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs brought by i-MedRAG compared with vanilla RAG on complex questions from clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all existing prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods on GPT-3.5, achieving an accuracy of 69.68\\% on the MedQA dataset. In addition, we characterize the scaling properties of i-MedRAG with different iterations of follow-up queries and different numbers of queries per iteration. Our case studies show that i-MedRAG can flexibly ask follow-up queries to form reasoning chains, providing an in-depth analysis of medical questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind study on incorporating follow-up queries into medical RAG."

      "abstract": "Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods."

This study analyzes a decade of work-related traffic incident data (2012--2021) in Santiago, Chile, using records from a major social insurance company. We explore temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns in these incidents in urban and rural areas. We also evaluate the impact of a 2018 urban speed limit reduction law on incident injury severity. Using negative binomial regression, we assess how various factors, including the speed limit change, affect injury severity measured by prescribed medical leave days.   Our analysis reveals distinct incident occurrence and severity patterns across different times, locations, and demographic groups. We find that motorcycles and cycles are associated with more severe injuries, with marginal effects of 26.94 and 13.06 additional days of medical leave, respectively, compared to motorized vehicles. Female workers tend to have less severe injuries, with an average of 7.57 fewer days of medical leave. Age is also a significant factor, with each year associated with 0.57 additional days of leave.   Notably, the urban speed limit reduction is associated with a decrease of 4.26 days in prescribed medical leave for incidents in urban areas, suggesting that lower speed limits contribute to reduced injury severity in work-related traffic incidents. Our results provide insights for urban planning, transportation policy, and workplace safety initiatives, highlighting the potential benefits of speed management in urban areas for improving road safety and minimizing the economic impact of work-related incidents."

      "abstract": "Large and well-annotated datasets are essential for advancing deep learning applications, however often costly or impossible to obtain by a single entity. In many areas, including the medical domain, approaches relying on data sharing have become critical to address those challenges. While effective in increasing dataset size and diversity, data sharing raises significant privacy concerns. Commonly employed anonymization methods based on the k-anonymity paradigm often fail to preserve data diversity, affecting model robustness. This work introduces a novel approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) trained on feature vectors extracted from large pre-trained vision foundation models. Foundation models effectively detect and represent complex patterns across diverse domains, allowing the CVAE to faithfully capture the embedding space of a given data distribution to generate (sample) a diverse, privacy-respecting, and potentially unbounded set of synthetic feature vectors. Our method notably outperforms traditional approaches in both medical and natural image domains, exhibiting greater dataset diversity and higher robustness against perturbations while preserving sample privacy. These results underscore the potential of generative models to significantly impact deep learning applications in data-scarce and privacy-sensitive environments.

Due to the existing limitations in human-based studies involving drug development and novel treatment monitoring, animal-based research became a necessary step for testing and protocol preparation. In this simulation-based study two unconventional, cost-effective small animal total body PET scanners (for mouse and rat studies) have been investigated in order to inspect their feasibility for preclinical research. They were designed with the novel technology explored by the Jagiellonian-PET (J-PET) Collaboration. Two main PET characteristics: sensitivity and spatial resolution were mainly inspected to evaluate their performance. Moreover, the impact of the scintillator dimension and time-of-flight on the latter parameter was examined in order to design the most efficient tomographs. The presented results show that for mouse TB J-PET the achievable system sensitivity is equal to 2.35% and volumetric spatial resolution to 9.46 +- 0.54 mm3, while for rat TB J-PET they are equal to 2.6% and 14.11 +- 0.80 mm3, respectively. Furthermore, it was shown that the designed tomographs are almost parallax-free systems, hence, they resolve the problem of the acceptance criterion tradeoff between enhancing spatial resolution and reducing sensitivity."

This Big Data is valuable within both healthcare and legal contexts, serving as a resource for investigating medical malpractice, civil cases, criminal activities, and network-related incidents. However, the rapid evolution of network technologies and data creates complexities in digital forensics investigations and audits. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure decentralised framework aimed at bolstering digital forensics readiness (DFR) in Big Data wireless medical networks by identifying security threats, complexities, and gaps in current research efforts. By improving the network's resilience to cyber threats and aiding in medical malpractice investigations, this framework significantly advances digital forensics, wireless networks, and healthcare. It enhances digital forensics readiness, incident response, and the management of medical malpractice incidents in Big Data wireless medical networks. A real-world scenario-based evaluation demonstrated the framework's effectiveness in improving forensic readiness and response capabilities, validating its practical applicability and impact. A comparison of the proposed framework with existing frameworks concluded that it is an advancement in framework design for DFR, especially in regard to Big Data processing, decentralised DFR storage and scalability."

Recent advancements in self-supervised learning, particularly in contrastive learning, have demonstrated greater robustness when dealing with complex datasets. However, current approaches often fall short in generalizing across non-uniformly distributed data, prevalent in medical imaging scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that adapts dynamically during the training process, focusing on the localized neighborhoods of samples. Moreover, we expand beyond traditional structural features by incorporating brain stiffness, a mechanical property previously underexplored yet promising due to its sensitivity to age-related changes. This work presents the first application of self-supervised learning to brain mechanical properties, using compiled stiffness maps from various clinical studies to predict brain age. Our approach, featuring dynamic localized loss, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance and laying the way for new directions in brain aging research."

State-of-the-art methods, particularly those utilizing transformers, have been prominently adopted in 3D semantic segmentation due to their superior performance in scalability and generalizability. However, plain vision transformers encounter challenges due to their neglect of local features and their high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions: Firstly, we proposed SegStitch, an innovative architecture that integrates transformers with denoising ODE blocks. Instead of taking whole 3D volumes as inputs, we adapt axial patches and customize patch-wise queries to ensure semantic consistency. Additionally, we conducted extensive experiments on the BTCV and ACDC datasets, achieving improvements up to 11.48% and 6.71% respectively in mDSC, compared to state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, our proposed method demonstrates outstanding efficiency, reducing the number of parameters by 36.7% and the number of FLOPS by 10.7% compared to UNETR. This advancement holds promising potential for adapting our method to real-world clinical practice. The code will be available at https://github.com/goblin327/SegStitch"
