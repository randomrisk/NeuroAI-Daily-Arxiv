      "abstract": "Background: Mutations in KMT2B are a recognized cause of early-onset complex dystonia, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal globus pallidus (GPi-DBS) being an effective treatment. However, gait impairment, particularly freezing of gait (FOG), remains a significant challenge in DYT-KMT2B patients post-DBS. Objectives: To characterize the emergence of FOG in DYT-KMT2B patients treated with GPi-DBS and explore potential underlying mechanisms, including striatonigral degeneration. Methods: Five patients (four females) with KMT2B-related dystonia and protein-truncating variants (PTVs) were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical progression, response to GPi-DBS, and the presence of FOG were documented. Dopaminergic function was assessed using DaTscan (SPECT for ^123I-ioflupane) in four patients. Results: FOG developed in all patients, with onset ranging from 1 to 15.5 years post-DBS. DaTscan abnormalities, indicative of bilateral striatal dopaminergic denervation, were observed in four cases. Prior to DBS, all patients exhibited dystonia unresponsive to L-dopa, and post-DBS, FOG remained refractory to dopaminergic treatment in most cases. Despite initial improvements in gait post-DBS, only one patient maintained independent ambulation at the last follow-up. Conclusions: FOG is an emerging complication in DYT-KMT2B patients with PTVs undergoing GPi-DBS, potentially linked to underlying striatonigral degeneration. The findings suggest a need for long-term motor surveillance and consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies, including dopaminergic trials, in this patient population. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving DBS-related hypokinetic gait disturbances in DYT-KMT2B dystonia."

      "abstract": "Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of a sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning."

      "abstract": "Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating \"memory interference\", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models.

Recent encoding models using deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully predicted voxel-wise activity. However, interpreting the properties that explain voxel responses remains challenging because of the black-box nature of DNNs. As a solution, we propose LLM-assisted Visual Cortex Captioning (LaVCa), a data-driven approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate natural-language captions for images to which voxels are selective. By applying LaVCa for image-evoked brain activity, we demonstrate that LaVCa generates captions that describe voxel selectivity more accurately than the previously proposed method. Furthermore, the captions generated by LaVCa quantitatively capture more detailed properties than the existing method at both the inter-voxel and intra-voxel levels. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the voxel-specific properties generated by LaVCa reveals fine-grained functional differentiation within regions of interest (ROIs) in the visual cortex and voxels that simultaneously represent multiple distinct concepts. These findings offer profound insights into human visual representations by assigning detailed captions throughout the visual cortex while highlighting the potential of LLM-based methods in understanding brain representations.

      "abstract": "The human brain utilizes spikes for information transmission and dynamically reorganizes its network structure to boost energy efficiency and cognitive capabilities throughout its lifespan. Drawing inspiration from this spike-based computation, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed to construct event-driven models that emulate this efficiency. Despite these advances, deep SNNs continue to suffer from over-parameterization during training and inference, a stark contrast to the brain's ability to self-organize. Furthermore, existing sparse SNNs are challenged by maintaining optimal pruning levels due to a static pruning ratio, resulting in either under- or over-pruning. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic structure learning approach for deep SNNs, aimed at maintaining effective sparse training from scratch while optimizing compression efficiency. The first stage evaluates the compressibility of existing sparse subnetworks within SNNs using the PQ index, which facilitates an adaptive determination of the rewiring ratio for synaptic connections based on data compression insights. In the second stage, this rewiring ratio critically informs the dynamic synaptic connection rewiring process, including both pruning and regrowth. This approach significantly improves the exploration of sparse structure training in deep SNNs, adapting sparsity dynamically from the point view of compression efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that this sparse training approach not only aligns with the performance of current deep SNNs models but also significantly improves the efficiency of compressing sparse SNNs. Crucially, it preserves the advantages of initiating training with sparse models and offers a promising solution for implementing edge AI on neuromorphic hardware."

Both procedures make inference on the existence of rapid changes for multi-subject data. We allow the change point locations to vary between subjects, conditions and brain regions. The first procedure utilizes available information about the change point locations to compare multiple shape parameters of the HR over time. In the second procedure, the change point locations are determined for each subject separately. To account for the estimation of the change point locations, we propose the notion of post selection variance. The power of the proposed procedures is assessed in simulation studies. We apply the procedure for pre-specified change point locations to data from a category learning experiment."

We focus on models that use rhythmic brain activities, such as gamma, theta, and delta oscillations, to encode phonemes, segment speech into syllables and words, and integrate linguistic elements to infer meaning. We analyze the mechanisms underlying these models, their biological plausibility, and their potential applications in processing and understanding speech in real time, a computational feature that is achieved by the human brain but not yet implemented in speech recognition models. Real-time processing enables dynamic adaptation to incoming speech, allowing systems to handle the rapid and continuous flow of auditory information required for effective communication, interactive applications, and accurate speech recognition in a variety of real-world settings. While significant progress has been made in modeling the neural basis of speech perception, challenges remain, particularly in accounting for the complexity of semantic processing and the integration of contextual influences. Moreover, the high computational demands of biologically realistic models pose practical difficulties for their implementation and analysis. Despite these limitations, these models provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of speech perception. We conclude by identifying current limitations, proposing future research directions, and suggesting how these models can be further developed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of speech processing in the human brain."

Our approach achieves a 17.2% and 17.9% improvement in prediction performance (unnormalized and normalized correlation) over traditional unimodal linear models, as well as a 7.7% and 14.4% improvement, respectively, over prior state-of-the-art models. These improvements represent a major step towards future robust in-silico testing and improved decoding performance. They also reveal how auditory and semantic information are fused in motor, somatosensory, and higher-level semantic regions, aligning with existing neurolinguistic theories.

      "abstract": "Human-robot collaboration (HRC) relies on accurate and timely recognition of human intentions to ensure seamless interactions. Among common HRC tasks, human-to-robot object handovers have been studied extensively for planning the robot's actions during object reception, assuming the human intention for object handover. However, distinguishing handover intentions from other actions has received limited attention. Most research on handovers has focused on visually detecting motion trajectories, which often results in delays or false detections when trajectories overlap. This paper investigates whether human intentions for object handovers are reflected in non-movement-based physiological signals. We conduct a multimodal analysis comparing three data modalities: electroencephalogram (EEG), gaze, and hand-motion signals. Our study aims to distinguish between handover-intended human motions and non-handover motions in an HRC setting, evaluating each modality's performance in predicting and classifying these actions before and after human movement initiation. We develop and evaluate human intention detectors based on these modalities, comparing their accuracy and timing in identifying handover intentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically develop and test intention detectors across multiple modalities within the same experimental context of human-robot handovers. Our analysis reveals that handover intention can be detected from all three modalities. Nevertheless, gaze signals are the earliest as well as the most accurate to classify the motion as intended for handover or non-handover."

We combat this problem in this paper by proposing a novel deep EEG super-resolution (SR) approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This approach can produce high spatial resolution EEG data from low resolution samples, by generating channel-wise upsampled data to effectively interpolate numerous missing channels, thus reducing the need for expensive EEG equipment. We tested the performance using an EEG dataset from a mental imagery task. Our proposed GAN model provided 10^4 fold and 10^2 fold reduction in mean-squared error (MSE) and mean-absolute error (MAE), respectively, over the baseline bicubic interpolation method. We further validate our method by training a classifier on the original classification task, which displayed minimal loss in accuracy while using the super-resolved data. The proposed SR EEG by GAN is a promising approach to improve the spatial resolution of low density EEG headsets."

This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments."

This paper proposed a biofocal masking attention-based method (SSVEP-BiMA) that synergistically leverages the native and symmetric-antisymmetric components for decoding SSVEP. By utilizing multiple signal representations, the network is able to integrate features from a wider range of sample perspectives, leading to more generalized and comprehensive feature learning, which enhances both prediction accuracy and robustness.

Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/session, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 10 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits the EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions.

The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial."

First, we examine the impact of different fine-tuning approaches on decoder performance and stability. Building on this, we integrate online test-time adaptation (OTTA) to adapt the model during deployment, complementing the effects of prior fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning that successively builds on prior subject-specific information improves both performance and stability, while OTTA effectively adapts the model to evolving data distributions across consecutive sessions, enabling calibration-free operation. These results offer valuable insights and recommendations for future research in longitudinal online MI decoding and highlight the importance of combining domain adaptation strategies for improving BCI performance in real-world applications.

Without additional training, MoTE enables meaningful and focused behavior changes in LLMs on-the-fly during inference time.   By analyzing the digital LLM brain of DeepSeek-R1 using a technique we dub 'functional Token Resonance Imaging' (fTRI) - inspired by fMRI and using prompts designed to elicit specific behavior (e.g., 'What happened {time}{place}?') - we empirically identify distinctive experts associated with behaviors like refusal responses.   Using MoTE we are able to intervene and control such specific behavior. We switched off the top 10 most refusal-relevant experts (0.07% of R1's 14,848 routed experts), achieving a 52% refusal reduction on sensitive reference prompts without performance degradation on MT-Bench. Random expert deactivation resulted in smaller behavioral shifts with increased noise, whereas forced expert activation led to significantly higher refusal rates.   Our approach shares similarities with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in terms of explainability and steerability. Unlike SAEs, MoTE does not require large training efforts, as within MoEs with a vast number of experts, specialization already emerged naturally during pretraining.   Our findings suggest that significant functional mechanisms in Mixture-of-Experts architectures can at least partially be localized in a small number of specific experts, rather than being distributed throughout the model's weights. Expert subgroups can be tuned to trigger significant behavior variations, providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs."

It can be acquired in either a resting-state or a task-based paradigm. Compared to resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI is acquired while the subject is performing a specific task designed to enhance study-related brain activities. Consequently, it generally has more informative task-dependent signals. However, due to the variety of task designs, it is much more difficult than in resting state to aggregate task-based fMRI acquired in different tasks to train a generalizable model. To resolve this complication, we propose a supervised task-aware network TA-GAT that jointly learns a general-purpose encoder and task-specific contextual information. The encoder-generated embedding and the learned contextual information are then combined as input to multiple modules for performing downstream tasks. We believe that the proposed task-aware architecture can plug-and-play in any neural network architecture to incorporate the prior knowledge of fMRI tasks into capturing functional brain patterns."

To gain further insight into the relation between human neuronal activity patterns and ontological classes, we introduced General Linear Model (GLM) analyses on fMRI data of participants who were presented with complex naturalistic video stimuli comparable to the robot tasks. We modeled four event classes (pick, place, fetch and deliver) attached to different environmental and object-related context and employed a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) on associated brain activity patterns as a starting point for an automatic hierarchical clustering. Based on the default values for the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), the activity patterns were reliably grouped according to their parent classes of object interaction and navigation. Although fetch and deliver events were also distinguished by neuronal patterns, pick and place events demonstrated higher ambiguity with respect to neuronal activation patterns. Introducing a shorter HRF time-to-peak leads to a more reliable grouping of all four semantic classes, despite contextual factors. These data might give novel insights into the neuronal representation of complex stimuli and may enable further research in ontology validation in cognition-enabled robotics."

Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain diseases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnostic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis."

Experiments indicate that MindAligner not only outperforms existing methods in visual decoding under data-limited conditions, but also provides valuable neuroscience insights in cross-subject functional analysis.

There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO MBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and enlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate the hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function, aimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors."

      "abstract": "Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes in areas with sparse data. This results in a more comprehensive dataset, which enables the estimation of traffic density at the census block level as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution exposure. Our high-resolution spatial data products, rigorously validated, provide a more accurate representation of truck traffic and its environmental and health impacts.

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

To defend against these attacks, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers: safeguards trained on synthetic data, generated by prompting LLMs with natural language rules (i.e., a constitution) specifying permitted and restricted content. In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks.

At stake are key questions about what LLMs are created to do, and by whom: How might a journalist-led LLM work, and what can participatory design illuminate about the present-day challenges about adapting ``one-size-fits-all'' foundation models to a given context of use? In this paper, we undertake a co-design exploration to understand how a participatory approach to LLMs might address opportunities and challenges around AI in journalism.

Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings."

Future experiments, such as MEG II, Mu3e, Mu2e, and COMET, are predicted to significantly improve the sensitivity, testing larger regions of the parameter space.

MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG."

Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain, such as the inspiration of neocognitron, which is the pioneering work of convolutional neural networks. Per the motives of the emerging field: NeuroAI, a great amount of neuroscience knowledge can help catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more powerful capabilities. As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory. In this Primer, we first discuss the preliminaries of biological neuronal diversity and the characteristics of information transmission and processing in a biological neuron. Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "In recent years, the ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a novel cancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy as conventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues. However, due to the limitation of number of particles, achieving FLASH effect in a compact heavy-ion synchrotron requires a short extraction time of tens of milliseconds, which is challenging for conventional RF-KO method. The conventional RF-KO method excites particle amplitudes through local resonance, but the extremely high dose rates required for FLASH therapy necessitate large excitation amplitudes that current driver technologies cannot adequately provide within the required millisecond scale. To address this challenge, this paper introduces autoresonance into resonant extraction for the first time. Leveraging the principles of autoresonance, this technique achieves whole beam amplitude resonance through frequency locking, facilitating rapid and uniform beam extraction using a single-period frequency sweeping excitation. Compared to conventional slow extraction methods, this innovative approach requires only the addition of an octupole magnet. We derived the autoresonance threshold under rapid extraction conditions and conducted some simulations. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that this method can achieve millisecond scale extraction, validating the effectiveness of the proposed Autoresonance Rapid Extraction method."

      "abstract": "Video Camouflaged Object Detection (VCOD) is a challenging task which aims to identify objects that seamlessly concealed within the background in videos. The dynamic properties of video enable detection of camouflaged objects through motion cues or varied perspectives. Previous VCOD datasets primarily contain animal objects, limiting the scope of research to wildlife scenarios. However, the applications of VCOD extend beyond wildlife and have significant implications in security, art, and medical fields. Addressing this problem, we construct a new large-scale multi-domain VCOD dataset MSVCOD. To achieve high-quality annotations, we design a semi-automatic iterative annotation pipeline that reduces costs while maintaining annotation accuracy. Our MSVCOD is the largest VCOD dataset to date, introducing multiple object categories including human, animal, medical, and vehicle objects for the first time, while also expanding background diversity across various environments. This expanded scope increases the practical applicability of the VCOD task in camouflaged object detection. Alongside this dataset, we introduce a one-steam video camouflage object detection model that performs both feature extraction and information fusion without additional motion feature fusion modules. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the existing VCOD animal dataset and the proposed MSVCOD. The dataset and code will be made publicly available."

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various clinical applications. A major challenge in medical image segmentation is achieving accurate delineation of regions of interest in the presence of noise, low contrast, or complex anatomical structures. Existing segmentation models often neglect the integration of multi-grained information and fail to preserve edge details, which are critical for precise segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel image semantic segmentation model called the Multi-Grained Feature Integration Network (MGFI-Net). Our MGFI-Net is designed with two dedicated modules to tackle these issues. First, to enhance segmentation accuracy, we introduce a Multi-Grained Feature Extraction Module, which leverages hierarchical relationships between different feature scales to selectively focus on the most relevant information. Second, to preserve edge details, we incorporate an Edge Enhancement Module that effectively retains and integrates boundary information to refine segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGFI-Net not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy but also achieves superior time efficiency, establishing it as a leading solution for real-time medical image segmentation."

      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal models are pivotal in the domains of rehabilitation and resistance training to analyze muscle conditions. However, individual variability in musculoskeletal parameters and the immeasurability of some internal biomechanical variables pose significant obstacles to accurate personalized modelling. Furthermore, muscle activation estimation can be challenging due to the inherent redundancy of the musculoskeletal system, where multiple muscles drive a single joint. This study develops a whole-body musculoskeletal model for strength and conditioning training and calibrates relevant muscle parameters with an electromyography-based optimization method. By utilizing the personalized musculoskeletal model, muscle activation can be subsequently estimated to analyze the performance of exercises. Bench press and deadlift are chosen for experimental verification to affirm the efficacy of this approach."

      "abstract": "Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to evaluate the functional significance of coronary stenosis by analyzing low-level radiomic features of the pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) surrounding the lesions, which are indicative of its inflammation status. Methods: A dataset of 72 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was analyzed, with 3D segmentation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations from a prior study. Centerlines of the main epicardial branches were automatically extracted, and lesions identified using Gaussian kernel regression to estimate healthy branch caliber. PCAT features were computed per vessel following guideline recommendations and per lesion within a region extending radially for two vessel radii. Features like fat volume and mean attenuation (FAI) were analyzed for their relationship with CFD-derived hemodynamic biomarkers, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) and wall shear stress (WSS). These features also informed a machine learning (ML) model for classifying potentially ischemic lesions. Results: PCAT exhibited, on average, higher attenuation in the presence of hemodynamically significant lesions (i.e., FFR < 0.80), although this difference was of limited statistical significance. The ML classifier, trained on PCAT features, successfully distinguished potentially ischemic lesions, yielding average accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion: PCAT attenuation is correlated with the functional status of coronary stenosis and can be used to inform ML models for predicting potential ischemia. Significance: PCAT features, readily available from CCTA, can be used to predict the hemodynamic characteristics of a lesion without the need for an invasive FFR examination."

      "abstract": "Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data such as lab test results capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative embeddings. These embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."

This study investigates how explicitly injecting medical knowledge into the learning process affects the performance of cross-modality classification, focusing on Chest X-ray (CXR) images. We introduce a novel Set Theory-based knowledge injection framework that generates captions for CXR images with controllable knowledge granularity. Using this framework, we fine-tune CLIP model on captions with varying levels of medical information. We evaluate the model's performance through zero-shot classification on the CheXpert dataset, a benchmark for CXR classification. Our results demonstrate that injecting fine-grained medical knowledge substantially improves classification accuracy, achieving 72.5\\% compared to 49.9\\% when using human-generated captions. This highlights the crucial role of domain-specific knowledge in medical cross-modality learning. Furthermore, we explore the influence of knowledge density and the use of domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) for caption generation, finding that denser knowledge and specialized LLMs contribute to enhanced performance. This research advances medical image analysis by demonstrating the effectiveness of knowledge injection for improving automated CXR classification, paving the way for more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools."

      "abstract": "Medical question answering requires extensive access to specialized conceptual knowledge. The current paradigm, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), acquires expertise medical knowledge through large-scale corpus retrieval and uses this knowledge to guide a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for generating answers. However, existing retrieval approaches often overlook the importance of factual knowledge, which limits the relevance of retrieved conceptual knowledge and restricts its applicability in real-world scenarios, such as clinical decision-making based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This paper introduces RGAR, a recurrence generation-augmented retrieval framework that retrieves both relevant factual and conceptual knowledge from dual sources (i.e., EHRs and the corpus), allowing them to interact and refine each another. Through extensive evaluation across three factual-aware medical question answering benchmarks, RGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance among medical RAG systems. Notably, the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with RGAR surpasses the considerably larger, RAG-enhanced GPT-3.5. Our findings demonstrate the benefit of extracting factual knowledge for retrieval, which consistently yields improved generation quality."
