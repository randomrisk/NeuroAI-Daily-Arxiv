      "abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become a new paradigm in computer networking, introducing a decoupled architecture that separates the network into the data plane and the control plane. The control plane acts as the centralized brain, managing configuration updates and network management tasks, while the data plane handles traffic based on the configurations provided by the control plane. Given its asynchronous distributed nature, SDN can experience data races due to message passing between the control and data planes. This paper presents Tracer, a tool designed to automatically detect and explain the occurrence of data races in DyNetKAT SDN models. DyNetKAT is a formal framework for modeling and analyzing SDN behaviors, with robust operational semantics and a complete axiomatization implemented in Maude. Built on NetKAT, a language leveraging Kleene Algebra with Tests to express data plane forwarding behavior, DyNetKAT extends these capabilities by adding primitives for communication between the control and data planes. Tracer exploits the DyNetKAT axiomatization and enables race detection in SDNs based on Lamport vector clocks. Tracer is a publicly available tool."

In this study, we utilized two SPECT data sets (n = 634 and n = 202) from different hospitals to develop a model capable of accurately predicting PD stages, a multiclass classification task. We used the entire three-dimensional (3D) brain images as input and experimented with various model architectures. Initially, we treated the 3D images as sequences of two-dimensional (2D) slices and fed them sequentially into 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) models pretrained on ImageNet, averaging the outputs to obtain the final predicted stage. We also applied 3D CNN models pretrained on Kinetics-400. Additionally, we incorporated an attention mechanism to account for the varying importance of different slices in the prediction process. To further enhance model efficacy and robustness, we simultaneously trained the two data sets using weight sharing, a technique known as cotraining. Our results demonstrated that 2D models pretrained on ImageNet outperformed 3D models pretrained on Kinetics-400, and models utilizing the attention mechanism outperformed both 2D and 3D models. The cotraining technique proved effective in improving model performance when the cotraining data sets were sufficiently large."

However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies."

      "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical tool for diagnosing tumors and neurological disorders but poses radiation risks to patients, particularly to sensitive populations. While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance."

      "abstract": "The 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) is a newly defined folding pattern, which is the conjunction of gyri coming from three directions in cortical folding. Many studies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain networks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and individuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs are identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to directly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject correspondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of brain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods tend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully respected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the correspondences among different brains. The core component of this framework is to construct a structural similarity-enhanced multi-hop feature encoding strategy based on the recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for anatomical feature embedding. Extensive experiments suggest that our approach can effectively establish robust cross-subject correspondences when no one-to-one mapping exists."

Deep learning has shown promise in capturing these intricate representations. However, the limited availability of large datasets, especially for disease-specific groups such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), constrains the generalizability of deep learning models. In this study, we focus on multivariate time series forecasting of independent component networks derived from rs-fMRI as a form of data augmentation, using both a conventional LSTM-based model and the novel Transformer-based BrainLM model.

While scale invariance and non-Gaussian dynamics - hallmarks of criticality - have been observed in brain activity, a direct link between criticality and behavioural performance remains unexplored. Here, we use a phenomenological renormalisation group (PRG) approach to examine neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of mice performing a visual recognition task. We show that non-trivial scaling in neuronal activity is associated with enhanced task performance, with pronounced scaling observed during successful task completion. When rewards were removed or non-natural stimuli presented, these scaling signatures diminished. These results suggest that critical dynamics in the brain may be crucial for optimising behavioural outcomes, offering new insights into the functional role of criticality in cortical processing."

Specifically, we go through large-scale brain network models relevant to AD and PD, highlighting the pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies investigated in the literature. Additionally, we investigate the propagation of CSD in the brain and its implications for neurological disorders.

It is usually defined as the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which causes both motor and non-motor symptoms. Understanding the neuronal processes that underlie PD is critical for creating successful therapies. This study combines machine learning (ML), stochastic modelling, and Bayesian inference with connectomic data to analyze the brain networks involved in PD. We use modern computational methods to study large-scale neural networks to identify neuronal activity patterns related to PD development. We aim to define the subtle structural and functional connection changes in PD brains by combining connectomic with stochastic noises. Stochastic modelling approaches reflect brain dynamics' intrinsic variability and unpredictability, shedding light on the origin and spread of pathogenic events in PD. We employ a novel hybrid model to assess how stochastic noise impacts the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CBGTH) network, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Bayesian inference allows us to quantify uncertainty in model parameters, improving the accuracy of our predictions. Our findings reveal that stochastic disturbances increase thalamus activity, even under deep brain stimulation (DBS). Bayesian analysis suggests that reducing these disturbances could enhance healthy brain states, providing insights for potential therapeutic interventions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of PD dynamics and paves the way for personalized treatment strategies. This is an extended version of our work presented at the ICCS-2024 conference."

Traditional methods, utilizing medical sensors like EEG and ECG, can be effective but often present challenges such as unnatural user experience, complex deployment, and high costs. Ballistocardiography~(BCG), a type of piezoelectric sensor signal, offers a non-invasive, user-friendly, and easily deployable alternative for long-term home monitoring. However, reliable BCG-based sleep staging is challenging due to the limited sleep monitoring data available for BCG. A restricted training dataset prevents the model from generalization across populations. Additionally, transferring to BCG faces difficulty ensuring model robustness when migrating from other data sources. To address these issues, we introduce SleepNetZero, a zero-shot learning based approach for sleep staging. To tackle the generalization challenge, we propose a series of BCG feature extraction methods that align BCG components with corresponding respiratory, cardiac, and movement channels in PSG. This allows models to be trained on large-scale PSG datasets that are diverse in population. For the migration challenge, we employ data augmentation techniques, significantly enhancing generalizability. We conducted extensive training and testing on large datasets~(12393 records from 9637 different subjects), achieving an accuracy of 0.803 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.718. ZeroSleepNet was also deployed in real prototype~(monitoring pads) and tested in actual hospital settings~(265 users), demonstrating an accuracy of 0.697 and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.589.

Especially collaborative VR applications where different people can work together are gaining momentum. In this context, human avatars and their representations are a crucial aspect of collaborative VR applications as they represent a digital twin of the end-users and determine how one is perceived in a virtual environment. When it comes to the effect of avatar representation on the end-users of collaborative VR applications, so far mostly questionnaires have been used to assess the quality of avatar representations. A promising alternative to objectively measure the effect of avatar representation is the investigation of inter-brain connections during the usage of a collaborative VR application. However, the combination of immersive VR applications and inter-brain connections has not been fully researched yet. Thus, our work investigates how different human avatar representations (real (RL), full-body (FB), and head-hand (HH)) affect inter-brain connections. For this purpose, we have designed and conducted a hyperscanning study with eight pairs. The main results of our hyperscanning study show that the number of significant sensor pairs was the highest in the RL, medium in the FB, and lowest in the HH condition indicating that an avatar that looks more like a real human enables more significant sensor pairs to appear in an EEG analysis."

The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions.

Results indicate that the SVM classifier successfully distinguished between the three-word categories, with significant differences in neural activity ascribed to the late positive potential mainly detected in the central-parietal-occipital and anterior right scalp areas in the time windows of 450-649 ms and 650-850 ms. These findings were in line with the established distribution pattern of the late positive potential. Intriguingly, the study also revealed that word categories were still detectable in the regulate condition. This study extends previous results on the domain of the cortical responses of taboo words, and how machine learning methods can be used to predict word categories from EEG responses."

      "abstract": "The integration of the Metaverse into a human-centric ecosystem has intensified the need for sophisticated Human Digital Twins (HDTs) that are driven by the multifaceted human data. However, the effective construction of HDTs faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity of data collection devices, the high energy demands associated with processing intricate data, and concerns over the privacy of sensitive information. This work introduces a novel biologically-inspired (bio-inspired) HDT framework that leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensor technology to capture brain signals as the data source for constructing HDT. By collecting and analyzing these signals, the framework not only minimizes device heterogeneity and enhances data collection efficiency, but also provides richer and more nuanced physiological and psychological data for constructing personalized HDTs. To this end, we further propose a bio-inspired neuromorphic computing learning model based on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). This model utilizes discrete neural spikes to emulate the way of human brain processes information, thereby enhancing the system's ability to process data effectively while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we integrate a Federated Learning (FL) strategy within the model to strengthen data privacy. We then conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance of our proposed twofold bio-inspired scheme. Finally, we present several challenges and promising directions for future research of HDTs driven by bio-inspired technologies."

The P300 speller brain computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication medium by leveraging a subject's EEG response to characters traditionally highlighted on a character grid on a graphical user interface (GUI). A recurring theme in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster subject interaction. This study builds on that theme by addressing key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and by integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Furthermore, various advanced large language models such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2), BERT, and BART, alongside Dijkstra's algorithm, are utilized to optimize stimuli and provide word completion choices based on the spelling history. In addition, a multi-layered smoothing approach is applied to allow for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. By conducting extensive simulations based on randomly sampled EEG data from subjects, we show substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, with the extent of improvement varying depending on the language model utilized. The gains through such character-level interface optimizations are approximately 10%, and GPT2 for multi-word prediction provides gains of around 40%. In particular, some large language models achieve performance levels within 10% of the theoretical performance limits established in this study. In addition, both within and across subjects, training techniques are explored, and speed improvements are shown to hold in both cases.",

This study explores advanced classification techniques leveraging interpretable fuzzy transfer learning (iFuzzyTL) to enhance the adaptability and performance of SSVEP-based systems. Recent efforts have strengthened to reduce calibration requirements through innovative transfer learning approaches, which refine cross-subject generalizability and minimize calibration through strategic application of domain adaptation and few-shot learning strategies. Pioneering developments in deep learning also offer promising enhancements, facilitating robust domain adaptation and significantly improving system responsiveness and accuracy in SSVEP classification.

This approach bolsters the model's precision and aligns with real-world operational demands by effectively managing the inherent variability and uncertainty of EEG data.

Synchronous data was collected using 31-channel EEG and IMU-based motion capture systems for nine healthy participants while performing left-turn, right-turn, and straight walk movements. EEG data was preprocessed with steps including Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), re-referencing, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove data noise. Feature extraction from the preprocessed EEG data involved computing various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis), and Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity). Further, the feature selection was performed using the Random forest algorithm for the dimensionality reduction. The feature set obtained was utilized for 3-class classification using XG boost, gradient boosting, and support vector machine (SVM) with RBF kernel classifiers in a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Using the proposed intention detection methodology, the SVM classifier using an EEG window of 1.5 s and 0 s time-lag has the best decoding performance with mean accuracy, precision, and recall of 81.23%, 85.35%, and 83.92%, respectively, across the nine participants.

However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning."

The present study offers a detailed analysis of topological changes associated with MCI, focusing on two subtypes: Early MCI and Late MCI. This analysis utilizes fMRI time series data from two distinct populations: the publicly available ADNI dataset (Western cohort) and the in-house TLSA dataset (Indian Urban cohort). Persistent Homology, a topological data analysis method, is employed with two distinct filtration techniques - Vietoris-Rips and graph filtration-for classifying MCI subtypes. For Vietoris-Rips filtration, inter-ROI Wasserstein distance matrices between persistent diagrams are used for classification, while graph filtration relies on the top ten most persistent homology features. Comparative analysis shows that the Vietoris-Rips filtration significantly outperforms graph filtration, capturing subtle variations in brain connectivity with greater accuracy. The Vietoris-Rips filtration method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 85.7\\% for distinguishing between age and gender matched healthy controls and MCI, whereas graph filtration reached a maximum accuracy of 71.4\\% for the same task. This superior performance highlights the sensitivity of Vietoris-Rips filtration in detecting intricate topological features associated with neurodegeneration.

Current studies mostly use linear encoding models for clarity, even though brain responses are often nonlinear. This has sparked interest in developing nonlinear encoding models that are still interpretable. To address this problem, we propose LinBridge, a learnable and flexible framework based on Jacobian analysis for interpreting nonlinear encoding models. LinBridge posits that the nonlinear mapping between ANN representations and neural responses can be factorized into a linear inherent component that approximates the complex nonlinear relationship, and a mapping bias that captures sample-selective nonlinearity. The Jacobian matrix, which reflects output change rates relative to input, enables the analysis of sample-selective mapping in nonlinear models. LinBridge employs a self-supervised learning strategy to extract both the linear inherent component and nonlinear mapping biases from the Jacobian matrices of the test set, allowing it to adapt effectively to various nonlinear encoding models. We validate the LinBridge framework in the scenario of neural visual encoding, using computational visual representations from CLIP-ViT to predict brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the linear inherent component extracted by LinBridge accurately reflects the complex mappings of nonlinear neural encoding models; 2) the sample-selective mapping bias elucidates the variability of nonlinearity across different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. This study presents a novel tool for interpreting nonlinear neural encoding models and offers fresh evidence about hierarchical nonlinearity distribution in the visual cortex."

Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles."

However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures.   The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches.   By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented.

      "abstract": "Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN."

      "abstract": "In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain."

Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy."

Recognizing the untapped potential for cross-pollination and the adaptability of neural signals across varying experimental conditions, we set out to develop a unified model capable of interfacing with multiple modalities.

However, research requiring surgical implants has a number of practical limitations. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first ever application of feature-level, deep learning based harmonization for MEG neuroimaging data. Our analysis additionally offers further evidence of the impact of demographic features on neuroimaging data, demonstrating that participant age strongly affects how machine learning models solve speech decoding tasks using MEG data. Lastly, in the course of this study we produce a new open-source implementation of one of these models to the benefit of the broader scientific community."

In contrast, fMRI scans are acquired directly in brain space, a voxel grid with a typical structured input representation. By using established techniques to reconstruct the sensors' sources' neural activity it is possible to decode from voxels for MEG data as well. We show that this enables spatial inductive biases, spatial data augmentations, better interpretability, zero-shot generalisation between datasets, and data harmonisation."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in decoding language from brain signals (EEG and MEG) have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models, leading to remarkable progress on publicly available non-invasive EEG/MEG datasets. However, previous works predominantly utilize teacher forcing during text generation, leading to significant performance drops without its use. A fundamental issue is the inability to establish a unified feature space correlating textual data with the corresponding evoked brain signals. Although some recent studies attempt to mitigate this gap using an audio-text pre-trained model, Whisper, which is favored for its signal input modality, they still largely overlook the inherent differences between audio signals and brain signals in directly applying Whisper to decode brain signals. To address these limitations, we propose a new multi-stage strategy for semantic brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn, termed BrainECHO. Specifically, BrainECHO successively conducts: 1) Discrete autoencoding of the audio spectrogram; 2) Brain-audio latent space alignment; and 3) Semantic text generation via Whisper finetuning. Through this autoencoding--alignment--finetuning process, BrainECHO outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data split settings on two widely accepted resources: the EEG dataset (Brennan) and the MEG dataset (GWilliams). The innovation of BrainECHO, coupled with its robustness and superiority at the sentence, session, and subject-independent levels across public datasets, underscores its significance for language-based brain-computer interfaces."

Such sensors enable construction of magnetoencephalography (MEG) instrumentation, with significant advantages over conventional MEG devices including adaptability to head size, enhanced movement tolerance, lower complexity and improved data quality. However, realising the potential of OPMs depends on our ability to perform system calibration, which means finding sensor locations, orientations, and the relationship between the sensor output and magnetic field (termed sensor gain). Such calibration is complex in OPMMEG since, for example, OPM placement can change from subject to subject (unlike in conventional MEG where sensor locations or orientations are fixed). Here, we present two methods for calibration, both based on generating well-characterised magnetic fields across a sensor array. Our first device (the HALO) is a head mounted system that generates dipole like fields from a set of coils. Our second (the matrix coil (MC)) generates fields using coils embedded in the walls of a magnetically shielded room. Our results show that both methods offer an accurate means to calibrate an OPM array (e.g. sensor locations within 2 mm of the ground truth) and that the calibrations produced by the two methods agree strongly with each other. When applied to data from human MEG experiments, both methods offer improved signal to noise ratio after beamforming suggesting that they give calibration parameters closer to the ground truth than factory settings and presumed physical sensor coordinates and orientations. Both techniques are practical and easy to integrate into real world MEG applications. This advances the field significantly closer to the routine use of OPMs for MEG recording."

Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training, limiting the number of professionals available to analyze EEG/MEG data.

However, current methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where spikes originate. This paper introduces a novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework designed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL demonstrates superior accuracy in spike detection and channel localization compared to traditional methods. The results show that NDL improves prediction accuracy, supports cross-modality data integration, and can be fine-tuned for various neurophysiological applications."

Various observational and computational methods have been developed to quantify galaxy morphology, and with the advent of large galaxy simulations, the need for automated and effective classification methods has become increasingly important. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as an interpretable dimensionality reduction algorithm for galaxy morphology using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation dataset with the aim of developing a generative model for galaxies. We first generate a dataset of 2D images and 3D cubes of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation, focusing on the mass, metallicity, and stellar age distribution of each galaxy. PCA is then applied to this data, transforming it into a lower-dimensional image space, where closeness of data points corresponds to morphological similarity. We find that PCA can effectively capture the key morphological features of galaxies, with a significant proportion of the variance in the data being explained by a small number of components. With our method we achieve a dimensionality reduction by a factor of $\\sim200$ for 2D images and $\\sim3650$ for 3D cubes at a reconstruction accuracy below five percent. Our results illustrate the potential of PCA in compressing large cosmological simulations into an interpretable generative model for galaxies that can easily be used in various downstream tasks such as galaxy classification and analysis.",

The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases, the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum SEDs of each of the source using either MAGPHYS or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rates of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=1.5^{+1.3}_{-0.8}~M_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$, which leads to more physical values for $f_{\\rm mol}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation, and plot the sample on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to \"enhanced\" star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification.

Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

After reviewing each area, we discuss two possible correspondences implied by this perspective: cortical pyramidal dendrites as analogous to (non-linear) deep networks and lateral inhibition as analogous to normalizing flows. These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a form of distributed learning that allows multiple institutions or clients to collaboratively learn a global model to solve a task. This allows the model to utilize the information from every institute while preserving data privacy. However, recent studies show that the promise of protecting the privacy of data is not upheld by existing methods and that it is possible to recreate the training data from the different institutions. This is done by utilizing gradients transferred between the clients and the global server during training or by knowing the model architecture at the client end. In this paper, we propose a federated learning framework for semantic segmentation without knowing the model architecture nor transferring gradients between the client and the server, thus enabling better privacy preservation. We propose BlackFed - a black-box adaptation of neural networks that utilizes zero order optimization (ZOO) to update the client model weights and first order optimization (FOO) to update the server weights. We evaluate our approach on several computer vision and medical imaging datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first works in employing federated learning for segmentation, devoid of gradients or model information exchange.

      "abstract": "This study is to evaluate the impact of different normal lung volumes on radiation pneumonitis (RP) prediction in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell-lung-cancer (LA-NSCLC) receiving radiotherapy. Three dosimetric variables (V20, V5, and mean lung dose (MLD)) were calculated using treatment plans from 442 patients with LA-NSCLC enrolled in NRG Oncology RTOG 0617. Three lung volumes were defined based on the treatment plan: total lung excluding gross-tumor-target (TL-GTV), total lung excluding clinical-target-volume (TL-CTV), and total lung excluding planning-target-volume (TL-PTV). Binary classification was used for clinical endpoints: no-RP2 (N = 377) for patients with acute RP grades 0 or 1, and RP2 (N = 65) for patients with acute grades 2 or higher. The impact of lung volume definition on RP prediction was investigated with statistical analyses and two supervised machine learning (ML) models: logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Balanced data was generated for comparison to prediction obtained with the imbalanced data. Areas under curve (AUCs) and the Shapley Additive eXplanations (SHAP) were used to examine ML performance and explain the contribution of each feature to the prediction, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed that V20 and MLD were associated with RP but no difference among different lung volume definitions. Mean AUC values from 10-fold cross validation using imbalanced and balanced datasets were < 0.6 except that RF from the latter dataset yielded AUC values > 0.7. SHAP values indicated that MLD and V20 were the most prominent features in RP prediction. In all assessments, no difference among various volume definitions was found. Different lung volumes showed insignificant impact on RP prediction. Low AUC values suggest limited effectiveness of these dosimetric variables in predicting RP risk and more powerful predictors are needed."

      "abstract": "Schema matching -- the task of finding matches between attributes across disparate data sources with different tables and hierarchies -- is critical for creating interoperable machine learning (ML)-ready data. Addressing this fundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains like healthcare, finance and e-commerce -- but also has the potential to benefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model training. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to structural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas. Previous ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required significant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or suffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker - a compositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of candidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also self-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations via a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context demonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process. Empirically, we demonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker outperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to accelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data."

      "abstract": "When developing machine learning models, image quality assessment (IQA) measures are a crucial component for evaluation. However, commonly used IQA measures have been primarily developed and optimized for natural images. In many specialized settings, such as medical images, this poses an often-overlooked problem regarding suitability. In previous studies, the IQA measure HaarPSI showed promising behavior for natural and medical images. HaarPSI is based on Haar wavelet representations and the framework allows optimization of two parameters. So far, these parameters have been aligned for natural images. Here, we optimize these parameters for two annotated medical data sets, a photoacoustic and a chest X-Ray data set. We observe that they are more sensitive to the parameter choices than the employed natural images, and on the other hand both medical data sets lead to similar parameter values when optimized. We denote the optimized setting, which improves the performance for the medical images notably, by HaarPSI$_{MED}$. The results suggest that adapting common IQA measures within their frameworks for medical images can provide a valuable, generalizable addition to the employment of more specific task-based measures.",

      "abstract": "This study introduces the Hybrid Multi-modal VGG (HM-VGG) model, a cutting-edge deep learning approach for the early diagnosis of glaucoma. The HM-VGG model utilizes an attention mechanism to process Visual Field (VF) data, enabling the extraction of key features that are vital for identifying early signs of glaucoma. Despite the common reliance on large annotated datasets, the HM-VGG model excels in scenarios with limited data, achieving remarkable results with small sample sizes. The model's performance is underscored by its high metrics in Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score, indicating its potential for real-world application in glaucoma detection. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with ophthalmic image analysis, particularly the difficulty of obtaining large volumes of annotated data. It highlights the importance of moving beyond single-modality data, such as VF or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images alone, to a multimodal approach that can provide a richer, more comprehensive dataset. This integration of different data types is shown to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. The HM- VGG model offers a promising tool for doctors, streamlining the diagnostic process and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, its applicability extends to telemedicine and mobile healthcare, making diagnostic services more accessible. The research presented in this paper is a significant step forward in the field of medical image processing and has profound implications for clinical ophthalmology."

This study aims to detect significant indicators of early AD by extracting and integrating various imaging biomarkers, including radiomics, hippocampal texture descriptors, cortical thickness measurements, and deep learning features. We analyze structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts, utilizing comprehensive image analysis and machine learning techniques. Our results show that combining multiple biomarkers significantly improves detection accuracy. Radiomics and texture features emerged as the most effective predictors for early AD, achieving AUCs of 0.88 and 0.72 for AD and MCI detection, respectively. Although deep learning features proved to be less effective than traditional approaches, incorporating age with other biomarkers notably enhanced MCI detection performance. Additionally, our findings emphasize the continued importance of classical imaging biomarkers in the face of modern deep-learning approaches, providing a robust framework for early AD diagnosis."

We evaluate six LLMs for query generation, focusing on open-source and relatively small models that require minimal computational resources. Our evaluation includes two closed-source and four open-source models, with one specifically trained in the medical field and five general-purpose models. We compare the retrieval effectiveness achieved by LLM-generated queries against those created by medical experts and state-of-the-art methods from the literature. Our findings indicate that the evaluated models reach retrieval effectiveness on par with or greater than expert-created queries. The LLMs consistently outperform standard baselines and other approaches in the literature. The best performing LLMs exhibit fast response times, ranging from 1.7 to 8 seconds, and generate a manageable number of query terms (15-63 on average), making them suitable for practical implementation. Our overall findings suggest that leveraging small, open-source LLMs for clinical trials retrieval can balance performance, computational efficiency, and real-world applicability in medical settings."
