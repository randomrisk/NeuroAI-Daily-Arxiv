      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis, and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction. Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its capacity for robust performance across clinical applications. We release our code and model publicly at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/SSL-AD.",

In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used to analyze data from brain recordings. Our introduction of near-Hamiltonian descriptions of neuronal activity could permit the application of highly developed physics theory to get insight into brain behavior.",

      "abstract": "Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance - particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study, we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to 140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%) across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced volumetric variability.",

Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth restriction).   Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.   Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming baseline models.   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.

In a preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study, we evaluated alpha upregulation in healthy participants receiving either genuine or sham EEG-NF during a single-session design. A third arm composed of a passive control group was also included to differentiate between non-specific influences related or not to the active engagement in EEG-NF. Throughout the session, alpha power increased robustly, yet independently of feedback veracity, engagement in self-regulation, or feedback update frequency. Parallel increases in theta and sensorimotor rhythms further suggest broadband non-specific modulation.

We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration, mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results: Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data. Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without increasing complexity.

Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic test device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball impacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in measuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The headband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins, goal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and peak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented mouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in the field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the headband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest agreement for angular velocities (0.79 \\pm 0.08) and translational accelerations (0.73 \\pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \\pm 0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and mouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading) for the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1% for the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the instrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some kinematic measures and impact conditions.

The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance.

The first signals the passage from independent diffusion to a swap-dominated regime where the particles act as identical random walkers swapping positions. The second crossover occurs when both channels become indistinguishable and the walkers move around the same position. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a persistent spatial anisotropy defined by the difference between the second moments of the probability distributions in the two channels. Our results may provide a quantitative framework to understand diverse systems. In biology, it is motivated by motor proteins (kinesin/dynein) exchanging cargo leadership, membrane receptors swapping binding partners, or brain synapses with activity-dependent plasticity.

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical challenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can significantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially leading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods have been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human experts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG recordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors across multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in specificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation Forest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most comparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact cleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop, highlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time applications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution for high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical neuroimaging applications.",

This work highlights the potential of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations. Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the strengths of pre-trained language models.

      "abstract": "Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation. Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's prosocial development.",

Specifically, since the discrete time series of phase can be regarded as a functional observation taking values on circle, we employ a Bayesian model for circular-variate functional data, which gives denoising and inference on the resulting PLV values. The proposed model is defined through \"wrapping\" functional Gaussian models on real line, for which we develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm using Gibbs sampler.

To develop measurable variables aligned with this framework, we introduce \"feelings of agency\" (FoA) as an alternative to the established construct of \"sense of agency\" (SoA), refining Synofzyk's multifactorial weighting model and offering a novel conceptual pathway for overcoming gaps in the dominant comparator model. We define FoA as comprising two subconstructs: affective engagement and volitional attention, which we operationalize through integrated neurodynamic indicators (valence, arousal, cross frequency coupling within the dorsal attention system) and first-person phenomenological reports. We argue that these neurophenomenological indicators provide richer, more actionable insights for digital affordance design, particularly in XR, BCI, Human AI Interaction (HAX), and generative AI environments.

This study introduces NeuroGaze, a hybrid interface combining electroencephalography (EEG) with eye tracking to enable hands-free interaction in immersive VR. Twenty participants completed a 360{\\deg} cube-selection task using three different input methods: VR controllers, gaze combined with a pinch gesture, and NeuroGaze. Performance was measured by task completion time and error rate, while workload was evaluated using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). NeuroGaze successfully supported target selection with off-the-shelf hardware, producing fewer errors than the alternative methods but requiring longer completion times, reflecting a classic speed-accuracy tradeoff. Workload analysis indicated reduced physical demand for NeuroGaze compared to controllers, though overall ratings and user preferences were mixed. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid EEG+gaze systems for everyday VR use, highlighting their ergonomic benefits and inclusivity potential. Although not yet competitive in speed, NeuroGaze points toward a practical role for consumer-grade BCIs in accessibility and long-duration applications, and underscores the need for improved EEG signal processing and adaptive multimodal integration to enhance future performance.",

To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the 26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific patterns in the dataset.

However, the current transfer learning model greatly depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\\%, 68.11\\% and 61.08\\%, respectively.

Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model.

It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\\%, 59.88\\%, and 59.56\\%, respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for each paradigm.

This model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant information, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in specific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal set of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the cognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that allow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal component, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely to be concentrated in components explaining greater variance.

We apply the models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and emotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity ranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification performance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\\% improvement in cross-validated deviance $R^2$ and 7.3\\% improvement in cross-validated AUC.

To overcome this, we introduce a data-driven framework in which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learns the macroscopic dynamics directly from simulations of a network of spiking neurons. The network connection probability serves here as a new parameter, inaccessible to purely analytical treatment, which is validated against ground truth analytical solutions. Through bifurcation analysis on the trained MLP, we demonstrate the existence of new cusp bifurcation that systematically reshapes the system's phase diagram in a degenerate manner with synaptic coupling. By integrating this data-driven mean-field model into a whole-brain computational framework, we show that it extends beyond the macroscopic emergent dynamics generated by the analytical model. For validation, we use simulation-based inference on synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and demonstrate accurate parameter recovery for the novel mean-field model, while the current state-of-the-art models lead to biased estimates. This work presents a flexible and generic framework for building more realistic whole-brain models, bridging the gap between microscale mechanisms and macroscopic brain recordings.",

To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

However, the factors that drive this brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model, training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers (DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics. We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type - independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics. In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training: models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual world.",

To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem.

Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation.

However, OPM-MEG has so far lagged conventional-MEG in terms of the number of independent measurements of magnetic field that can be made across the scalp (i.e. the number of channels). This is important since increasing channel count offers improvements in sensitivity, spatial resolution and coverage. Unfortunately, increasing channel count also poses significant technical and practical challenges. Here, we describe a new OPM-MEG array which exploits triaxial sensors and integrated miniaturised electronic control units to measure MEG data from up to 384 channels. We also introduce a high-speed calibration method to ensure the that the fields measured by this array are high fidelity. The system was validated using a phantom, with results showing that dipole localisation accuracy is better than 1 mm, and correlation between the measured magnetic fields and a dipole model is >0.998. We then demonstrate utility in human MEG acquisition: via measurement of visual gamma oscillations we demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity that are afforded by high channel density, and via a moviewatching paradigm we quantify improvements in spatial resolution. In sum, we show the first OPM-MEG system with a channel count larger than that of typical conventional MEG devices.

The global Wasserstein-Fr\\'echet regression model incorporating covariates (age and gender) allows us to directly compare the distributional patterns between healthy control subjects and mTBI patients. The classification procedure computes Wasserstein distances between estimated quantile functions from control and patient groups, respectively. These distances are then used as the basis for diagnostic decisions. This framework offers a statistically principled approach to improving diagnostic accuracy in mTBI detection.

While the observed power-law decays in empirical data are broadly consistent with turbulent cascades, variations across studies, such as the presence of dual decay rates or harmonic structures, point to a diversity of underlying mechanisms.

In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways.

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning.

Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations.",

Here, the thermal imager is an effective tool for demonstrating the surface temperature distribution. We have studied how the observed infrared image relates to the distribution and change of the thermal field in depth.

It was revealed that with a modeled vessel in the low-temperature exposure zone, the surface thermal fields deformed and they gained the shape of butterfly wings. Our experimental study in a gel phantom is supported by numerical calculations, demonstrating how the freezing zone and thermal isotherms on the surface and in depth evolve under real conditions, thereby providing a basis for assessing the cryoeffect time and intensity in practice.

Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

However, the clinical understanding of CA remains limited due to the intricate structure of the cerebral vasculature and the challenges in accurately quantifying the hemodynamic and physiological parameters that govern this autoregulatory process. Method: In this study, we introduced a novel numerical algorithm that employs three partial differential equations and one ordinary differential equation to capture both the spatial and temporal distributions of key CA-driving factors, including the arterial pressure (P) and the partial pressures of oxygen (PO_2) and carbon dioxide (PCO_2) within the cerebral vasculature, together with a Windkessel model in turn to regulate the CBF based on the calculated P, PO_2, and PCO_2. This algorithm was sequentially integrated with our previously developed personalized 0D-1D multi-dimensional model to account for the patient-specific effects. Results: The integrated framework was rigorously validated using two independent datasets, demonstrating its high reliability and accuracy in capturing the regulatory effects of CA on CBF across a range of physiological conditions.

      "abstract": "Intercurrent events, such as treatment switching, rescue medication, or truncation by death, can complicate the interpretation of intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses in randomized clinical trials. Recent advances in causal inference address these challenges by targeting alternative estimands, such as hypothetical estimands or principal stratum estimands (e.g., survivor average causal effects). However, such approaches often require strong, unverifiable assumptions, partly due to limited data on time-varying confounders and the difficulty of adjusting for them. Additionally, strict trial protocols frequently lead to (near) violations of the positivity assumption, resulting in limited information for identifying these estimands.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach that sidesteps these difficulties by focusing on testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect in the presence of arbitrary intercurrent events, including truncation by death, using longitudinal trial data. Our key idea is to compare treated and untreated individuals, matched on baseline covariates, at the most recent time point before either experiences an intercurrent event. We refer to such contrasts as Pairwise Last Observation Time (PLOT) estimands. These estimands can be identified in randomized clinical trials without requiring additional structural assumptions, and even in the presence of the aforementioned positivity violations. However, they may still be susceptible to a form of residual selection bias. We show that this bias vanishes under the conditions typically required by alternative methods, and find it to be more generally small in extensive simulation studies. Building on this, we develop asymptotically efficient, model-free tests using data-adaptive estimation of nuisance parameters. We evaluate the method's performance via simulation studies.",
