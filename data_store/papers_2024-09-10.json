      "abstract": "Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people with paraplegia by restoring their ability to perform daily activities. However, current iBMIs suffer from scalability and mobility limitations due to bulky hardware and wiring. Wireless iBMIs offer a solution but are constrained by a limited data rate. To overcome this challenge, we are investigating hybrid spiking neural networks for embedded neural decoding in wireless iBMIs. The networks consist of a temporal convolution-based compression followed by recurrent processing and a final interpolation back to the original sequence length. As recurrent units, we explore gated recurrent units (GRUs), leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, and a combination of both - spiking GRUs (sGRUs) and analyze their differences in terms of accuracy, footprint, and activation sparsity. To that end, we train decoders on the \"Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology\" dataset and evaluate it using the NeuroBench framework, targeting both tracks of the IEEE BioCAS Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Our approach achieves high accuracy in predicting velocities of primate reaching movements from multichannel primary motor cortex recordings while maintaining a low number of synaptic operations, surpassing the current baseline models in the NeuroBench framework. This work highlights the potential of hybrid neural networks to facilitate wireless iBMIs with high decoding precision and a substantial increase in the number of monitored neurons, paving the way toward more advanced neuroprosthetic technologies."

We inform the AI practitioner about the human visual system with an extensive literature review; we propose a novel biologically motivated neural network for image classification; and, finally, we present a new plug-and-play module to model context awareness. We focus on the effect of incorporating circuit motifs found in biological brains to address visual recognition. Our convolutional architecture is inspired by the connectivity of human cortical and subcortical streams, and we implement bottom-up and top-down modulations that mimic the extensive afferent and efferent connections between visual and cognitive areas. Our Contextual Attention Block is simple and effective and can be integrated with any feed-forward neural network. It infers weights that multiply the feature maps according to their causal influence on the scene, modeling the co-occurrence of different objects in the image. We place our module at different bottlenecks to infuse a hierarchical context awareness into the model. We validated our proposals through image classification experiments on benchmark data and found a consistent improvement in performance and the robustness of the produced explanations via class activation.

We propose a new deep learning framework (CISCA) for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices to support detailed morphological and structural analysis or straightforward cell counting in digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture studies. At the core of CISCA lies a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The network outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately yields the segmentation of individual cells. A third head enables simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We showcase the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H\\&E datasets. Additionally, we introduce CytoDArk0, a novel dataset consisting of Nissl-stained images of the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus from mammals belonging to the orders Cetartiodactyla and Primates. We evaluate CISCA in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating CISCA's robustness and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques."

However, most studies struggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks, limiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a novel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by utilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask learning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the spectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture is used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit different generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To address this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously regulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task based on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six benchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent and -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification results show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering promising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. By decomposing rs-fMRI signals using DWT, our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Graph theory provides a robust mathematical framework to analyze these complex networks, while machine learning is employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function."

NBTU utilizes a high-frequency alternating electric field to excite a piezoelectric transducer, generating acoustic waves that cause localized heating and tumor cell ablation, and it provides a more precise ablation by delivering lower acoustic power doses directly to targeted tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Building on our previous work, this study introduces a database for optimizing pre-operative surgical planning by simulating ablation effects in varied tissue environments and develops an extended simulation model incorporating various tumor types and sizes to evaluate thermal damage under trans-tissue conditions. A comprehensive database is created from these simulations, detailing critical parameters such as CEM43 isodose maps, temperature changes, thermal dose areas, and maximum ablation distances for four directional probes. This database serves as a valuable resource for future studies, aiding in complex trajectory planning and parameter optimization for NBTU procedures. Moreover, a novel probe selection method is proposed to enhance pre-surgical planning, providing a strategic approach to selecting probes that maximize therapeutic efficiency and minimize ablation time. By avoiding unnecessary thermal propagation and optimizing probe angles, this method has the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline surgical procedures. Overall, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the field of NBTU, offering a robust framework for enhancing treatment precision and efficacy in clinical settings."

Specifically, DECAN employs two parameter-sharing deep neural networks to extract task-relevant representations of dry and wet electrode signals, and then integrates a representation-consistent contrastive loss to minimize the distance between representations from the same timestamp and category but different devices. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we construct an emotion dataset consisting of paired dry and wet electrode EEG signals from 16 subjects with 5 emotions, named PaDWEED. Results on PaDWEED show that DECAN achieves an average accuracy increase of 6.94$\\%$ comparing to state-of-the art performance in emotion recognition of dry electrodes. Ablation studies demonstrate a decrease in inter-class aliasing along with noteworthy accuracy enhancements in the delta and beta frequency bands.

      "abstract": "Surface-based analysis of the cerebral cortex is ubiquitous in human neuroimaging with MRI. It is crucial for cortical registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation. Traditionally, these analyses require high-resolution, isotropic scans with good gray-white matter contrast, typically a 1mm T1-weighted scan. This excludes most clinical MRI scans, which are often anisotropic and lack the necessary T1 contrast. To enable large-scale neuroimaging studies using vast clinical data, we introduce recon-all-clinical, a novel method for cortical reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation in brain MRI scans of any resolution and contrast. Our approach employs a hybrid analysis method that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with domain randomization to predict signed distance functions (SDFs) and classical geometry processing for accurate surface placement while maintaining topological and geometric constraints. The method does not require retraining for different acquisitions, thus simplifying the analysis of heterogeneous clinical datasets. We tested recon-all-clinical on multiple datasets, including over 19,000 clinical scans. The method consistently produced precise cortical reconstructions and high parcellation accuracy across varied MRI contrasts and resolutions. Cortical thickness estimates are precise enough to capture aging effects independently of MRI contrast, although accuracy varies with slice thickness. Our method is publicly available at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-all-clinical, enabling researchers to perform detailed cortical analysis on the huge amounts of already existing clinical MRI scans. This advancement may be particularly valuable for studying rare diseases and underrepresented populations where research-grade MRI data is scarce."

Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks. Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned. In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset. This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures."

In this work, we study the sensitivity of pupillometry-based cognitive load estimation to light. By collecting heart rate variability (HRV) data during the same experimental sessions, we analyze how the multimodal data reduces this sensitivity and increases robustness to light conditions. In addition to this, we compared the performance in multimodal settings using the HRV data obtained from low-cost fitness-grade equipment to that from clinical-grade equipment by synchronously collecting data from both devices for all task conditions. Our results indicate that multimodal data improves the robustness of cognitive load estimation under changes in light conditions and improves the accuracy by more than 20% points over assessment based on pupillometry alone.

To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively.

However, the cost of the equipment and trained staff are generally huge. Moreover, most systems are only trained for a specific mental disorder and are not general-purpose. Recently, physiological studies have shown that there are some speech and facial-related symptoms in a few mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD). In this paper, we focus on the emotional expression features of mental disorders and introduce a multimodal mental disorder diagnosis system based on audio-visual information input.

We retrospectively examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in 15 subjects that underwent ASM tapering during pre-surgical monitoring.

In each subject, we identified seizures that followed the same onset and initial spread patterns, but some seizures terminated early (truncated seizures), and other seizures continued to spread (continuing seizures). We compared ASM concentrations at the times of truncated seizures and continuing seizures.   We found no substantial difference between ASM concentrations when truncated vs. continuing seizures occurred (Mean difference = 4%, sd = 29%, p=0.6).   Our results indicate that ASM did not appear to halt established seizures in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand how ASM may modulate seizure duration and severity."

However, most studies struggle to identify discriminative patterns across subjects during MI tasks, limiting MI classification performance. In this article, we propose MixNet, a novel classification framework designed to overcome this limitation by utilizing spectral-spatial signals from MI data, along with a multitask learning architecture named MIN2Net, for classification. Here, the spectral-spatial signals are generated using the filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSPs) method on MI data. Since the multitask learning architecture is used for the classification task, the learning in each task may exhibit different generalization rates and potential overfitting across tasks. To address this issue, we implement adaptive gradient blending, simultaneously regulating multiple loss weights and adjusting the learning pace for each task based on its generalization/overfitting tendencies. Experimental results on six benchmark data sets of different data sizes demonstrate that MixNet consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms in subject-dependent and -independent settings. Finally, the low-density EEG MI classification results show that MixNet outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms, offering promising implications for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages.",

Nevertheless, existing dry and wet electrodes are difficult to balance between high signal-to-noise ratio and portability in EEG recording, which limits the practical use of BCI. In this study, we propose a Denoising Encoder via Contrastive Alignment Network (DECAN) for dry electrode EEG, under the assumption of the EEG representation consistency between wet and dry electrodes during the same task. Specifically, DECAN employs two parameter-sharing deep neural networks to extract task-relevant representations of dry and wet electrode signals, and then integrates a representation-consistent contrastive loss to minimize the distance between representations from the same timestamp and category but different devices. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we construct an emotion dataset consisting of paired dry and wet electrode EEG signals from 16 subjects with 5 emotions, named PaDWEED. Results on PaDWEED show that DECAN achieves an average accuracy increase of 6.94$\\%$ comparing to state-of-the art performance in emotion recognition of dry electrodes. Ablation studies demonstrate a decrease in inter-class aliasing along with noteworthy accuracy enhancements in the delta and beta frequency bands. Moreover, an inter-subject feature alignment can obtain an accuracy improvement of 5.99$\\%$ and 5.14$\\%$ in intra- and inter-dataset scenarios, respectively.

To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications."

However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm."

However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. By decomposing rs-fMRI signals using DWT, our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Graph theory provides a robust mathematical framework to analyze these complex networks, while machine learning is employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function."

We have examined both (i) ROI-specific inter-subject interactions and (ii) subject-specific inter-ROI interactions. Further, a new deep learning model is proposed for classification, achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 95% for the ADNI dataset and 85% for the in-house dataset.

      "abstract": "Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan."

      "abstract": "Multimodal neuroimaging modeling has becomes a widely used approach but confronts considerable challenges due to heterogeneity, which encompasses variability in data types, scales, and formats across modalities. This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function."

In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture both inter-component and inter-network information. To better handle the FNC data, we develop a new component-specific scanning order. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery."

We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from visual neural networks with varied construction. We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.",

This study evaluates classification techniques using MEG features to distinguish between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment participants from the BioFIND study. We compare MEG based biomarkers with MRI based anatomical features, both independently and combined. We used 3 Tesla MRI and MEG data from 324 BioFIND participants;158 MCI and 166 HC. Analyses were performed using MATLAB with SPM12 and OSL toolboxes. Machine learning analyses, including 100 Monte Carlo replications of 10 fold cross validation, were conducted on sensor and source spaces. Combining MRI with MEG features achieved the best performance; 0.76 accuracy and AUC of 0.82 for GLMNET using LCMV source based MEG. MEG only analyses using LCMV and eLORETA also performed well, suggesting that combining uncorrected MEG with z-score-corrected MRI features is optimal."

In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering."

Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that comprehensively explain neural activity in V1. We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1.

As we know, the human brain has numerous morphologically and functionally different neurons, while artificial neural networks are almost exclusively built on a single neuron type. In the human brain, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of biological intelligent behaviors. Since an artificial network is a miniature of the human brain, introducing neuronal diversity should be valuable in terms of addressing those essential problems of artificial networks such as efficiency, interpretability, and memory.

Then, we review studies of designing new neurons for artificial networks. Next, we discuss what gains can neuronal diversity bring into artificial networks and exemplary applications in several important fields. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions of neuronal diversity to explore the potential of NeuroAI."

      "abstract": "Researchers across cognitive, neuro-, and computer sciences increasingly reference human-like artificial intelligence and neuroAI. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility, or benchmark/engineering goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate, and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests, leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come."

We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities, inherited from over 500 million years of evolution, that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI."

      "abstract": "This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the dark matter of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied."

These connections may provide new directions for further investigations in each field."

For a new understanding of such networks, we study the function spaces induced by sparse random features and characterize what functions may and may not be learned. A network with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive model of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines additive terms of different orders. We identify three specific advantages of sparsity: additive function approximation is a powerful inductive bias that limits the curse of dimensionality, sparse networks are stable to outlier noise in the inputs, and sparse random features are scalable. Thus, even simple brain architectures can be powerful function approximators. Finally, we hope that this work helps popularize kernel theories of networks among computational neuroscientists.",

However, accessing patient data can be challenging due to privacy concerns and strict regulations. Generating synthetic, realistic data offers a potential solution for overcoming these limitations, and recent studies suggest that fine-tuning foundation models can produce such data effectively. In this study, we explore the potential of foundation models for generating realistic medical images, particularly chest x-rays, and assess how their performance improves with fine-tuning. We propose using a Latent Diffusion Model, starting with a pre-trained foundation model and refining it through various configurations. Additionally, we performed experiments with input from a medical professional to assess the realism of the images produced by each trained model."

      "abstract": "The macular pigment (MP) in the radially-oriented Henle fibers that surround the foveola enables the ability to perceive the orientation of polarized blue light through an entoptic phenomena known as the Haidinger's brush. The MP has been linked to eye diseases and central field dysfunctions, most notably age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a globally leading cause of irreversible blindness. Recent integration of structured light techniques into vision science has allowed for the development of more selective and versatile entoptic probes of eye health that provide interpretable thresholds. For example, it enabled the use of variable spatial frequencies and arbitrary obstructions in the presented stimuli. Additionally, it expanded the 2{\\deg} retinal eccentricity extent of the Haidinger's brush to 5{\\deg} for a similar class of fringe-based stimuli. In this work, we develop a spatiotemporal sensitivity model that maps perceptual thresholds of entoptic phenomenon to the underlying MP structure that supports its perception. We therefore selectively characterize the circularly-oriented macular pigment optical density (coMPOD) rather than total MPOD as typically measured, providing an additional quantification of macular health. A study was performed where the retinal eccentricity thresholds were measured for five structured light stimuli with unique spatiotemporal frequencies. The results from fifteen healthy young participants indicate that the coMPOD is inversely proportional to retinal eccentricity in the range of 1.5{\\deg} to 5.5{\\deg}. Good agreement between the model and the collected data is found with a Pearson $\\chi^2$ fit statistic of 0.06. The presented techniques can be applied in novel early diagnostic tests for a variety of diseases related to macular degeneration such as AMD, macular telangiectasia, and pathological myopia."

Accurate diagnosis is essential for ensuring timely and appropriate treatment. This study examines the implementation of deep learning methods to assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions using the HAM10000 dataset, which contains seven distinct types of lesions. First, we evaluated three pre-trained models: MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and VGG11, achieving accuracies of 0.798, 0.802, and 0.805, respectively. To further enhance classification accuracy, we developed ensemble models employing max voting, average voting, and stacking, resulting in accuracies of 0.803, 0.82, and 0.83. Building on the best-performing ensemble learning model, stacking, we developed our proposed model, SkinNet, which incorporates a customized architecture and fine-tuning, achieving an accuracy of 0.867 and an AUC of 0.96. This substantial improvement over individual models demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in improving skin lesion classification."

      "abstract": "Purpose: Medical images acquired using different scanners and protocols can differ substantially in their appearance. This phenomenon, scanner domain shift, can result in a drop in the performance of deep neural networks which are trained on data acquired by one scanner and tested on another. This significant practical issue is well-acknowledged, however, no systematic study of the issue is available across different modalities and diagnostic tasks. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we present a broad experimental study evaluating the impact of scanner domain shift on convolutional neural network performance for different automated diagnostic tasks. We evaluate this phenomenon in common radiological modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. Results: We find that network performance on data from a different scanner is almost always worse than on same-scanner data, and we quantify the degree of performance drop across different datasets. Notably, we find that this drop is most severe for MRI, moderate for X-ray, and quite small for CT, on average, which we attribute to the standardized nature of CT acquisition systems which is not present in MRI or X-ray. We also study how injecting varying amounts of target domain data into the training set, as well as adding noise to the training data, helps with generalization. Conclusion: Our results provide extensive experimental evidence and quantification of the extent of performance drop caused by scanner domain shift in deep learning across different modalities, with the goal of guiding the future development of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis."

      "abstract": "Survival analysis is a branch of statistics used for modeling the time until a specific event occurs and is widely used in medicine, engineering, finance, and many other fields. When choosing survival models, there is typically a trade-off between performance and interpretability, where the highest performance is achieved by black-box models based on deep learning. This is a major problem in fields such as medicine where practitioners are reluctant to blindly trust black-box models to make important patient decisions. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were recently proposed as an interpretable and accurate alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We introduce CoxKAN, a Cox proportional hazards Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for interpretable, high-performance survival analysis. We evaluate the proposed CoxKAN on 4 synthetic datasets and 9 real medical datasets. The synthetic experiments demonstrate that CoxKAN accurately recovers interpretable symbolic formulae for the hazard function, and effectively performs automatic feature selection. Evaluation on the 9 real datasets show that CoxKAN consistently outperforms the Cox proportional hazards model and achieves performance that is superior or comparable to that of tuned MLPs. Furthermore, we find that CoxKAN identifies complex interactions between predictor variables that would be extremely difficult to recognise using existing survival methods, and automatically finds symbolic formulae which uncover the precise effect of important biomarkers on patient risk.",

This includes personal identification information (PII), medical records, legal information, biometric data, and private communications. To protect it from hackers, 'air-gap' measures might be employed. This protective strategy keeps sensitive data in networks entirely isolated (physically and logically) from the Internet. Creating a physical 'air gap' between internal networks and the outside world safeguards sensitive data from theft and online threats. Air-gap networks are relevant today to governmental organizations, healthcare industries, finance sectors, intellectual property and legal firms, and others. In this paper, we dive deep into air-gap security in light of modern cyberattacks and data privacy. Despite this level of protection, publicized incidents from the last decade show that even air-gap networks are not immune to breaches. Motivated and capable adversaries can use sophisticated attack vectors to penetrate the air-gapped networks, leaking sensitive data outward. We focus on different aspects of air gap security. First, we overview cyber incidents that target air-gap networks, including infamous ones such Agent.btz. Second, we introduce the adversarial attack model and different attack vectors attackers may use to compromise air-gap networks. Third, we present the techniques attackers can apply to leak data out of air-gap networks and introduce more innovative ones based on our recent research. Finally, we propose the necessary countermeasures to protect the data, both defensive and preventive."

We propose a new deep learning framework (CISCA) for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices to support detailed morphological and structural analysis or straightforward cell counting in digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture studies. At the core of CISCA lies a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The network outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately yields the segmentation of individual cells. A third head enables simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We showcase the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H\\&E datasets. Additionally, we introduce CytoDArk0, a novel dataset consisting of Nissl-stained images of the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus from mammals belonging to the orders Cetartiodactyla and Primates. We evaluate CISCA in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating CISCA's robustness and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques."

NBTU utilizes a high-frequency alternating electric field to excite a piezoelectric transducer, generating acoustic waves that cause localized heating and tumor cell ablation, and it provides a more precise ablation by delivering lower acoustic power doses directly to targeted tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Building on our previous work, this study introduces a database for optimizing pre-operative surgical planning by simulating ablation effects in varied tissue environments and develops an extended simulation model incorporating various tumor types and sizes to evaluate thermal damage under trans-tissue conditions. A comprehensive database is created from these simulations, detailing critical parameters such as CEM43 isodose maps, temperature changes, thermal dose areas, and maximum ablation distances for four directional probes. This database serves as a valuable resource for future studies, aiding in complex trajectory planning and parameter optimization for NBTU procedures. Moreover, a novel probe selection method is proposed to enhance pre-surgical planning, providing a strategic approach to selecting probes that maximize therapeutic efficiency and minimize ablation time. By avoiding unnecessary thermal propagation and optimizing probe angles, this method has the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline surgical procedures. Overall, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the field of NBTU, offering a robust framework for enhancing treatment precision and efficacy in clinical settings."
