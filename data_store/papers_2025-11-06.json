      "abstract": "The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes",

Analyzing 62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.

      "abstract": "The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls. Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation, we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.",

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast and clinically scalable solution.

Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance.

This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.",

We propose BRAINS (Biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring. BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk. Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base. These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in the field.",

Although cognitive control has been extensively studied as a dynamic feedback loop of perception, valuation, and action, it remains incompletely understood as a cohesive dynamic and distributed neural process. Here, we critically examine the history of and advances in the study of cognitive control, including how metaphors and cultural norms of power, morality, and rationality are intertwined with definitions of control, to consider holistically how different models explain which brain regions act as controllers. Controllers, the source of top-down signals, are typically localized in regions whose neural activations implement elementary component processes of control, including conflict monitoring and behavioral inhibition. Top-down signals from these regions guide the activation of other task-specific regions, biasing them towards task-specific activity patterns. A relatively new approach, network control theory, has roots in dynamical systems theory and systems engineering. This approach can mathematically show that controllers are regions with strongly nested and recurrent anatomical connectivity that efficiently propagate top-down signals, and precisely estimate the amount, location, and timing of signaling required to bias global activity to task-specific patterns. The theory converges with prior evidence, offers new mathematical tools and intuitions for understanding control loops across levels of analysis, and naturally produces graded predictions of control across brain regions and modules of psychological function that have been unconsidered or marginalized. We describe how prior approaches converge and diverge, noting directions for future integration to improve understanding of how the brain instantiates cognitive control.",

Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context, peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked example using openly available EEG data.

These signals are used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications. However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline. NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover, in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97% accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which performed at 74% accuracy.

We present STAN, an Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Network that jointly models spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics through cascaded attention blocks with alternating spatial and temporal modules. Unlike existing approaches that assume fixed preictal durations or separately process spatial and temporal features, STAN captures bidirectional dependencies between spatial and temporal patterns through a unified cascaded architecture. Adversarial training with gradient penalty enables robust discrimination between interictal and preictal states learned from clearly defined 15-minute preictal windows. Continuous 90-minute pre-seizure monitoring reveals that the learned spatio-temporal attention patterns enable early detection: reliable alarms trigger at subject-specific times (typically 15-45 minutes before onset), reflecting the model's capacity to capture subtle preictal dynamics without requiring individualized training. Experiments on two benchmark EEG datasets (CHB-MIT scalp: 8 subjects, 46 events; MSSM intracranial: 4 subjects, 14 events) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: 96.6% sensitivity with 0.011 false detections per hour and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063 false detections per hour, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency (2.3M parameters, 45 ms latency, 180 MB memory) for real-time edge deployment.

In this work, we investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance, consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the broader time series literature.",

We observed that system accuracy was directly related to users' trust and modulated the influence of recommendation cues on music preference. Modelling users' reward encoding process with a reinforcement learning model further revealed that system accuracy, expected reward, and prediction error were related to oscillatory neural activity recorded via EEG and changes in pupil diameter.

Analyzing 62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. By integrating spatially stable ROIs with dynamic temporal agreement, our hybrid classification systematically outperforms whole-brain approaches in different frequency bands (up to 5.4% depending on the connectivity method and the spectral range) while maintaining millisecond-level temporal precision.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish cross-subject ROI consensus through source-space connectivity, bypassing scalp EEG's depth constraints to probe Alzheimer's-relevant networks. The framework's robustness to noise and compatibility with portable systems offer significant potential for global deployment in early neurodegenerative disease detection. Future integration of individualized anatomical data or adaptive parameter optimization could refine this tool for clinical deployment, enhancing the current max accuracy of 81.57% in the 1-15 Hz range.",

Compared with conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal stability and immunocompatibility.

In evoked potential tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over 112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable through 168 days.

Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds.

Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.",

The RDWT performs an undecimated, multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head for causal temporal integration.   Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds, RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by +0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 / +2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest computational overhead.

EEG spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps, then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density recordings.",

Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation, we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.",

It allows the cluster-forming threshold to be increased in order to locate the signal with greater spatial precision without overfitting, also known as the drill-down approach. Notip and pARI are two recent permutation-based extensions of ARI designed to increase statistical power by accounting for the strong dependence structure typical of fMRI data. A recent comparison between these papers based on large voxel clusters concluded that pARI outperforms Notip. We revisit this conclusion by conducting a systematic comparison of the two. Our reanalysis of the same fMRI data sets from the Neurovault database demonstrates the existence of complementary performance regimes: while pARI indeed achieves higher sensitivity for large clusters, Notip provides more informative and robust results for smaller clusters. In particular, while Notip supports informative ``drill-down'' exploration into subregions of activation, pARI often yields non-informative bounds in such cases, and can even underperform the baseline ARI method.",

In this study, we explore region-aware reconstruction strategies for a foundation model in resting-state fMRI, moving beyond approaches that rely on random region masking. Specifically, we introduce an ROI-guided masking strategy using the Automated Anatomical Labelling Atlas (AAL3), applied directly to full 4D fMRI volumes to selectively mask semantically coherent brain regions during self-supervised pretraining. Using the ADHD-200 dataset comprising 973 subjects with resting-state fMRI scans, we show that our method achieves a 4.23% improvement in classification accuracy for distinguishing healthy controls from individuals diagnosed with ADHD, compared to conventional random masking. Region-level attribution analysis reveals that brain volumes within the limbic region and cerebellum contribute most significantly to reconstruction fidelity and model representation. Our results demonstrate that masking anatomical regions during model pretraining not only enhances interpretability but also yields more robust and discriminative representations. In future work, we plan to extend this approach by evaluating it on additional neuroimaging datasets, and developing new loss functions explicitly derived from region-aware reconstruction objectives.

Across extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses, we show that RSA leads to lower model selection accuracy, regardless of sample size, noise level, feature dimensionality, or multicollinearity, relative to regression. While principal component analysis and feature reweighting mitigate RSA's deficits driven by multicollinearity, regression remains superior in accurately distinguishing between models.

      "abstract": "Advances in data analysis and machine learning have revolutionized the study of brain signatures using fMRI, enabling non-invasive exploration of cognition and behavior through individual neural patterns. Functional connectivity (FC), which quantifies statistical relationships between brain regions, has emerged as a key metric for studying individual variability and developing biomarkers for personalized medicine in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The concept of subject fingerprinting, introduced by Finn et al. (2015), leverages neural connectivity variability to identify individuals based on their unique patterns. While traditional FC methods perform well on small datasets, machine learning techniques are more effective with larger datasets, isolating individual-specific features and maximizing inter-subject differences. In this study, we propose a framework combining convolutional autoencoders and sparse dictionary learning to enhance fingerprint accuracy. Autoencoders capture shared connectivity patterns while isolating subject-specific features in residual FC matrices, which are analyzed using sparse coding to identify distinctive features. Tested on the Human Connectome Project dataset, this approach achieved a 10% improvement over baseline group-averaged FC models. Our results highlight the potential of integrating deep learning and sparse coding techniques for scalable and robust functional connectome fingerprinting, advancing personalized neuroscience applications and biomarker development.",

Despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT), allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image. BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.",

Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context, peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked example using openly available EEG data.

That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.",

We model the molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate non-rotating components of the molecular gas -- the most likely contributor to future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and within the central kiloparsec.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.",

While functional MRI is currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL) algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity measures for a multi-class classifier.",

The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology.

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g. accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

      "abstract": "Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

      "abstract": "Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

Humans are an attractive model for AI safety: as the only known agents capable of general intelligence, they perform robustly even under conditions that deviate significantly from prior experiences, explore the world safely, understand pragmatics, and can cooperate to meet their intrinsic goals. Intelligence, when coupled with cooperation and safety mechanisms, can drive sustained progress and well-being. These properties are a function of the architecture of the brain and the learning algorithms it implements. Neuroscience may thus hold important keys to technical AI safety that are currently underexplored and underutilized. In this roadmap, we highlight and critically evaluate several paths toward AI safety inspired by neuroscience: emulating the brain's representations, information processing, and architecture; building robust sensory and motor systems from imitating brain data and bodies; fine-tuning AI systems on brain data; advancing interpretability using neuroscience methods; and scaling up cognitively-inspired architectures. We make several concrete recommendations for how neuroscience can positively impact AI safety.",

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.",

While segmentation refinement strategies can improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation time.

In this work, we propose a multinomial classification framework for compositional microbiome data based on penalized log-ratio regression and pairwise separability screening. The method quantifies the discriminative ability of each OTU through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ($AUC$) for all pairwise log-ratios and aggregates these values into a global separability index $S_k$, yielding interpretable rankings of taxa together with confidence intervals. We illustrate the approach by reanalyzing the Baxter colorectal adenoma dataset and comparing our results with Greenacre's ordination-based analysis using Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Our models consistently recover a core subset of taxa previously identified as discriminant, thereby corroborating Greenacre's main findings, while also revealing additional OTUs that become important once demographic covariates are taken into account. In particular, adjustment for age, gender, and diabetes medication improves the precision of the separation index and highlights new, potentially relevant taxa, suggesting that part of the original signal may have been influenced by confounding. Overall, the integration of log-ratio modeling, covariate adjustment, and uncertainty estimation provides a robust and interpretable framework for OTU selection in compositional microbiome data. The proposed method complements existing ordination-based approaches by adding a probabilistic and inferential perspective, strengthening the identification of biologically meaningful microbial signatures.",

      "abstract": "Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45 TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE) QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2) apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10 testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL $85.93\\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05) improvements for five OARs.
