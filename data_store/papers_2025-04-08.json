      "abstract": "Pretrain techniques, whether supervised or self-supervised, are widely used in deep learning to enhance model performance. In real-world clinical scenarios, different sets of magnetic resonance (MR) contrasts are often acquired for different subjects/cases, creating challenges for deep learning models assuming consistent input modalities among all the cases and between pretrain and finetune. Existing methods struggle to maintain performance when there is an input modality/contrast set mismatch with the pretrained model, often resulting in degraded accuracy. We propose an adaptive Vision Transformer (AdaViT) framework capable of handling variable set of input modalities for each case. We utilize a dynamic tokenizer to encode different input image modalities to tokens and take advantage of the characteristics of the transformer to build attention mechanism across variable length of tokens. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this architecture effectively transfers supervised pretrained models to new datasets with different input modality/contrast sets, resulting in superior performance on zero-shot testing, few-shot finetuning, and backward transferring in brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation tasks. Additionally, for self-supervised pretrain, the proposed method is able to maximize the pretrain data and facilitate transferring to diverse downstream tasks with variable sets of input modalities."

By leveraging existing automatic segmentation methods, we train a network to approximate segmentations, typically obtained from T1-weighted MRIs. Our method, called FLAIRBrainSeg, produces segmentations of 132 structures and is robust to multiple sclerosis lesions. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms modality-agnostic approaches based on image synthesis, the only currently available alternative for performing brain parcellation using FLAIR MRI alone. This technique holds promise for scenarios where T1-weighted MRIs are unavailable and offers a valuable alternative for clinicians and researchers in need of reliable anatomical segmentation."

This paper introduces a novel pre-model approach leveraging Jacobian Maps (JMs) within a multi-modal framework to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in AD detection. By capturing localized brain volume changes, JMs establish meaningful correlations between model predictions and well-known neuroanatomical biomarkers of AD. We validate JMs through experiments comparing a 3D CNN trained on JMs versus on traditional preprocessed data, which demonstrates superior accuracy. We also employ 3D Grad-CAM analysis to provide both visual and quantitative insights, further showcasing improved interpretability and diagnostic reliability."

      "abstract": "The slowing of Moore's law and the increasing energy demands of machine learning present critical challenges for both the hardware and machine learning communities, and drive the development of novel computing paradigms. Of particular interest is the challenge of incorporating memory efficiently into the learning process. Inspired by how human brains store and retrieve information, associative memory mechanisms provide a class of computational methods that can store and retrieve patterns in a robust, energy-efficient manner. Existing associative memory architectures, such as the celebrated Hopfield model and oscillatory associative memory networks, store patterns as stable equilibria of network dynamics. However, the capacity (i.e. the number of patterns that a network can memorize normalized by their number of nodes) of existing oscillatory models have been shown to decrease with the size of the network, making them impractical for large-scale, real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory architecture based on Kuramoto oscillators. We show that the capacity of our associative memory network increases exponentially with network size and features no spurious memories. In addition, we present algorithms and numerical experiments to support these theoretical findings, providing guidelines for the hardware implementation of the proposed associative memory networks."

      "abstract": "In light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), the axial resolution is governed by the illumination beam profile, motivating the development of advanced beam-shaping techniques to enhance imaging performance. Two-photon LSFM (2P-LSFM), in particular, improves the signal-to-background ratio by reducing laser scattering and distortion in biological specimens. However, we report a potentially detrimental thermal effect in 2P-LSFM: the high laser powers required for two-photon excitation induce localized heating, which alters the refractive index of the medium and effectively forms a divergent thermal lens in water. At 500 mW the light-sheet waist broadens by 25% and shifts by 300 $\\mu$m before stabilizing several seconds after the laser shutter is opened. Both experiments and simulations reveal that this thermal lensing effect scales with laser power and the path length the beam travels through water. The resulting degradation in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio may compromise imaging applications that require high laser powers for rapid volumetric imaging of large specimens or functional brain imaging. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic sample environments, such as during stepwise repositioning or flow-based delivery of chemical or hydrodynamic sensory stimuli, where changes occur on timescales comparable to the thermal settling time."

Following the principles of the human brain, spiking neural networks trained with unsupervised learning offer a faster, more energy-efficient alternative. However, the dynamics of spiking, learning, and forgetting become more complicated in such schemes. Here we study a superconducting electronics implementation of a learning synapse and experimentally measure its spiking dynamics. By pulsing the system with a superconducting neuron, we show that a superconducting inductor can dynamically hold the synaptic weight with updates due to learning and forgetting. Learning can be stopped by slowing down the arrival time of the post-synaptic pulse, in accordance with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity paradigm. We find excellent agreement with circuit simulations, and by fitting the turn-on of the pulsing frequency, we confirm a learning time of 16.1 +/- 1 ps. The power dissipation in the learning part of the synapse is less than one attojoule per learning event. This leads to the possibility of an extremely fast and energy-efficient learning processor."

Unlike the previous GPTQ method, which independently calibrates each layer, we always match the quantized layer's output to the exact output in the full-precision model, resulting in a scheme that we call asymmetric calibration. Such a scheme can effectively reduce the quantization error accumulated in previous layers. We analyze this problem using optimal brain compression to derive a close-formed solution. The new solution explicitly minimizes the quantization error as well as the accumulated asymmetry error. Furthermore, we utilize various techniques to parallelize the solution calculation, including channel parallelization, neuron decomposition, and Cholesky reformulation for matrix fusion. As a result, GPTQv2 is easy to implement, simply using 20 more lines of code than GPTQ but improving its performance under low-bit quantization. Remarkably, on a single GPU, we quantize a 405B language transformer as well as EVA-02 the rank first vision transformer that achieves 90% pretraining Imagenet accuracy.

      "abstract": "A Literature Review of Reservoir Computing.   Even before Artificial Intelligence was its own field of computational science, humanity has tried to mimic the activity of the human brain. In the early 1940s the first artificial neuron models were created as purely mathematical concepts. Over the years, ideas from neuroscience and computer science were used to develop the modern Neural Network. The interest in these models rose quickly but fell when they failed to be successfully applied to practical applications, and rose again in the late 2000s with the drastic increase in computing power, notably in the field of natural language processing, for example with the state-of-the-art speech recognizer making heavy use of deep neural networks.   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a class of neural networks with cycles in the network, exacerbates the difficulties of traditional neural nets. Slow convergence limiting the use to small networks, and difficulty to train through gradient-descent methods because of the recurrent dynamics have hindered research on RNNs, yet their biological plausibility and their capability to model dynamical systems over simple functions makes then interesting for computational researchers.   Reservoir Computing emerges as a solution to these problems that RNNs traditionally face. Promising to be both theoretically sound and computationally fast, Reservoir Computing has already been applied successfully to numerous fields: natural language processing, computational biology and neuroscience, robotics, even physics. This survey will explore the history and appeal of both traditional feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, before describing the theory and models of this new reservoir computing paradigm. Finally recent papers using reservoir computing in a variety of scientific fields will be reviewed."

Many existing models do not fully capture the complex, multiscale interactions among neuronal activity, astrocytic signaling, and vascular dynamics--especially in key brainstem regions. In this work, we present a 3D-1D-0D multiscale computational framework for modeling the neuro-glial-vascular unit (NGVU) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Our approach integrates a quadripartite synapse model--which represents the interplay among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells--with a hierarchical description of vascular dynamics that couples a three-dimensional microcirculatory network with a one-dimensional macrocirculatory representation and a zero-dimensional synaptic component. By linking neuronal spiking, astrocytic calcium and gliotransmitter signaling, and vascular tone regulation, our model reproduces key features of functional hyperemia and elucidates the feedback loops that help maintain cerebral blood flow. Simulation results demonstrate that neurotransmitter release triggers astrocytic responses that modulate vessel radius to optimize oxygen and nutrient delivery. This integrated framework, to our knowledge the first model to combine these elements for the NGVU in the DVC, provides a robust and modular platform for future investigations into the pathophysiology of cerebral blood flow regulation and its role in autonomic control, including the regulation of stomach function."

CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates."

      "abstract": "Background: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) can reduce seizure duration, but their precise modes of action are unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether ASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a shorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity patterns.   Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from 28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure occurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns (states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these to different ASM levels.   Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p < 0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:   Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering unmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these 'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).   Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without taper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224% longer durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p < 0.001).   Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress specific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and (ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight the complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized dosing strategies for epilepsy management. These findings may also have implications in understanding the effects of ASMs on cognition and mood.",

While its effect has been validated through behavioral studies and neuro-physiological measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related bio-signal analyses, its development and triggers remain a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that its triggers are highly linked with cyclic patterns: predictable patterns introduce relaxation while variations maintain intrigue. To validate this and further understand the impact of acoustic features on ASMR effects, we designed three distinct cyclic patterns with monophonic and stereophonic variations, while controlling their predictability and randomness, and collected ASMR triggering scores through online surveys. Then, we extracted cyclic features and carried out regression analysis, seeking an explainable mapping of cyclic features and ASMR triggers. We found that relaxing effects accumulate progressively and are independent of spatial orientation. Cyclic patterns significantly influence psychological and physical effects, which remain invariant with time. Regression analysis revealed that smoothly spread and energy-dense cyclic patterns most effectively trigger ASMR responses."

Methods: EEG signals are acquired through active electrodes and processed using a custom-designed analog front end (AFE) that filters and digitizes the captured EEG signals. The adjustable headset is designed using three-dimensional (3D) printing and laser cutting to fit a wide range of head sizes. A deep learning model is developed to classify seizure and non-seizure epochs in real-time. Furthermore, a separate multimodal deep learning model is designed to remove noise artifacts. The device is tested on a pediatric patient with absence seizures in a hospital setting. Simultaneous recordings are captured using both the custom device and the commercial wet electrode device available in the hospital for comparison. Results: The signals obtained using our custom design and a commercial device show a high correlation (>0.8). Further analysis using signal-to-noise ratio values shows that our device can mitigate noise similar to the commercial device. The proposed deep learning model has improvements in accuracy and recall by 2.76% and 16.33%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art.

Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals.

Interactive systems can counteract this bias by suggesting alternative perspectives, but they require real-time indicators to identify selective exposure. This workshop paper proposes the integration of physiological sensing, including Electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking, to measure selective exposure. We propose methods for examining news agreement and its relationship to theta band power in the parietal region, indicating a potential link between cortical activity and selective exposure. Our vision is interactive systems that detect selective exposure and provide alternative views in real time. We suggest that future news interfaces incorporate physiological signals to promote more balanced information consumption.

      "abstract": "Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining serves as a valuable technique for detecting specific antigens or proteins through antibody-mediated visualization. However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis."

Currently, there are two major challenges in the storage and management of BCI data: providing different classification storage modes for multi-modal data, and adapting to varying application scenarios while improving storage strategies. To address these challenges, this study has developed the NeuroStore BCI data persistence system, which provides a general and easily scalable data model and can effectively handle multiple types of data storage.

Recent studies have reported higher-than-chance performance in decoding handwritten letters from EEG signals, potentially allowing these subjects to communicate. However, all prior works have attempted to decode handwriting from EEG during actual motion. Furthermore, they assume that precise movement-onset is known. In this work, we focus on settings closer to real-world use where either movement onset is not known or movement does not occur at all, fully utilizing motor imagery. We show that several existing studies are affected by confounds that make them inapplicable to the imagined handwriting setting. We also investigate how sample complexity affects handwriting decoding performance, guiding future data collection efforts. Our work shows that (a) Sample complexity analysis in single-trial EEG reveals a noise ceiling, which can be alleviated by averaging over trials. (b) Knowledge of movement-onset is crucial to reported performance in prior works. (c) Fully imagined handwriting can be decoded from EEG with higher-than-chance performance. Taken together, these results highlight both the unique challenges and avenues to pursue to build a practical EEG-based handwriting BCI."

To address the issue, we propose a novel multi-channel asymmetrical variational discrete cosine transform (DCT) network for EEG data compression within an edge-fog computing framework. At the edge level, low-complexity DCT compression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and scaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent space representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to merge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by leveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed multi-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies and reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles of variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss function, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior compression performance without sacrificing any useful information for BCI detection compared with state-of-the-art techniques, indicating a feasible solution for EEG data compression."

Despite their benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on neurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In this context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt spontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition. Previous work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced number of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this limitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal Flooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of the primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons, tested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting gratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus, also testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results, based on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the attacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and fixed events are the most robust. Although both attacks can significantly affect neural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal delays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many neurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO increased with the number of neurons attacked.",

To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers.

These limitations hinder the effective comparison of brain networks between cognitive states, making it difficult to analyze network reconfiguration during task and resting states. To address these issues, we propose BOLDSimNet, a novel framework utilizing Multivariate Transfer Entropy (MTE) to measure causal connectivity and network similarity across different cognitive states. Our method groups functionally similar regions of interest (ROIs) rather than spatially adjacent nodes, improving accuracy in network alignment. We applied BOLDSimNet to fMRI data from 40 healthy controls and found that children exhibited higher similarity scores between task and resting states compared to adolescents, indicating reduced variability in attention shifts. In contrast, adolescents showed more differences between task and resting states in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN), reflecting enhanced network adaptability. These findings emphasize developmental variations in the reconfiguration of the causal brain network, showcasing BOLDSimNet's ability to quantify network similarity and identify attentional fluctuations between different cognitive states."

This naturally raises the question: Can we enhance the spatiotemporal resolution and SNR of 3T BOLD fMRI data to approximate 7T quality? In this study, we propose a novel framework that aligns 7T and 3T fMRI data from different subjects and datasets in a shared parametric domain.

We address this gap by comparing word representations from contrastive multimodal models vs. language-only ones in the extent to which they capture experiential information -- as defined by an existing norm-based 'experiential model' -- and align with human fMRI responses. Our results indicate that, surprisingly, language-only models are superior to multimodal ones in both respects.

It first decomposes the video into three components - semantic, spatial, and motion - then decodes each component separately before fusing them to reconstruct the video. This approach not only simplifies the complex task of video decoding by decomposing it into manageable sub-tasks, but also establishes a clearer connection between learned representations and their biological counterpart, as supported by ablation studies. Further, our experiments show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 82.4% accuracy for semantic classification, 70.6% accuracy in spatial consistency, a 0.212 cosine similarity for motion prediction, and 21.9% 50-way accuracy for video generation.

Transformer-based architectures, known for capturing long-range dependencies, align well with the brain's hierarchical and temporal organization.

MBBN achieves up to 30.59% higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the advantage of frequency-informed spatiotemporal modeling in capturing latent neural computations. MBBN's interpretability uncovers novel frequency-specific biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders, providing insights into the hierarchical organization of brain function.

To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance.

Model-heterogeneous FL (MHFL) extends this paradigm by allowing clients to train personalized models with heterogeneous architectures tailored to their computational resources and application-specific needs. However, existing MHFL methods predominantly rely on centralized aggregation, which introduces scalability and efficiency bottlenecks, or impose restrictions requiring partially identical model architectures across clients. While peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes server dependence, it suffers from model drift and knowledge dilution, limiting its effectiveness in heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedSKD, a novel MHFL framework that facilitates direct knowledge exchange through round-robin model circulation, eliminating the need for centralized aggregation while allowing fully heterogeneous model architectures across clients. FedSKD's key innovation lies in multi-dimensional similarity knowledge distillation, which enables bidirectional cross-client knowledge transfer at batch, pixel/voxel, and region levels for heterogeneous models in FL. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and model drift through progressive reinforcement and distribution alignment while preserving model heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on fMRI-based autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and skin lesion classification demonstrate that FedSKD outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous FL baselines, achieving superior personalization (client-specific accuracy) and generalization (cross-institutional adaptability). These findings underscore FedSKD's potential as a scalable and robust solution for real-world medical federated learning applications."

      "abstract": "In daily life, we encounter diverse external stimuli, such as images, sounds, and videos. As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness. Finally, it identifies key challenges and proposes future research directions, offering valuable insights for the field.

We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing."

However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication."

For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments."

Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients."

To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain."

The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems.

However, MEG scan data in certain spectrum ranges can be skewed, multimodal and heterogeneous which can mislead the conventional case-control analysis that requires the data to be homogeneous and normally distributed within the control group. To meet this challenge, we propose a flexible one-vs-K-sample testing procedure for detecting brain injury for a single-case versus heterogeneous controls. The new procedure begins with source magnitude imaging using MEG scan data in frequency domain, followed by region-wise contrast tests for abnormality between the case and controls. The critical values for these tests are automatically determined by cross-validation. We adjust the testing results for heterogeneity effects by similarity analysis. An asymptotic theory is established for the proposed test statistic. By simulated and real data analyses in the context of neurotrauma, we show that the proposed test outperforms commonly used nonparametric methods in terms of overall accuracy and ability in accommodating data non-normality and subject-heterogeneity."

Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision."

      "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.",

While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI."

In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner.

We show drastic improvements in model-V1 alignment driven by the integration of architectural components that simulate center-surround antagonism, local receptive fields, tuned normalization, and cortical magnification. Upon enhancing task-driven CNNs with a collection of these specialized components, we uncover models with latent representations that yield state-of-the-art explanation of V1 neural activity and tuning properties. Our results highlight an important advancement in the field of NeuroAI, as we systematically establish a set of architectural components that contribute to unprecedented explanation of V1. The neuroscience insights that could be gleaned from increasingly accurate in-silico models of the brain have the potential to greatly advance the fields of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence."

      "abstract": "The quality of synthetically generated images (e.g. those produced by diffusion models) are often evaluated using information about image contents encoded by pretrained auxiliary models. For example, the Fr\\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) uses embeddings from an InceptionV3 model pretrained to classify ImageNet. The effectiveness of this feature embedding model has considerable impact on the trustworthiness of the calculated metric (affecting its suitability in several domains, including medical imaging). Here, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is used to provide a heuristic measure of the trustworthiness of the feature embedding model and an FID-like metric called the Fr\\'{e}chet Autoencoder Distance (FAED). We apply Monte Carlo dropout to a feature embedding model (convolutional autoencoder) to model the uncertainty in its embeddings. The distribution of embeddings for each input are then used to compute a distribution of FAED values. We express uncertainty as the predictive variance of the embeddings as well as the standard deviation of the computed FAED values. We find that their magnitude correlates with the extent to which the inputs are out-of-distribution to the model's training data, providing some validation of its ability to assess the trustworthiness of the FAED."

However, there have been limited studies on building general-purpose models for 3D images and videos with comprehensive user studies. Here, we present MedSAM2, a promptable segmentation foundation model for 3D image and video segmentation. The model is developed by fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model 2 on a large medical dataset with over 455,000 3D image-mask pairs and 76,000 frames, outperforming previous models across a wide range of organs, lesions, and imaging modalities. Furthermore, we implement a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the creation of large-scale datasets resulting in, to the best of our knowledge, the most extensive user study to date, involving the annotation of 5,000 CT lesions, 3,984 liver MRI lesions, and 251,550 echocardiogram video frames, demonstrating that MedSAM2 can reduce manual costs by more than 85%. MedSAM2 is also integrated into widely used platforms with user-friendly interfaces for local and cloud deployment, making it a practical tool for supporting efficient, scalable, and high-quality segmentation in both research and healthcare environments."

      "abstract": "Pretrain techniques, whether supervised or self-supervised, are widely used in deep learning to enhance model performance. In real-world clinical scenarios, different sets of magnetic resonance (MR) contrasts are often acquired for different subjects/cases, creating challenges for deep learning models assuming consistent input modalities among all the cases and between pretrain and finetune. Existing methods struggle to maintain performance when there is an input modality/contrast set mismatch with the pretrained model, often resulting in degraded accuracy. We propose an adaptive Vision Transformer (AdaViT) framework capable of handling variable set of input modalities for each case. We utilize a dynamic tokenizer to encode different input image modalities to tokens and take advantage of the characteristics of the transformer to build attention mechanism across variable length of tokens. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this architecture effectively transfers supervised pretrained models to new datasets with different input modality/contrast sets, resulting in superior performance on zero-shot testing, few-shot finetuning, and backward transferring in brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation tasks. Additionally, for self-supervised pretrain, the proposed method is able to maximize the pretrain data and facilitate transferring to diverse downstream tasks with variable sets of input modalities."

      "abstract": "This study addresses the essential task of medical image segmentation, which involves the automatic identification and delineation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images. Accurate segmentation is crucial in radiology, as it aids in the precise localization of abnormalities such as tumors, thereby enabling effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression. Specifically, the size, shape, and location of tumors can significantly influence clinical decision-making and therapeutic strategies, making accurate segmentation a key component of radiological workflows. However, challenges posed by variations in MRI modalities, image artifacts, and the scarcity of labeled data complicate the segmentation task and impact the performance of traditional models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised learning Multi-encoder nnU-Net architecture designed to process multiple MRI modalities independently through separate encoders. This approach allows the model to capture modality-specific features before fusing them for the final segmentation, thus improving accuracy. Our Multi-encoder nnU-Net demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 93.72%, which surpasses that of other models such as vanilla nnU-Net, SegResNet, and Swin UNETR. By leveraging the unique information provided by each modality, the model enhances segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated data. Evaluations highlight the effectiveness of this architecture in improving tumor segmentation outcomes."

The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for ML classification, and illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the VIM and GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models."

      "abstract": "Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) answers clinical questions using medical images, aiding diagnosis. Designing the MedVQA system holds profound importance in assisting clinical diagnosis and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Building upon this foundation, Hierarchical Medical VQA extends Medical VQA by organizing medical questions into a hierarchical structure and making level-specific predictions to handle fine-grained distinctions. Recently, many studies have proposed hierarchical MedVQA tasks and established datasets, However, several issues still remain: (1) imperfect hierarchical modeling leads to poor differentiation between question levels causing semantic fragmentation across hierarchies. (2) Excessive reliance on implicit learning in Transformer-based cross-modal self-attention fusion methods, which obscures crucial local semantic correlations in medical scenarios. To address these issues, this study proposes a HiCA-VQA method, including two modules: Hierarchical Prompting for fine-grained medical questions and Hierarchical Answer Decoders. The hierarchical prompting module pre-aligns hierarchical text prompts with image features to guide the model in focusing on specific image regions according to question types, while the hierarchical decoder performs separate predictions for questions at different levels to improve accuracy across granularities. The framework also incorporates a cross-attention fusion module where images serve as queries and text as key-value pairs. Experiments on the Rad-Restruct benchmark demonstrate that the HiCA-VQA framework better outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in answering hierarchical fine-grained questions. This study provides an effective pathway for hierarchical visual question answering systems, advancing medical image understanding."

      "abstract": "Background:Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Vision Transformers(ViT) are the main techniques used in Medical image segmentation. However, CNN is limited to local contextual information, and ViT's quadratic complexity results in significant computational costs. At the same time, equipping the model to distinguish lesion boundaries with varying degrees of severity is also a challenge encountered in skin lesion segmentation. Purpose:This research aims to optimize the balance between computational costs and long-range dependency modelling and achieve excellent generalization across lesions with different degrees of severity. Methods:we propose a lightweight U-shape network that utilizes Vision Fastformer with Fusion Mechanism (VFFM-UNet). We inherit the advantages of Fastformer's additive attention mechanism, combining element-wise product and matrix product for comprehensive feature extraction and channel reduction to save computational costs. In order to accurately identify the lesion boundaries with varying degrees of severity, we designed Fusion Mechanism including Multi-Granularity Fusion and Channel Fusion, which can process the feature maps in the granularity and channel levels to obtain different contextual information. Results:Comprehensive experiments on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018 and PH2 datasets demonstrate that VFFM-UNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models regarding parameter numbers, computational complexity and segmentation performance. In short, compared to MISSFormer, our model achieves superior segmentation performance while reducing parameter and computation costs by 101x and 15x, respectively. Conclusions:Both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that VFFM-UNet sets a new benchmark by reaching an ideal balance between parameter numbers, computational complexity, and segmentation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models."
