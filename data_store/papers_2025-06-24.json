      "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases."

      "abstract": "Traditional artificial neural networks consist of nodes with non-oscillatory dynamics. Biological neural networks, on the other hand, consist of oscillatory components embedded in an oscillatory environment. Motivated by this feature of biological neurons, we describe a reservoir computing framework with explicit damped, oscillatory node dynamics. We express the oscillatory dynamics using two history dependent terms to connect these dynamics with existing artificial neural network approaches and apply physical and stationary constraints to reduce the number of free parameters. We then optimize and illustrate reservoir performance by classifying different brain rhythms associated with epilepsy and show that reservoir elements support classification by resonating with features of the input signals. Applying the same reservoir network to visual and auditory signal types, we show the reservoir generalizes for accurate classification with few trainable parameters. Compared to existing artificial neural network approaches, the proposed resonant reservoir network (RRN) utilizes oscillatory dynamics expressed as a straightforward extension of traditional artificial neural networks, produces interpretable features for classification, avoids computationally expensive training (e.g., backpropagation), and performs well with few parameters in different classification scenarios. We propose that RRNs may serve as efficient, biologically implemented building blocks to achieve complex goals in biological and artificial neural networks."

      "abstract": "In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET) is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework, with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers, the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns, thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant information.

In particular, numerous advanced methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.   To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020 benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy, offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

The model accommodates multiplicative random effects whose marginalization yields a novel Tucker-decomposed covariance-tensor framework. To ensure scalability, we employ semi-orthogonal mode matrices implemented via a novel graph-Laplacian-based smoothness prior with low-rank approximation, leading to an efficient posterior sampling method. A cumulative shrinkage strategy promotes sparsity and enables semiautomated rank selection. We establish theoretical guarantees for posterior convergence and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through simulations, showing significant improvements over existing techniques. Applying the method to Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) neuroimaging data reveals novel insights into local brain changes associated with disease progression, highlighting the method's practical utility for studying cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions."

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data."

Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free, multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters."

      "abstract": "Merely by existing, all physical systems contain information, and physical dynamics transforms and processes that information. This note investigates the information processing power of living systems. Living systems harvest free energy from the sun, from geothermal sources, and from each other. They then use that free energy to drive the complex set of chemical interactions that underlie life. All molecules -- be they simple molecules such as water, or complex molecules such as DNA -- register information via their chemical composition. When these molecules undergo chemical reactions, that information is transformed and processed. These chemical transformations can be thought of as elementary logical operations: such bio-ops include the absorption of a photon in a chromophore during photosynthesis, the formation or breaking of covalent, hydrogen, and van der Waals bonds in the process of metabolism and reproduction, or the release of a neurotransmitter molecule when a synapse fires in the brain. This paper estimates the total number of bio-ops that have been, and are being performed, by life on earth. We find that the current number of bio-ops performed by all life on earth is around $10^{33}-10^{35}$ bio-ops per second. The cells in an individual human being perform around $10^{20}-10^{22}$ bio-ops per second, comparable to the information processing power of all the computers, cell phones, and server farms on earth. Depending on how one defines a neural operation, at most a few percent of human bio-ops take place in the firing of neurons and synapses in the brain. Over the course of life on earth, about $10^{50}-10^{52}$ bio-ops have taken place."

      "abstract": "Reconstructing the attractors of complex nonlinear dynamical systems from available measurements is key to analyse and predict their time evolution. Existing attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological embedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from the actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often available only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and the time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of Homogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more faithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous Differentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their de-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with time-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We apply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of increasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and the Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG recordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain drastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as well as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of magnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the flexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that they can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and reconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical models and real data."

The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns.

However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting its strong generalization ability."

Results showed a significant reduction in the power of alpha waves during the background noise attention task, suggesting increased cognitive load.

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in how machines \"see\" and \"understand\" language, are now fueling exciting progress in decoding brain signals from scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Prima facie, this opens the door to revolutionary brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed for real life, moving beyond traditional uses to envision Brain-to-Speech, Brain-to-Image, and even a Brain-to-Internet of Things (BCIoT).   However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.   Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations.

Advanced AI algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can autonomously make decisions to achieve planning and motion goals. However, in healthcare, where human intent is crucial, fully independent machine decisions may not be ideal. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of human-centered shared autonomy AI frameworks, focusing on upper limb biosignal-based machine interfaces and associated motor control systems, including computer cursors, robotic arms, and planar platforms. We examine motor planning, learning (rehabilitation), and control, covering conceptual foundations of human-machine teaming in reach-and-grasp tasks and analyzing both theoretical and practical implementations. Each section explores how human and machine inputs can be blended for shared autonomy in healthcare applications. Topics include human factors, biosignal processing for intent detection, shared autonomy in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), rehabilitation, assistive robotics, and Large Language Models (LLMs) as the next frontier. We propose adaptive shared autonomy AI as a high-performance paradigm for collaborative human-AI systems, identify key implementation challenges, and outline future directions, particularly regarding AI reasoning agents. This analysis aims to bridge neuroscientific insights with robotics to create more intuitive, effective, and ethical human-machine teaming frameworks."

However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning."

However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms. The goal is to support the responsible design and application of new BCIs, ensuring their safe and ethical integration into medical practice."

In this paper, we consider this problem for $m$-Cayley digraphs which are generalization of Cayley digraphs. Let $m$ be a positive integer. A digraph admitting a group $G$ of automorphisms acting semiregularly on the vertices with exactly $m$ orbits is called an $m$-Cayley digraph of $G$. In our previous paper, we developed a theory for $m$-Cayley isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and classified finite $m$CI-groups for each $m\\geq 2$, and finite $m$PCI-groups for each $m\\geq 4$. The next natural step is to classify finite $m$PCI-groups for $m=2$ or $3$. Note that BCI-groups form an important subclass of the $2$PCI-groups, which were introduced in 2008 by Xu et al. Despite much effort having been made on the study of BCI-groups, the problem of classifying finite BCI-groups is still widely open.   In this paper, we prove that every finite $2$PCI-group is solvable, and its Sylow $3$-subgroup is isomorphic to $Z_3, Z_3\\times Z_3$ or $Z_9$, and Sylow $p$-subgroup with $p\\not=3$ is either elementary abelian, or isomorphic to $Z_4$ or $Q_8$. We also introduce the kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs, and establish some useful theory for studying this kind of isomorphisms. Using the results of kernel isomorphisms of $m$-Cayley digraphs together with the results on $2$PCI-groups, we give a proper description of finite BCI-groups, and in particular, we obtain a complete classification of finite non-abelian BCI-groups."

Transfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements for the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however, effectively addressing individual variability among both target and source subjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which leverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual contributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general feature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a common latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the unique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we further design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA), which integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify appropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components (TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA frameworks. This study provides a potential solution for developing high-performance SSVEP-based BCIs with reduced target subject data."

However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data."

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.   To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data."

We propose that scale-invariance, a fundamental structural principle in natural systems, is a key driver of this convergence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale analytical framework to quantify two core aspects of scale-invariance in AI representations: dimensional stability and structural similarity across scales. We further investigate whether these properties can predict alignment performance with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses in the visual cortex. Our analysis reveals that embeddings with more consistent dimension and higher structural similarity across scales align better with fMRI data. Furthermore, we find that the manifold structure of fMRI data is more concentrated, with most features dissipating at smaller scales. Embeddings with similar scale patterns align more closely with fMRI data. We also show that larger pretraining datasets and the inclusion of language modalities enhance the scale-invariance properties of embeddings, further improving neural alignment. Our findings indicate that scale-invariance is a fundamental structural principle that bridges artificial and biological representations, providing a new framework for evaluating the structural quality of human-like AI systems."

In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations.

Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future."

Recent work has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models' perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17 pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains, suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be generalized to neural measures."

In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.

      "abstract": "Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test). Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related cognitive decline and NCD."

      "abstract": "Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence. Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool for representation learning.

Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing."

In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.",

Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance."

From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral.

Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications."

Current spatiotemporal learners usually train an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation."

The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development."

To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research."

      "abstract": "Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first \"composition\" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties."

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of NeuroAI. A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library (PRECO) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations."

      "abstract": "How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.",

This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases."

To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings."

Existing studies typically formulated different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances.

Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information, while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios."

We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy."

For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks."

It has been demonstrated that plasma sources can be constructed in such a way that their operation and application are safe, and that they present relevant clinical results. However, the manufacturing and operating costs of plasma sources can be decisive for their adoption in medical procedures. In this work, a simple modification of a plasma source that has a low production cost was investigated in order to evaluate the viability of its use for medical applications using argon as the working gas. Without this modification, the plasma source produces high levels of electrical current, which makes it unfeasible for use in medical applications. With the proposed modification, the treatment is no longer carried out using the plasma jet directly, but rather with the post-discharge effluent enriched with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As a result, the electrical current reaching the target remains below the safety threshold established for plasma applications in humans. Application tests on water activation indicate that both operating conditions can yield comparable outcomes."

Building on the recent demonstration of dark-field imaging at the nanoscale using transmission X-ray microscopy, we extend this technique to retrieve directional small-angle scattering information. By analyzing both a test object and human primary tooth enamel, we show that our transmission X-ray microscopy setup can successfully retrieve directional scattering information with minimal modifications of existing systems. This advancement expands the capabilities of nanoscale dark-field imaging, offering new opportunities for investigating structural properties in a wide range of scientific fields."

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.
